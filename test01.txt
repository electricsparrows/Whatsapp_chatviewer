11/21/15, 07:18 - Cindy L: I went to an intercollegiate event yesterday
11/21/15, 07:18 - Cindy L: Basically other unis perception of lse

11/21/15, 07:19 - Cindy L: Imperial= hard working
11/21/15, 07:19 - Cindy L: Saw a lot of weird ppl from kings
11/21/15, 07:20 - Cindy L: Ucl not so much, but they always seem to think that they do the least number of hrs per week (15)
11/21/15, 07:21 - Cindy L: I probably only met 2 ppl from ucl, they probably don't like lse that much cuz we're rivals
11/21/15, 07:21 - Cindy L: Lol

11/21/15, 07:42 - Emos: yet
11/21/15, 07:41 - Mom: no lah
11/21/15, 07:41 - Mom: she's cant decide
11/21/15, 07:42 - Mom: hi, do u like those ucl guys
11/21/15, 11:09 - Cindy L: Dunno haven't met enough
11/21/15, 11:10 - Mom: just general impression
11/21/15, 11:11 - Cindy L: I seriously don't know, they didn't show up
11/21/15, 11:11 - Cindy L: I've seen 1 or 2 ucl ppl
11/21/15, 11:11 - Mom: nvm
11/21/15, 11:12 - Cindy L: They were alright
11/21/15, 11:12 - Mom: but ucl guys don't like lse guys
11/21/15, 11:12 - Cindy L: I don't think there's really like a 'ucl' type
11/21/15, 11:13 - Cindy L: I guess
11/21/15, 11:13 - Cindy L: Ppl were really similar
11/21/15, 11:13 - Cindy L: Like u cant tell where they were studying without asking
11/21/15, 11:13 - Cindy L: So I think the four unis just accept the same sort of ppl
11/21/15, 11:14 - Mom: ohüòØ
11/21/15, 11:20 - Cindy L: Yea
11/21/15, 11:20 - Cindy L: Though imperial seems unusually intense
11/21/15, 11:21 - Cindy L: I heard they basically go to schl from 9-5
11/21/15, 11:21 - Cindy L: Everday
11/21/15, 11:21 - Mom: üò±
11/21/15, 11:21 - Cindy L: And then this is just maths but they have test every week
11/21/15, 11:21 - Mom: üò±üò±
11/21/15, 11:21 - Cindy L: Which count to 5% of final grade
11/21/15, 11:22 - Cindy L: And the ppl there are very antisocial again
11/21/15, 11:22 - Cindy L: Again alot of french ppl
11/21/15, 11:22 - Cindy L: I asked them where the Germans r, but nobody seems to know
11/21/15, 11:22 - Cindy L: Lol
11/21/15, 11:22 - Cindy L: And mainland ofc
11/21/15, 11:23 - Cindy L: Like the antisocial bit is a very big thing
11/21/15, 11:23 - Cindy L: Literally everyone says that
11/21/15, 11:23 - Mom: I heard a lot of  Singaporeans there
11/21/15, 11:23 - Cindy L: Hmm
11/21/15, 11:23 - Cindy L: No Singaporeans yesterday
11/21/15, 11:23 - Cindy L: Albeit they were all math students
11/21/15, 11:24 - Mom: Singaporeans just do business
11/21/15, 11:24 - Cindy L: Yh I think so too
11/21/15, 11:24 - Mom: a&f
11/21/15, 11:24 - Cindy L: Also the guys tend to do nonprofessional degrees
11/21/15, 11:24 - Cindy L: Cuz they hv to do two yr army
11/21/15, 11:25 - Cindy L: And when they go to uno they are already 21
11/21/15, 11:25 - Cindy L: Singaporean girls..... I haven't met a lot
11/21/15, 11:25 - Cindy L: And I dunno I don't think they would be the type to do science stuff
11/21/15, 11:25 - Cindy L: So in summary
11/21/15, 11:26 - Cindy L: Chinamen dominate everywhere
11/21/15, 11:26 - Cindy L: French ppl must hate studying in their own country
11/21/15, 11:26 - Mom: u know there're 300k+ chinese oversea student in usa
11/21/15, 11:27 - Cindy L: Wow I wouldn't be surprised
11/21/15, 11:27 - Cindy L: In most unis the white ppl are like its just asians everywhere
11/21/15, 11:27 - Mom: but there're only 20k+ hongkonger in usa
11/21/15, 11:27 - Cindy L: Oh
11/21/15, 11:27 - Cindy L: Reasonable
11/21/15, 11:32 - Cindy L: Other things
11/21/15, 11:32 - Cindy L: Ofc lse turn out yesterday was the highest
11/21/15, 11:32 - Cindy L: Probably cuz it was hosted by us
11/21/15, 11:32 - Cindy L: And then kings
11/21/15, 11:33 - Cindy L: Probably cuz they r next door and don't hate us as much
11/21/15, 11:33 - Cindy L: We actually share alot of stuff with kings
11/21/15, 11:33 - Mom: üòÖüòÖ
11/21/15, 11:34 - Cindy L: Sometimes QM ppl show up but they feel like they don't belong cuz they aren't uol
11/21/15, 11:34 - Cindy L: Lol
11/21/15, 11:34 - Cindy L: In general the ppl who are most normal are from these places
11/21/15, 11:35 - Mom: QM not part of uol?
11/21/15, 11:35 - Cindy L: No
11/21/15, 11:35 - Cindy L: But I think their campus is also in london
11/21/15, 11:35 - Mom: no, they shud be part of uol
11/21/15, 11:35 - Cindy L: That's why they join
11/21/15, 11:35 - Cindy L: Really?
11/21/15, 11:35 - Cindy L: Then nobody knows they are part of uol
11/21/15, 11:36 - Cindy L: More like I've only seen 2 ppl from qm
11/21/15, 11:36 - Cindy L: And they were like kinda embarrassed to say they were from QM, dunno wjy
11/21/15, 11:36 - Cindy L: Why
11/21/15, 11:37 - Cindy L: Ucl...
11/21/15, 11:37 - Cindy L: All I know is that if u can't do maths u go there for engineering
11/21/15, 11:38 - Mom: so can u do maths?
11/21/15, 11:38 - Cindy L: Saaaa~
11/21/15, 11:38 - Cindy L: I'm only going for design eng
11/21/15, 11:38 - Cindy L: It's half drawing
11/21/15, 11:39 - Mom: why?
11/21/15, 11:39 - Cindy L: And electronics and robotics
11/21/15, 11:39 - Cindy L: Oh there r drawing lessons u know?
11/21/15, 11:39 - Cindy L: My friend told me that
11/21/15, 11:39 - Mom: what abt material engrg/
11/21/15, 11:40 - Cindy L: What abt it?
11/21/15, 11:40 - Mom: ur not going to apply for it?
11/21/15, 11:40 - Mom: just design engrg?
11/21/15, 11:40 - Cindy L: I written most of the PS for tha
11/21/15, 11:41 - Cindy L: Kind of difficult to write for materials as well cuz basically the courses are quite different
11/21/15, 11:41 - Mom: wait a minute
11/21/15, 11:42 - Mom: what is meant by "saaaa~"?
11/21/15, 12:01 - Cindy L: Who knows
11/21/15, 12:01 - Cindy L: That's how you say it in jap
11/21/15, 12:03 - Mom: for a ps, don't be too specific on a particular subj cuz that wud limit ur offer possibilities, i think
11/21/15, 12:05 - Mom: btw design/materials/mechanical engrg all r connected, those degrees provide basic engrg k and skills for a student to do scientific research in order to enhance ppl's well beings, right?
11/21/15, 12:06 - Cindy L: Yeah but I can't write for just engineering
11/21/15, 12:06 - Cindy L: U hv to be more narrow than that
11/21/15, 12:08 - Mom: then u wud limit ur offer chance
11/21/15, 12:09 - Mom: remember ur experience in applying for ppe?
11/21/15, 12:10 - Cindy L: Yes and I got into lse cuz it was a perfect math
11/21/15, 12:10 - Cindy L: Match
11/21/15, 12:11 - Mom: not bc ur the party girl?
11/21/15, 12:11 - Cindy L: ....
11/21/15, 12:11 - Cindy L: U realise they don't take a certain type of ppl
11/21/15, 12:12 - Cindy L: As I have been making the case for in the last half an hr
11/21/15, 12:12 - Cindy L: But whatever
11/21/15, 12:26 - Mom: just joking üòö
11/21/15, 12:27 - Cindy L: That was quite the delayed response

11/22/15, 20:31 - Cindy L: Hey
11/22/15, 20:32 - Cindy L: I hv a question are traditional engineers not very involved in the design process?
11/22/15, 20:32 - Mom: no
11/22/15, 20:33 - Cindy L: It see
11/22/15, 20:33 - Cindy L: Thats why they keep focusing on talking abt how u hv the tools to make ur design
11/22/15, 20:33 - Cindy L: And bring a product from design to retail
11/22/15, 20:34 - Mom: I think u hv misunderstood my answer
11/22/15, 20:34 - Cindy L: Hmm why?
11/22/15, 20:35 - Mom: design works is one of the job for even a traditional engr
11/22/15, 20:36 - Mom: in fact, this course is just like pie
11/22/15, 20:36 - Cindy L: Pie?
11/22/15, 20:36 - Mom: product & industral engrg
11/22/15, 20:36 - Cindy L: Ah yes
11/22/15, 20:37 - Cindy L: But who cares its at imperial and I wanted to do that stuff in the first place
11/22/15, 20:37 - Mom: ok
11/22/15, 20:39 - Cindy L: <Media omitted>
11/22/15, 20:39 - Cindy L: Is this possible?
11/22/15, 20:41 - Mom: what is it? can't see
11/22/15, 20:43 - Cindy L: It says Robert used to be a doctor before he switched to engineering
11/22/15, 20:44 - Mom: u mean dr gave up the dr's job and switch to be an enge
11/22/15, 20:44 - Mom: engr
11/22/15, 20:44 - Mom: ?
11/22/15, 20:44 - Cindy L: Yes
11/22/15, 20:45 - Mom: i only heard dr switches to ba an artist, never heard of switching to be an engr
11/22/15, 20:45 - Cindy L: Well now u hv
11/22/15, 20:46 - Mom: where?
11/22/15, 20:46 - Mom: in ic?
11/22/15, 20:46 - Cindy L: On that website from imperial
11/22/15, 20:46 - Mom: err...
11/22/15, 20:47 - Mom: i only heard of engr switched to a&f, audit
11/22/15, 20:50 - Cindy L: yeah i know
11/22/15, 20:50 - Cindy L: u said
11/22/15, 20:51 - Mom: that's true
11/22/15, 20:51 - Mom: b4 when we did interview with the auditing firms at graduation
11/22/15, 20:52 - Mom: but anyway, ppl do hv their reasons for switching careers
11/22/15, 20:53 - Cindy L: yah
11/22/15, 20:56 - Cindy L: why are design engineers in demand?
11/22/15, 20:57 - Cindy L: wouldn't like a mechanical engineer suffice?
11/22/15, 20:57 - Cindy L: if u say they can design products as well?
11/22/15, 20:57 - Cindy L: is it because they don't know how to prototype?
11/22/15, 20:59 - Mom: the design engrg course is actually a pie course, that's different from mech engrg
11/22/15, 21:00 - Mom: ppl doing mech engrg don't go to pie
11/22/15, 21:00 - Mom: they'll find jobs in mech area where jobs r different and maybe with different pay scales
11/22/15, 21:01 - Mom: like civil and mech, they're different areas
11/22/15, 21:36 - Cindy L: noo
11/22/15, 21:36 - Cindy L: my friend's dad was a mechanical engineer
11/22/15, 21:36 - Cindy L: and he works in a toy company
11/22/15, 21:37 - Mom: he can, but they usually won't
11/22/15, 21:37 - Cindy L: rite
11/22/15, 21:37 - Cindy L: what's considered to be a pie area then?
11/22/15, 21:38 - Cindy L: cuz it seems like to me that they are focused on robotics and devices, start-up based products that sort of stuff
11/22/15, 21:38 - Cindy L: ah consumer products
11/22/15, 21:38 - Cindy L: thats the word
11/22/15, 21:38 - Cindy L: i was looking for
11/22/15, 21:39 - Mom: well, pie r for consumer products
11/22/15, 21:39 - Cindy L: yes i figured it out
11/22/15, 21:39 - Cindy L: i see
11/22/15, 21:39 - Cindy L: yeah it makes sense now
11/22/15, 21:40 - Cindy L: so civil, electrical and mech don't do consumer products?
11/22/15, 21:40 - Cindy L: thats why its so enterprise focused
11/22/15, 21:40 - Cindy L: cuz start ups usually sell consumer products
11/22/15, 21:40 - Mom: civil do framework of a building
11/22/15, 21:41 - Mom: electrical for power plant
11/22/15, 21:41 - Mom: mech for large machines
11/22/15, 21:41 - Mom: pie for small products, usually
11/22/15, 21:42 - Cindy L: ah thats why robots
11/22/15, 21:42 - Mom: robots r current product
11/22/15, 21:42 - Cindy L: yeah but there's a unit on robotics
11/22/15, 21:42 - Cindy L: and mechatronics
11/22/15, 21:42 - Mom: in the future, maybe other
11/22/15, 21:42 - Cindy L: and electronics
11/22/15, 21:43 - Cindy L: so ofc i'm gonna say i wanna build robots.
11/22/15, 21:43 - Mom: kind of
11/22/15, 21:43 - Cindy L: i want sensor lights which can actually sense that there is a person in the bathroom
11/22/15, 21:43 - Cindy L: so i don't have to sit in the dark iwth my pants down
11/22/15, 21:45 - Mom: that's ur new product?
11/22/15, 21:45 - Cindy L: i swear the lights in the corridor and the toilet and kitchen are on to something
11/22/15, 21:45 - Cindy L: they never sense my presence
11/22/15, 21:45 - Mom: too bad
11/22/15, 21:46 - Mom: how abt keep on raving ur hands and feet when ur sitting in the toilet?
11/22/15, 21:47 - Cindy L: thats what i literally have to do
11/22/15, 21:47 - Cindy L: and then i fall into the bowl
11/22/15, 21:47 - Mom: rlly, fell into the bowl?
11/22/15, 21:47 - Cindy L: hahahaha
11/22/15, 21:48 - Cindy L: thats why the world needs better sensor lights
11/22/15, 21:49 - Mom: that's what the course aims to do, to hv innovative thingy and to improve ppl's well being
11/22/15, 21:51 - Mom: i think the present design engrg course is different from traditional pie in that it places more emphasize on innovation & design in the beginning instead of just production process in the traditional pie course
11/22/15, 21:51 - Cindy L: ok thats great
11/22/15, 21:51 - Cindy L: cuz i also want to make my VR first person shooter
11/22/15, 21:51 - Cindy L: like 3d call of duty
11/22/15, 21:51 - Cindy L: :D
11/22/15, 21:52 - Cindy L: and i'll be rich :D))
11/22/15, 21:52 - Cindy L: (that's the double chin smiley)
11/22/15, 21:53 - Mom: only if u can register for patents timely, otherwise somebody will steal ur idea
11/22/15, 21:53 - Cindy L: google already invented vr
11/22/15, 21:53 - Mom: like the lollipop ice stick
11/22/15, 21:53 - Cindy L: all u can do is make the game.
11/22/15, 21:53 - Cindy L: and sell it

11/22/15, 21:55 - Cindy L: too bad the market does not encourage r&d
11/22/15, 21:55 - Mom: and so many perks
11/22/15, 21:55 - Cindy L: i'm sure they have good health insurance
11/22/15, 21:55 - Mom: this is very important in usa
11/22/15, 21:55 - Cindy L: yes what if u got shot
11/22/15, 21:56 - Mom: then no medicine lah

11/22/15, 22:05 - Cindy L: i'm sitting
11/22/15, 22:05 - Cindy L: and i can only open my left eye
11/22/15, 22:05 - Cindy L: my right has dropped so much i literally hv it closed
11/22/15, 22:06 - Mom: so its ur right-side body shake?
11/22/15, 22:06 - Cindy L: no whole body
11/22/15, 22:06 - Cindy L: i think it maybe a food
11/22/15, 22:06 - Cindy L: cuz i only starts geeting these just now
11/22/15, 22:07 - Mom: but the scenario u talked abt ur right eye drooping sound like mg
11/22/15, 22:07 - Cindy L: i'ts not
11/22/15, 22:07 - Mom: how long the shaking last/
11/22/15, 22:07 - Cindy L: i've checked mg
11/22/15, 22:07 - Cindy L: like a few seconds
11/22/15, 22:07 - Mom: just once or what?
11/22/15, 22:07 - Cindy L: a few times
11/22/15, 22:07 - Cindy L: i keeps coming
11/22/15, 22:07 - Cindy L: in waves
11/22/15, 22:08 - Mom: only after eating japchae?
11/22/15, 22:08 - Cindy L: yah
11/22/15, 22:09 - Mom: and no incidents b4 eating japchae?
11/22/15, 22:13 - Mom: hv u taken any drugs?
11/22/15, 22:13 - Cindy L: Noo
11/22/15, 22:14 - Mom: can u feel painful sensation on nerves? or simple body movements?
11/22/15, 22:15 - Cindy L: no
11/22/15, 22:15 - Cindy L: i probably 1. ate too much
11/22/15, 22:15 - Cindy L: or 2. allergic to sesame oil
11/22/15, 22:15 - Cindy L: or the vermicelli
11/22/15, 22:15 - Mom: 1 doesn't sound reasonable
11/22/15, 22:16 - Cindy L: oh it might be
11/22/15, 22:16 - Cindy L: my friend's dog
11/22/15, 22:16 - Mom: 2 first time to eat sesame oil?
11/22/15, 22:16 - Cindy L: gets seizures when it eats too much
11/22/15, 22:16 - Mom: will it happen just in a dog?
11/22/15, 22:16 - Cindy L: and a lot of hormones are produced in the gut
11/22/15, 22:16 - Cindy L: i don't think so
11/22/15, 22:17 - Cindy L: an clinical trials are usually done on animals
11/22/15, 22:17 - Cindy L: like all narco research is done using mice and dogs
11/22/15, 22:17 - Mom: 1. y eat so much?
11/22/15, 22:17 - Cindy L: i just cooked what was left
11/22/15, 22:17 - Cindy L: and i didn't eat that much
11/22/15, 22:17 - Cindy L: but when i put it on the place it did look quite a lot
11/22/15, 22:17 - Mom: 2. i told u to eat slowly to reduce the eating quantity ma
11/22/15, 22:18 - Cindy L: or its the oil
11/22/15, 22:18 - Cindy L: cuz usually i don't cook with that much oil
11/22/15, 22:18 - Mom: i told to eat slowly cuz u eat slowly u feel the fullness in the stomach soon
11/22/15, 22:19 - Cindy L: yea yeah
11/22/15, 22:19 - Cindy L: we're not discussing how i should eat
11/22/15, 22:19 - Mom: oil might be a reason to make u full
11/22/15, 22:19 - Cindy L: we're discussing what caused the mini seizures
11/22/15, 22:19 - Cindy L: but i had a lot of pizza and that didn't cause seizures
11/22/15, 22:19 - Mom: how can we know? that's quite alot of variable here
11/22/15, 22:20 - Mom: eat slowly and don't over-eat lah
11/22/15, 22:20 - Cindy L: i can say it definitely had to do with the japchae
11/22/15, 22:20 - Mom: üôèüôè
11/22/15, 22:20 - Cindy L: cuz i haven't had japchae for a long time
11/22/15, 22:20 - Cindy L: but can it been just ate too much?
11/22/15, 22:20 - Mom: but that's not the first time u eat japchae ma
11/22/15, 22:20 - Cindy L: then the times we did korean grill i should have seizures.
11/22/15, 22:20 - Cindy L: but i didn't
11/22/15, 22:21 - Cindy L: yeah but i didn't experience anything for the past few days
11/22/15, 22:21 - Mom: what other ingredients in ur japchae?
11/22/15, 22:21 - Cindy L: until after the japchae
11/22/15, 22:21 - Cindy L: er
11/22/15, 22:22 - Mom: and is there any different on ur food/daily schedule/activities that cause this seizures?
11/22/15, 22:22 - Cindy L: onion, garlic, spinach, brown cap mushroom, carrots, ground beef, soy sauce, sesame oil, chilli pepper flakes
11/22/15, 22:22 - Cindy L: noodles
11/22/15, 22:22 - Cindy L: no
11/22/15, 22:23 - Mom: also is ur face vibrating when ur right eye is drooping?
11/22/15, 22:23 - Cindy L: i just had dinner
11/22/15, 22:23 - Cindy L: yes
11/22/15, 22:23 - Cindy L: no its ike paralysed
11/22/15, 22:24 - Mom: u mean ur face muscle is relaxed?
11/22/15, 22:25 - Cindy L: yes
11/22/15, 22:25 - Mom: how long u had the first time shaking after eating ur japchae?
11/22/15, 22:25 - Cindy L: like
11/22/15, 22:25 - Cindy L: around
11/22/15, 22:25 - Cindy L: 30 mins?
11/22/15, 22:26 - Mom: then it sounds food is probably the reason for ur shaking
11/22/15, 22:26 - Mom: bc its almost the time to go into ur stomach
11/22/15, 22:26 - Cindy L: yes like i said
11/22/15, 22:27 - Mom: which one of the ingredients is new to ur food this time?
11/22/15, 22:27 - Mom: or the mixture?
11/22/15, 22:27 - Cindy L: none
11/22/15, 22:27 - Cindy L: i use leftovers
11/22/15, 22:28 - Mom: cuz there may not be the ingredient itself, maybe a result of the mixture that cuz different reaction
11/22/15, 22:28 - Mom: how long the leftovers?
11/22/15, 22:28 - Cindy L: the beef was from yesterday
11/22/15, 22:28 - Mom: and how long u keep the mushroom?
11/22/15, 22:29 - Cindy L: i only bought like 2 days ago
11/22/15, 22:29 - Mom: beef ok
11/22/15, 22:29 - Cindy L: the ground beef did say that u should use within 24 hrs
11/22/15, 22:29 - Cindy L: but it didn't smell weird
11/22/15, 22:29 - Cindy L: and it tasted the same
11/22/15, 22:30 - Cindy L: the noodles?
11/22/15, 22:30 - Mom: beef: did u buy at a great bargain?
11/22/15, 22:30 - Cindy L: no
11/22/15, 22:30 - Cindy L: it was sainsbury
11/22/15, 22:30 - Mom: then beef ok
11/22/15, 22:30 - Cindy L: and i had it for 2 meals yesterday
11/22/15, 22:31 - Mom: what kind of noodle is it?
11/22/15, 22:31 - Cindy L: the korean sweet potato one
11/22/15, 22:31 - Cindy L: i bought at the korean shop
11/22/15, 22:32 - Mom: other than japchae, what else did u eat or drink?
11/22/15, 22:32 - Cindy L: tea
11/22/15, 22:32 - Cindy L: orange juice
11/22/15, 22:32 - Cindy L: but i always have orange juice
11/22/15, 22:32 - Mom: is the shaking all over?
11/22/15, 22:32 - Cindy L: yes
11/22/15, 22:32 - Cindy L: its like the ones i typically have at six
11/22/15, 22:33 - Mom: also hv shaking at six?
11/22/15, 22:34 - Cindy L: no
11/22/15, 22:34 - Cindy L: and i napped three time today
11/22/15, 22:34 - Cindy L: so theoretically i shouldn't have had that seizure
11/22/15, 22:35 - Mom: did u sleep after that seizure?
11/22/15, 22:35 - Cindy L: no
11/22/15, 22:35 - Mom: not even feel sleepy?
11/22/15, 22:35 - Cindy L: hmmm no
11/22/15, 22:36 - Cindy L: i wasn't exactly a full seizure
11/22/15, 22:36 - Cindy L: just the sensations are similar
11/22/15, 22:36 - Cindy L: if it helps you to understand
11/22/15, 22:36 - Mom: it sounds that ur body tells u to hv some rest after that dinner, i think
11/22/15, 22:36 - Cindy L: no but 1. i already had 3 naps today
11/22/15, 22:36 - Cindy L: so it should not have had one
11/22/15, 22:36 - Cindy L: 2. i don't usually sleep after dinner
11/22/15, 22:37 - Cindy L: 3. i wasn't even feeling tired
11/22/15, 22:37 - Mom: u don't feel sleepy after eating?
11/22/15, 22:37 - Cindy L: no
11/22/15, 22:38 - Mom: is it like the scenario after eating at san-yeung?
11/22/15, 22:38 - Cindy L: no
11/22/15, 22:38 - Cindy L: just mini ones
11/22/15, 22:38 - Cindy L: probably restricted to head area
11/22/15, 22:38 - Cindy L: cuz i can type and use laptop
11/22/15, 22:39 - Mom: but u just said ur whole body was shaking?
11/22/15, 22:40 - Mom: how long @ of ur 3 naps last for?
11/22/15, 22:40 - Mom: 30 mins or an hr?
11/22/15, 22:45 - Cindy L: huh
11/22/15, 22:45 - Cindy L: erm
11/22/15, 22:45 - Cindy L: well i had them throughout the afternoon from 2 to 5
11/22/15, 22:45 - Cindy L: about 30-40 mins each i would say
11/22/15, 22:45 - Cindy L: anyways
11/22/15, 22:45 - Cindy L: 3 naps is suffice
11/22/15, 22:46 - Cindy L: usually i don't even get 3 naps a day of 30mins
11/22/15, 22:46 - Cindy L: i only take one or two
11/22/15, 22:46 - Cindy L: and they are enough to last me the whole day.
11/22/15, 22:46 - Cindy L: so its definitely not an issue of fatigue
11/22/15, 22:58 - Cindy L: I already answered u
11/22/15, 22:58 - Cindy L: Abt 30-40 mins each
11/22/15, 22:59 - Cindy L: Though I did drink a lot of water today
11/22/15, 22:59 - Cindy L: Like a lot
11/22/15, 22:59 - Cindy L: More than usual
11/22/15, 23:02 - Mom: hmm..
11/22/15, 23:45 - Mom: well u say no r&d in pie cuz revenue generated from consumer products is not big enough to support hugh r&d fund demand
11/22/15, 23:46 - Cindy L: noooo
11/22/15, 23:46 - Cindy L: that's not the case
11/22/15, 23:46 - Cindy L: wait....
11/22/15, 23:46 - Cindy L: hmmm
11/22/15, 23:46 - Cindy L: its a very fast pace market
11/22/15, 23:47 - Cindy L: cuz what u invent
11/22/15, 23:47 - Mom: think abt the money put in med, infrastructure
11/22/15, 23:47 - Cindy L: ur product
11/22/15, 23:47 - Cindy L: will only be able to make money when it is unique
11/22/15, 23:47 - Cindy L: like iphones were in the beginning
11/22/15, 23:47 - Cindy L: once others see that there is profit
11/22/15, 23:47 - Cindy L: to be made
11/22/15, 23:48 - Mom: how big u think that lump of money?
11/22/15, 23:48 - Cindy L: they will develop similar products
11/22/15, 23:48 - Cindy L: and then it will move towards perfect competition
11/22/15, 23:48 - Cindy L: and then you won't make a lot
11/22/15, 23:49 - Cindy L: so u gotta move on before teh others join
11/22/15, 23:49 - Cindy L: it takes less money to invest in  producing consumer products
11/22/15, 23:50 - Cindy L: because they are usually cobblered together out of existing tech
11/22/15, 23:50 - Cindy L: there's no actual invent
11/22/15, 23:50 - Cindy L: invention
11/22/15, 23:51 - Cindy L: its more like a group of people have an idea abt making some new out of existing stuff lying around
11/22/15, 23:51 - Cindy L: and then they create a start up
11/22/15, 23:51 - Mom: exactly
11/22/15, 23:51 - Cindy L: start ups are short lived
11/22/15, 23:51 - Mom: just fine tune of existing product
11/22/15, 23:51 - Cindy L: omg my econ is working
11/22/15, 23:52 - Mom: if u want to live on start ups, ur going to grow thin
11/22/15, 23:52 - Cindy L: nnooo but design engineers are needed in a lot of industries
11/22/15, 23:52 - Cindy L: it's not just start ups
11/22/15, 23:52 - Cindy L: like start ups are a possible option
11/22/15, 23:53 - Cindy L: and anyways imperial says u can get chartered as mech eng
11/22/15, 23:53 - Mom: design engr used to do system design in practice
11/22/15, 23:53 - Cindy L: ?
11/22/15, 23:53 - Cindy L: sorry don't understand
11/22/15, 23:53 - Mom: fine tune systems
11/22/15, 23:54 - Mom: method of doing things
11/22/15, 23:54 - Cindy L: its not
11/22/15, 23:54 - Cindy L: design engineer basically does prototyping
11/22/15, 23:55 - Mom: u know they also do system design?
11/22/15, 23:55 - Cindy L: well fine yeah fine tuning things
11/22/15, 23:55 - Cindy L: don't worry
11/22/15, 23:55 - Cindy L: u can still go into ibank if u go to imperial
11/22/15, 23:55 - Mom: why wud i worry?
11/22/15, 23:56 - Mom: u can go anywhere with ic degree, i think
11/22/15, 23:56 - Cindy L: although i don't really have interest in banking....
11/22/15, 23:56 - Cindy L: well a guy from ucl said if u don't know what you want to do u should do engineering.
11/22/15, 23:56 - Cindy L: and he's phd
11/22/15, 23:56 - Mom: i think u got it mixed up, banking is different from ibanking
11/22/15, 23:56 - Cindy L: so that advice must be worth something
11/22/15, 23:57 - Cindy L: dude i just don't have an interest in finance
11/22/15, 23:57 - Mom: that's y he's in phd
11/22/15, 23:57 - Cindy L: erm ppl get phds cuz they're smart?
11/22/15, 23:57 - Mom: bc he doesn't even have a clear understanding of himself and the world outside
11/22/15, 23:57 - Cindy L: well fine.
11/22/15, 23:57 - Cindy L: whatever

11/26/15, 12:20 - Cindy L: Anyways that reminds me of a bill gates quote

11/26/15, 12:23 - Mom: what abt bio-medical sci? that's always demand for that
11/26/15, 12:23 - Cindy L: So u can find out what people like or want or behave
11/26/15, 12:24 - Mom: machines? don't u worry that those machines will replace a human being's work some days later?
11/26/15, 12:24 - Cindy L: It's kind of in the region of ai development and comp sci
11/26/15, 12:24 - Cindy L: Hmm yea tru
11/26/15, 12:25 - Cindy L: But that means u hv more time to do other things if machines do all the work lol
11/26/15, 12:25 - Cindy L: No srsly I think machines will rlly replace white collar work soon
11/26/15, 12:26 - Cindy L: Cuz they can learn to do stuff by analysing data
11/26/15, 12:26 - Mom: but that means a hugh amount of idle human resources in the world, that ppl wud bring destrucitons everywhere
11/26/15, 12:26 - Cindy L: We don't even need to teach them
11/26/15, 12:26 - Cindy L: Like self driving cars

11/26/15, 12:28 - Cindy L: Did u know the entertainment industry is the one which is least likely to be replaced by machines?
11/26/15, 12:29 - Cindy L: Haha I guess machines can't make films yet
11/26/15, 12:29 - Mom: so everybody rushes into entertainment industry, like in korea?
11/26/15, 12:29 - Cindy L: Hmm maybe

11/26/15, 12:33 - Cindy L: And I like the self service counters in Saintsbury
11/26/15, 12:33 - Cindy L: So no harm done
11/26/15, 12:34 - Cindy L: Man the best thing in London apart from next day delivery is probably the self service machines

11/26/15, 12:38 - Mom: it's not fresh as u can see from its colour, other than the brown bit, the area surrounding is turning pale, this means the beef not fresh
11/26/15, 12:38 - Mom: if the beef is fresh, its colour shud be deep red
11/26/15, 12:38 - Cindy L: Yea

11/26/15, 13:12 - Cindy L: Which many of them find surprising
11/26/15, 13:12 - Mom: yea 75% of lse student got 2:1
11/26/15, 13:13 - Cindy L: So I really hv no idea how Adam failed 1st yr...
11/26/15, 13:14 - Mom: perhaps he didn't attend classes and was refrained from taking exam
11/26/15, 13:15 - Cindy L: Yeah maybe
11/26/15, 13:15 - Cindy L: He said he didn't write anything
11/26/15, 13:15 - Cindy L: Lol cuz he's emotionally screwed up as well
11/26/15, 13:16 - Mom: what kind of person is he? how he got in lse?
11/26/15, 13:18 - Cindy L: Huh he got good a level grades

11/26/15, 13:25 - Mom: that's how he got ptsd?
11/26/15, 13:25 - Cindy L: He has she'll shock apparently
11/26/15, 13:25 - Cindy L: Shell shock
11/26/15, 13:25 - Cindy L: It's when u hear loud noises and think it's bombs

11/26/15, 13:26 - Cindy L: Saaaa ~
11/26/15, 13:26 - Cindy L: I dunno
11/26/15, 13:26 - Mom: what did he see?
11/26/15, 13:27 - Cindy L: The other guy said it was like 2 yrs of summer camp
11/26/15, 13:27 - Cindy L: It's like regular military training
11/26/15, 13:27 - Cindy L: U don't hv to actually kill ppl
11/26/15, 13:28 - Cindy L: But then he just finished it
11/26/15, 13:28 - Cindy L: The other guy is already there third yr
11/26/15, 13:28 - Cindy L: And technically PTSD just means u can't adjust to the new society
11/26/15, 13:28 - Cindy L: So by definition I could hv ib PTSD
11/26/15, 13:29 - Mom: is he on psycho med?
11/26/15, 13:29 - Cindy L: No
11/26/15, 13:29 - Mom: ib ptsd?
11/26/15, 13:29 - Cindy L: Nah I don't think it's that serious
11/26/15, 13:29 - Mom: hahaha, ur so funny
11/26/15, 13:29 - Cindy L: Hahaha yes machines can never replace me
11/26/15, 13:30 - Cindy L: He knew abt all the drugs I told him though
11/26/15, 13:30 - Cindy L: Cuz he also has a narcoleptic friend
11/26/15, 13:30 - Mom: did he try?
11/26/15, 13:31 - Cindy L: What modafinil
11/26/15, 13:31 - Cindy L: No u only take if u are narc
11/26/15, 13:31 - Cindy L: U know ritalin and adderall are smart drugs though
11/26/15, 13:31 - Mom: some ppl take them as smart drug
11/26/15, 13:31 - Cindy L: Yes
11/26/15, 13:32 - Cindy L: He agrees that ritalin fuxks ppl up
11/26/15, 13:32 - Cindy L: So I guess that's common knowledge
11/26/15, 13:33 - Mom: it's obvious, research shows ritalin no good, only drs ignore the warning
11/26/15, 13:33 - Cindy L: Yeah
11/26/15, 13:34 - Cindy L: He says modafinil is much gentler
11/26/15, 13:34 - Mom: hahahaha
11/26/15, 13:34 - Cindy L: But I guess the only way for me to get modafinil is if I did the sleep tests all over again at nhs
11/26/15, 13:35 - Cindy L: üò≠
11/26/15, 13:35 - Mom: did he actually try modafinil himself?

11/26/15, 13:45 - Cindy L: He and his friends trash the place every friday
11/26/15, 13:46 - Mom: no complaints from flatmates?
11/26/15, 13:46 - Mom: or from the dorm person?
11/26/15, 13:47 - Cindy L: Can't rlly complain cuz we gotta live with them
11/26/15, 13:47 - Cindy L: They complained abt his pans in the sink though
11/26/15, 13:47 - Cindy L: Lol
11/26/15, 13:47 - Cindy L: Did I show u the photo of the alcohol bottles
11/26/15, 13:48 - Cindy L: It actually looks pretty cool, they look like trophies or something
11/26/15, 13:48 - Mom: yea
11/26/15, 13:48 - Mom: i mean the janitor of the highborn hall?
11/26/15, 13:49 - Cindy L: What abt the janitor?
11/26/15, 13:49 - Mom: who did the cleaning afterwards? themselves or the janitor?
11/26/15, 13:49 - Cindy L: The cleaner comes in
11/26/15, 13:49 - Cindy L: And they kind of just push everything to the side next morning
11/26/15, 13:50 - Cindy L: Thank god I don't hv to use their kitchen
11/26/15, 13:50 - Mom: wow, if that happens in hk, the cleaner wud def complaints a lot bc they hv to do extra work
11/26/15, 13:51 - Cindy L: Can't they employ and exploit immigrants here
11/26/15, 13:51 - Cindy L: The cleaner only speaks spanish
11/26/15, 13:52 - Mom: perhaps the cleaners r complaining but ppl just don't understand spanish
11/26/15, 13:52 - Cindy L: Maybe
11/26/15, 13:52 - Cindy L: Sometimes they just don't clean it
11/26/15, 13:53 - Mom: so sad, spanish becomes the down-under language
11/26/15, 13:53 - Cindy L: It actually says that if u clear the surface and they can't clean they just don't clean it
11/26/15, 13:53 - Cindy L: Ikr
11/26/15, 13:53 - Cindy L: Should done germab
11/26/15, 13:53 - Cindy L: German
11/26/15, 13:53 - Mom: yea
11/26/15, 13:54 - Cindy L: U know Berlin is the European silicon valley
11/26/15, 13:54 - Cindy L: So many start ups here
11/26/15, 13:54 - Cindy L: There
11/26/15, 13:54 - Mom: want to learn german now?
11/26/15, 13:55 - Cindy L: And Finland actually manufactures and designs a lot of consumer devices
11/26/15, 13:55 - Cindy L: So u don't need to go to China
11/26/15, 13:55 - Cindy L: Anyways I think Chinese products here are actually, dare I say, good
11/26/15, 13:56 - Cindy L: Cuz I see a lot of huawei and byd cars around
11/26/15, 13:56 - Cindy L: So its true that Chinese ppl export the best
11/26/15, 13:56 - Mom: what? good?
11/26/15, 13:56 - Cindy L: And keep the worst
11/26/15, 13:56 - Cindy L: Compared to the Chinese stuff we're uses to , yeah they are better here
11/26/15, 13:57 - Cindy L: Cuz there r cheaper places to start sweat shops
11/26/15, 13:57 - Cindy L: Like Africa
11/26/15, 13:57 - Cindy L: And they r closer
11/26/15, 13:58 - Cindy L: Dude this kind of stuff is what I thought econ was gonna be abt
11/26/15, 13:58 - Mom: china is practising dumping technique in international trades now
11/26/15, 13:59 - Cindy L: And turns out it's just graphs graphs and more graphs
11/26/15, 13:59 - Mom: they aim to increase their market share in the world
11/26/15, 13:59 - Cindy L: I know this
11/26/15, 13:59 - Cindy L: Then u lower price to undercut other sellers
11/26/15, 14:00 - Cindy L: To corner the market
11/26/15, 14:00 - Cindy L: And create a monopoly
11/26/15, 14:00 - Mom: as long as they get their firm market share, prices will increase sharply like the tactics played in hk\
11/26/15, 14:00 - Cindy L: Hahahahaha
11/26/15, 14:00 - Cindy L: Yeah but its not that easy to dominate global trade
11/26/15, 14:01 - Cindy L: In HK yeah, cuz their influence is big
11/26/15, 14:01 - Cindy L: Immense
11/26/15, 14:01 - Mom: not to dominate but to stay firm their position
11/26/15, 14:01 - Cindy L: Kay
11/26/15, 14:01 - Cindy L: I really don't care that much nowadays.
11/26/15, 14:01 - Cindy L: As long as I don't hv to work there I'm good.
11/26/15, 14:02 - Cindy L: Anyways its mostly apple here again
11/26/15, 14:02 - Mom: don't worry, u don't hv a share bc they hv may mainlander still unable to find a job in mainland china
11/26/15, 14:02 - Cindy L: Yeah
11/26/15, 14:03 - Cindy L: Cuz more and more uni grads
11/26/15, 14:03 - Cindy L: Not enough white collar jobs
11/26/15, 14:03 - Cindy L: China's service sector isn't that big yet
11/26/15, 14:03 - Mom: tbh, american products are better in quality compared to those made in china
11/26/15, 14:04 - Cindy L: But if u think abt it
11/26/15, 14:04 - Mom: the point is china has too many population
11/26/15, 14:04 - Cindy L: Quite impressive that they modernize not even 100 yrs ago
11/26/15, 14:04 - Cindy L: Before that 90% population were farmers...
11/26/15, 14:05 - Mom: wow, u sounds like defending for china
11/26/15, 14:05 - Cindy L: Just objective analysis
11/26/15, 14:05 - Cindy L: I mean 6 million ppl did starve to death
11/26/15, 14:06 - Cindy L: Anyways u can learn a lot from things you hate.
11/26/15, 14:07 - Cindy L: Like the guy in econ who annoys the shit out of me.
11/26/15, 14:07 - Cindy L: Okay so I'm not too bad at econ
11/26/15, 14:08 - Cindy L: I always find anything with marginal in front of it confusing
11/26/15, 14:09 - Mom: what marginal in front of it confusing?
11/26/15, 14:09 - Cindy L: Like marginal cost
11/26/15, 14:09 - Cindy L: And marginal product
11/26/15, 14:09 - Mom: u mean u don't understand these concepts?
11/26/15, 14:09 - Cindy L: And marginal benedit
11/26/15, 14:09 - Cindy L: Like I get it if I look at the definition in words
11/26/15, 14:10 - Mom: marginal = incremental/difference
11/26/15, 14:10 - Cindy L: Yeah
11/26/15, 14:10 - Cindy L: So derivative
11/26/15, 14:10 - Mom: derivatives r product derived from orignal one
11/26/15, 14:11 - Cindy L: And she uses a lot of them really quickly in class
11/26/15, 14:11 - Cindy L: Like mp is equivalent to mc and mrp and because of this we hv irs
11/26/15, 14:11 - Cindy L: Those abbreviations confused the fuck out of me the first time..
11/26/15, 14:12 - Mom: just read ur textbook
11/26/15, 14:12 - Cindy L: Yeah
11/26/15, 14:12 - Cindy L: And also the idea that
11/26/15, 14:12 - Mom: u know the abbr
11/26/15, 14:12 - Cindy L: Producers chose the quantity and not the price
11/26/15, 14:12 - Cindy L: Lol
11/26/15, 14:13 - Cindy L: That's is just funny stuff
11/26/15, 14:13 - Mom: ofc la
11/26/15, 14:13 - Mom: produce only can control the quantity not the price of product
11/26/15, 14:13 - Cindy L: So do firms choose the price?
11/26/15, 14:13 - Cindy L: But firms choose the quantity to sell as well
11/26/15, 14:13 - Mom: firms choose to maximize profits
11/26/15, 14:14 - Cindy L: So in fact nobody is in control of the prices
11/26/15, 14:14 - Cindy L: U don't decide how much to sell a product at
11/26/15, 14:14 - Cindy L: Omg.
11/26/15, 14:14 - Mom: we shall hv to wait for consumers' behaviour
11/26/15, 14:15 - Cindy L: But in reality I can choose to sell my stuff at whatever price I want
11/26/15, 14:15 - Mom: no if consumers don't like ur product so much, then u can't set the price high
11/26/15, 14:15 - Cindy L: It is more intuitive to understand that firms price their products at particular prices
11/26/15, 14:16 - Cindy L: So does that mean
11/26/15, 14:16 - Mom: no
11/26/15, 14:16 - Cindy L: U don't hv a choice of how much to sell ur house for
11/26/15, 14:17 - Cindy L: Ah wait that makes sense
11/26/15, 14:17 - Cindy L: U can only sell at a time where u can maximize ur profit
11/26/15, 14:17 - Mom: firms will do market research b4 product being actually launched into the market
11/26/15, 14:17 - Cindy L: I see so this is part of market research
11/26/15, 14:18 - Mom: exactly
11/26/15, 14:18 - Cindy L: I was thinking my yr of econ might be appreciated by the design engineering faculty.
11/26/15, 14:19 - Cindy L: Cuz they hv that commercial aspect
11/26/15, 14:19 - Mom: to do mini enterprise, u need business knowledge
11/26/15, 14:19 - Mom: econ, a&f, law are plus
11/26/15, 14:20 - Cindy L: Yeah ofc
11/26/15, 14:20 - Cindy L: But business is part of the course
11/26/15, 14:21 - Mom: its just minor thing, engrg knowledge is the main point
11/26/15, 14:21 - Cindy L: Well if they ask at least I hv some relevance
11/26/15, 14:21 - Cindy L: Ofc
11/26/15, 14:22 - Mom: engrg is the main point, i don't think a yr at econ will be that much advantageous
11/26/15, 14:22 - Cindy L: Crap at least they know I've been doing math
11/26/15, 14:22 - Cindy L: So I shouldn't tell them
11/26/15, 14:23 - Cindy L: I'm still deliberating whether to say or not
11/26/15, 14:23 - Mom: only if u hv the requisite ib scores and passion abt engrg, that's enough
11/26/15, 14:24 - Cindy L: Well I hope that's what they think
11/26/15, 14:24 - Mom: ur maths is different from engrg maths
11/26/15, 14:24 - Cindy L: Erm I do calx
11/26/15, 14:24 - Cindy L: Calc
11/26/15, 14:24 - Cindy L: I'm doing some sort of math
11/26/15, 14:24 - Mom: engrg guys r pretty straight forward
11/26/15, 14:25 - Mom: they pick the one who likes the subj, i believe
11/26/15, 14:25 - Mom: especially british r not interested in stem subj
11/26/15, 14:26 - Cindy L: Yeah I'm sort of bagging on
11/26/15, 14:26 - Cindy L: 1. Not enough girls in stem
11/26/15, 14:26 - Cindy L: 2. Not enough engineers in general
11/26/15, 14:26 - Cindy L: 3. Ib kid
11/26/15, 14:27 - Mom: ur so proud of being an ib kid!
11/26/15, 14:27 - Cindy L: They only accept ib internationals
11/26/15, 14:27 - Cindy L: And ofc
11/26/15, 14:27 - Mom: rlly?
11/26/15, 14:28 - Cindy L: Yh according to my friend in kc
11/26/15, 14:28 - Cindy L: Ic
11/26/15, 14:28 - Cindy L: And ib is worth like 500+ucas points
11/26/15, 14:28 - Cindy L: That's double a levels
11/26/15, 14:28 - Mom: how's she? does she like the course?
11/26/15, 14:28 - Cindy L: Huh she's super busy
11/26/15, 14:29 - Cindy L: Ive only met her once
11/26/15, 14:29 - Mom: even then, u don't hv advantage in ucl application
11/26/15, 14:29 - Cindy L: Y?
11/26/15, 14:29 - Mom: ib = 500+ ucas points
11/26/15, 14:30 - Cindy L: Ah u mean ppe
11/26/15, 14:30 - Cindy L: Yeah dunno what happened there
11/26/15, 14:30 - Cindy L: But I heard their poli sci is 15 hrs a week

1/3/16, 16:27 - Cindy L: And what happens in these development teams
1/3/16, 16:27 - Mom: well, i don't think ur dad rlly hates the job
1/3/16, 16:27 - Cindy L: Like frustrations
1/3/16, 16:28 - Mom: what he's having problem is abt the ppl around his team
1/3/16, 16:28 - Cindy L: With delivering work
1/3/16, 16:28 - Cindy L: Well he says engineering is not a good field
1/3/16, 16:30 - Mom: bc he has problem in dealing with ppl, he doesn't hv the proper power to do his own job
1/3/16, 16:30 - Mom: he's kind of frustrated
1/3/16, 16:30 - Cindy L: Yes

1/3/16, 16:31 - Mom: he's not a tech person
1/3/16, 16:31 - Cindy L: u wanna read it? it's like 38000 words.
1/3/16, 16:32 - Mom: don't ever try to convince him abt the tech change cuz he's in a retired mood now
1/3/16, 16:32 - Cindy L: hahaahaa

1/3/16, 16:32 - Cindy L: it's on forbes
1/3/16, 16:32 - Mom: how many pages r there?
1/3/16, 16:33 - Cindy L: ah sorry bloomberg
1/3/16, 16:33 - Cindy L: http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/
1/3/16, 16:33 - Mom: online?
1/3/16, 16:33 - Cindy L: yep
1/3/16, 16:33 - Mom: ok
1/3/16, 16:33 - Cindy L: there's a lot about coding though
1/3/16, 16:33 - Cindy L: but the management bits are pretty funny
1/3/16, 16:33 - Cindy L: imo
1/3/16, 16:34 - Mom: engineers r always bad at mangement
1/3/16, 16:34 - Mom: ur dad also hates accounting jobs
1/3/16, 16:35 - Cindy L: its more abt how an old manager deals with a tech team.
1/3/16, 16:35 - Cindy L: lol doesn't he hate everything
1/3/16, 16:35 - Mom: k
1/3/16, 16:35 - Mom: no, at least he adores doctors
1/4/16, 09:31 - Cindy L: So I've been playing tap tycoon for 3 days
1/4/16, 09:32 - Cindy L: I've noticed my net worth is probably less than the shit tons of money I poured into building my empire
1/4/16, 09:32 - Cindy L: Does that mean in the long run my investment is a loss?
1/4/16, 09:57 - Mom: i don't know what tap tycoon is?
1/4/16, 09:57 - Mom: is that stock investment game?
1/4/16, 11:34 - Cindy L: It's that dumb tapping game where u earn money by tapping and u can buy and upgrade companies with it
1/4/16, 11:35 - Mom: Heyyyyy
1/4/16, 11:36 - Cindy L: Hi
1/4/16, 11:36 - Cindy L: When did u start using heyy
1/4/16, 11:36 - Cindy L: That's like franny
1/4/16, 11:36 - Mom: Since I became emos
1/4/16, 11:36 - Cindy L: Rifht
1/4/16, 11:37 - Cindy L: I used the inhaler and I feel like I can breath again
1/4/16, 11:37 - Cindy L: üëç
1/4/16, 11:37 - Cindy L: #dontbeasmoker
1/4/16, 11:38 - Mom: how often u use that inhaler?
1/4/16, 11:42 - Mom: u said u can buy and upgrade those companies, that means u hv been using money from ur pool, then it's logical that ur liquid asset (cash, stocks, bonds) will be less than the beginning, and ur overall net worth (liquid asset + fixed assets) will be determined by the value of those fixed assets
1/4/16, 11:48 - Mom: those inhalers actually are steriod, that means ur still having inflammation at ur throat
1/4/16, 11:49 - Mom: i think u still have to take anti-inflammatory medicine
1/4/16, 11:52 - Mom: take that cough med which helps u clear ur inflammated stuff at throat
1/4/16, 11:53 - Cindy L: Ok
1/4/16, 11:54 - Cindy L: That's the ibuprofen right?
1/4/16, 11:54 - Cindy L: I'm already taking the ibuprofen
1/4/16, 11:56 - Emos: can u help sth
1/4/16, 11:56 - Cindy L: OK what
1/4/16, 11:56 - Emos: theres a confusing question
1/4/16, 11:57 - Mom: Is there any Â∑ùË≤ùÊûáÊù∑Èú≤ in UK pharmacy?
1/4/16, 11:58 - Cindy L: Ofc not
1/4/16, 11:58 - Cindy L: I'll go to boots later see what they have
1/4/16, 11:58 - Emos: what does this mean: List the reasons why the Trojan Shark helps Fabien Cousteau study real sharks and challenge misconceptions about them
1/4/16, 11:59 - Mom: i'm afraid that if u get used to the inhaler, effect will be same as the nasal spray
1/4/16, 11:59 - Cindy L: So I assume a Trojan shark is a fake shark?
1/4/16, 11:59 - Emos: yup
1/4/16, 11:59 - Cindy L: I only hv 7 days worth of inhaler dw
1/4/16, 12:00 - Cindy L: Is this science?
1/4/16, 12:00 - Emos: no its english
1/4/16, 12:00 - Cindy L: What then u should have a reading
1/4/16, 12:00 - Cindy L: the answer is in the reading
1/4/16, 12:01 - Emos: yeah it talks about the features of the trojan shark and its adaptations
1/4/16, 12:01 - Emos: i mean like whats the question asking
1/4/16, 12:01 - Emos: this is question is really
1/4/16, 12:01 - Emos: bad
1/4/16, 12:02 - Emos: and when the question is repeated is also written differently
1/4/16, 12:04 - Cindy L: so i think u have to say how the lady uses the trojan sharks to study real sharks
1/4/16, 12:04 - Emos: IKR
1/4/16, 12:04 - Emos: and its asking me WHY
1/4/16, 12:04 - Emos: theres no WHY  points
1/4/16, 12:06 - Cindy L: why?
1/4/16, 12:06 - Emos: whatever in one question they asked how
1/4/16, 12:06 - Emos: so ill just say how

1/4/16, 16:17 - Cindy L: And I recover fast too
1/4/16, 16:17 - Cindy L: As soon as I catch my breath
1/4/16, 16:17 - Mom: u mean slightly happy feeling will trigger ur muscle atonia now?
1/4/16, 16:18 - Cindy L: No this is just in reaction to funny YouTube videoa I was watching this morning
1/4/16, 16:19 - Mom: so the trigger point is always the funny video, right?
1/4/16, 16:19 - Cindy L: I guess
1/4/16, 16:19 - Cindy L: If it happens once, its easier to happen again
1/4/16, 16:19 - Cindy L: It's like sneezing

1/5/16, 13:40 - Mom: how's that?
1/5/16, 13:40 - Cindy L: It was easy
1/5/16, 13:40 - Cindy L: Which is disappointing
1/5/16, 13:40 - Mom: why?
1/5/16, 13:40 - Cindy L: Cuz I found out I'm not good at abstract thinking
1/5/16, 13:41 - Cindy L: I rather it was hard as hell and everybody failed together
1/5/16, 13:41 - Mom: abstract thinking? why need abstract thinking in econ?
1/5/16, 13:42 - Mom: hey, ur not competing with ur schoolmates, everybody get good grades if that's easy
1/5/16, 13:42 - Cindy L: Cuz demand and supply curves r very abstract.
1/5/16, 13:42 - Mom: but u can plot them in a graph
1/5/16, 13:43 - Mom: that's not rlly abstract
1/5/16, 13:43 - Mom: think abt the phil questions
1/5/16, 13:43 - Mom: u can't draw pic neither
1/5/16, 13:43 - Mom: but did u sleep during the exam hrs?
1/5/16, 13:43 - Cindy L: No
1/5/16, 13:44 - Mom: not sleepy at all?
1/5/16, 13:44 - Cindy L: i dunno graphs are abstract
1/5/16, 13:44 - Cindy L: taxes are abstract.
1/5/16, 13:44 - Mom: then go to engineering la
1/5/16, 13:44 - Cindy L: yeah i wanna crawl back to physics
1/5/16, 13:44 - Cindy L: but nvm
1/5/16, 13:44 - Cindy L: i already finished feeling bad for myself.
1/5/16, 13:45 - Mom: what? taxes abstract they're money
1/5/16, 13:45 - Cindy L: hahaha
1/5/16, 13:45 - Mom: what bad?
1/5/16, 13:45 - Cindy L: taxes only take form when u have to pay them
1/5/16, 13:45 - Mom: the econ exam or the imperial application?
1/5/16, 13:45 - Cindy L: ofc econ
1/5/16, 13:45 - Cindy L: i think i did pretty good on my app
1/5/16, 13:45 - Mom: so funny
1/5/16, 13:46 - Cindy L: well i think i did okay on the econ thing
1/5/16, 13:46 - Mom: then ur destiny to be an engineer la
1/5/16, 13:46 - Mom: it's lucky that u don't try law
1/5/16, 13:46 - Cindy L: law is def
1/5/16, 13:47 - Cindy L: i'm confused about what causes what to shift
1/5/16, 13:48 - Cindy L: i think its something u need to do more practice to be more familiar with
1/5/16, 13:48 - Mom: that's why i always say econ is hard at uni level
1/5/16, 13:48 - Mom: ofc la
1/5/16, 13:48 - Cindy L: yea i think it would be better if i did it at high schl
1/5/16, 13:48 - Mom: practice practice and practice
1/5/16, 13:49 - Mom: nvm la
1/5/16, 13:49 - Mom: just read more extra materials
1/5/16, 13:49 - Cindy L: difficult to think in the econ frame of mind in only 10 weeks.
1/5/16, 13:49 - Cindy L: i think maybe if it had more math it would be easier
1/5/16, 13:50 - Mom: do u hv textbook?
1/5/16, 13:50 - Cindy L: yes wordy as hell
1/5/16, 13:50 - Mom: u shud go for a reading textbook

1/5/16, 14:57 - Cindy L: mopps u have so much to learn.
1/5/16, 14:57 - Mom: no, i'm not going to learn these stuff
1/5/16, 14:58 - Cindy L: why this is internet culture
1/5/16, 14:58 - Emos: she has too much stuff to learn
1/5/16, 14:58 - Cindy L: hahahaha
1/5/16, 14:58 - Mom: exactly
1/5/16, 14:58 - Mom: too much on my waiting list already
1/5/16, 14:58 - Cindy L: i worked out why hello internet is called that
1/5/16, 14:59 - Emos: why
1/5/16, 14:59 - Cindy L: do u know about hello worl
1/5/16, 14:59 - Cindy L: hello world
1/5/16, 14:59 - Cindy L: the hello world program
1/5/16, 15:00 - Emos: isnt hello world the thing u test
1/5/16, 15:00 - Cindy L: its the first thing u learn to program when u learn to code
1/5/16, 15:00 - Emos: ik
1/5/16, 15:00 - Cindy L: yeah
1/5/16, 15:00 - Cindy L: hence hello internet
1/5/16, 15:00 - Cindy L: cuz it's two dudes chatting about the internet
1/5/16, 15:01 - Cindy L: but that's where it comes from.
1/5/16, 15:01 - Emos: oh che
1/5/16, 15:02 - Cindy L: and for some reason the internet is obsessed with flags
1/5/16, 15:03 - Mom: what r ur plans for the rest of this week?
1/5/16, 15:03 - Mom: just gaming?
1/5/16, 15:04 - Cindy L: eat sleep shit
1/5/16, 15:04 - Emos: go be a productive human
1/5/16, 15:04 - Cindy L: i'm a super productive human
1/5/16, 15:04 - Mom: bc u produce shit?
1/5/16, 15:04 - Cindy L: oh lol thats a good one
1/5/16, 15:05 - Mom: so to be a productive human, just shit and no more eat and sleep, right?
1/5/16, 15:05 - Cindy L: i'm gonna start my research paper..
1/5/16, 15:06 - Cindy L: sigh how do i choose which question to do
1/5/16, 15:06 - Mom: pick the easy one
1/5/16, 15:06 - Cindy L: but u don't know which one is the easy one until u start doing the research
1/5/16, 15:07 - Mom: easy one = the one u understand how to start
1/5/16, 15:07 - Cindy L: i know how to start for all of them
1/5/16, 15:07 - Cindy L: step 1 = go to the library
1/5/16, 15:07 - Cindy L: read the shit
1/5/16, 15:08 - Cindy L: but developing thesis is hard cuz she expects us to argue something original
1/5/16, 15:09 - Mom: no, i mean u understand the problems of the question
1/5/16, 15:10 - Cindy L: do u think i should do the voting ones?
1/5/16, 15:10 - Cindy L: i'm not very good at voter theory
1/5/16, 15:11 - Cindy L: so you get questions like this
1/5/16, 15:12 - Cindy L: ‚ÄòPolitical space is primarily determined by class conflict‚Äô. Discuss.
1/5/16, 15:12 - Cindy L: and you also get 'why' questions
1/5/16, 15:12 - Cindy L: like why are not all the countries in the world democratic
1/5/16, 15:13 - Cindy L: why questions are hard ‚òπ
1/5/16, 15:13 - Mom: 2 questions only?
1/5/16, 15:13 - Cindy L: no there are more
1/5/16, 15:14 - Cindy L: i've already eliminated the last three
1/5/16, 15:14 - Mom: first one looks easier, i think
1/5/16, 15:14 - Cindy L: yeah deceivingly
1/5/16, 15:15 - Cindy L: wait or did u mean the class conflict one?
1/5/16, 15:15 - Cindy L: theres also what explains the longevity of autocratic rulers
1/5/16, 15:15 - Mom: second one is hard cuz u hv to research lots of political systems b4 u can reach ur conclusion
1/5/16, 15:16 - Mom: yea class conflict one
1/5/16, 15:16 - Cindy L: ok. i see
1/5/16, 15:16 - Cindy L: so i need to choose a narrow question
1/5/16, 15:18 - Mom: not know what u mean "narrow", but class conflict one is rather factual
1/5/16, 15:19 - Cindy L: really?
1/5/16, 15:19 - Mom: first impression
1/5/16, 15:19 - Mom: but still have to do a little research first
1/5/16, 15:19 - Cindy L: i think it's just about political divisions
1/5/16, 15:20 - Cindy L: ok i'll do that one
1/5/16, 15:20 - Mom: but for the second one, i can think of the way how i argue and discuss my point of view now
1/5/16, 15:21 - Cindy L: yeah it's a why question
1/5/16, 15:21 - Mom: u hv to do a preliminary reading first to form a rough idea how u could deal with the question first
1/5/16, 15:21 - Cindy L: yeah exactly
1/5/16, 15:22 - Mom: how much time u hv to do this paper?
1/5/16, 15:22 - Cindy L: like a month
1/5/16, 15:22 - Mom: how many words to write?
1/5/16, 15:22 - Cindy L: 2000
1/5/16, 15:22 - Cindy L: not a lot
1/5/16, 15:22 - Cindy L: but they want u to use their readings lol
1/5/16, 15:22 - Cindy L: so they already tell u wat to read
1/5/16, 15:22 - Mom: 2000 is not a lot, but a month is just ok
1/5/16, 15:23 - Cindy L: a month is a lot of time.
1/5/16, 15:23 - Mom: it's good ah
1/5/16, 15:23 - Cindy L: i did the last one in a week
1/5/16, 15:23 - Mom: u don't hv to bother to find research materials
1/5/16, 15:23 - Mom: what grade u got?
1/5/16, 15:23 - Cindy L: 59
1/5/16, 15:23 - Cindy L: hahahaha
1/5/16, 15:24 - Mom: in a week? including reading?
1/5/16, 15:24 - Cindy L: yep
1/5/16, 15:24 - Mom: that's why u got 59
1/5/16, 15:24 - Cindy L: probably
1/5/16, 15:24 - Mom: u hv to use a week to write the paper and the rest 3 weeks for reading
1/5/16, 15:25 - Cindy L: wow
1/5/16, 15:25 - Mom: bear in mind that u don't read everyday
1/5/16, 15:25 - Cindy L: right
1/5/16, 15:25 - Mom: so, my time allocation is ok
1/5/16, 15:26 - Cindy L: meh.
1/5/16, 15:27 - Mom: think abt ur ucas ps, u hv written it for almost a week
1/5/16, 15:27 - Mom: but u don't even have to do research work wow
1/5/16, 15:28 - Mom: like emos said, do some productive work la
1/5/16, 15:28 - Cindy L: what do u mean about ucas?
1/5/16, 15:28 - Cindy L: ps is done
1/5/16, 15:28 - Cindy L: now it's just learning about engineering topics and design
1/5/16, 15:28 - Cindy L: which i'm already doing
1/5/16, 15:29 - Mom: i mean ur ps writing, u hv used a week to write it
1/5/16, 15:29 - Cindy L: ps takes a lot of time
1/5/16, 15:29 - Cindy L: it's different
1/5/16, 15:29 - Cindy L: research paper and that shit is pretty formulaic
1/5/16, 15:30 - Mom: so taking a month to write a phil paper is not a lot of time
1/5/16, 15:30 - Mom: right?
1/5/16, 15:30 - Mom: no tkd ma?
1/5/16, 15:31 - Cindy L: it's not a phil paper dw
1/5/16, 15:32 - Cindy L: it's just a poli sci paper
1/5/16, 15:32 - Cindy L: no things don't start until week 2
1/5/16, 15:32 - Cindy L: hahahahaüòì
1/5/16, 15:32 - Mom: almost the same la cuz they need arguments and ur point of view ma
1/5/16, 15:32 - Cindy L: there's literally nothing to do
1/5/16, 15:32 - Cindy L: no phil paper is much more difficult
1/5/16, 15:32 - Cindy L: u gotta like reason
1/5/16, 15:33 - Cindy L: and do philosophy
1/5/16, 15:33 - Cindy L: and most of it is just u defining stuff
1/5/16, 15:33 - Mom: so boring
1/5/16, 15:34 - Mom: and meaningless
1/5/16, 15:34 - Cindy L: yeah i gotta go down to m&s later to get my three boxes of juice
1/5/16, 15:34 - Cindy L: i hate shopping at m&s cuz they always make u purchase in bulk
1/5/16, 15:34 - Cindy L: u can't just buy one
1/5/16, 15:35 - Cindy L: they make u buy three
1/5/16, 15:35 - Mom: why not sainsbury, waitrose?
1/5/16, 15:35 - Cindy L: and i can't buy three of everything
1/5/16, 15:35 - Cindy L: cuz m&s has more interesting stuff?
1/5/16, 15:35 - Cindy L: sainsbury is good cuz its close and cheap and teh machines are responsive
1/5/16, 15:35 - Mom: but u hv to buy 3 wooo?
1/5/16, 15:35 - Cindy L: waitrose is good for quality
1/5/16, 15:35 - Cindy L: yea
1/5/16, 15:35 - Cindy L: but eexpensive
1/5/16, 15:36 - Cindy L: and the machines suck
1/5/16, 15:36 - Cindy L: and they mostly sell takeout
1/5/16, 15:36 - Cindy L: i gotta go all teh way to brunswick to go to the big waitrose
1/5/16, 15:36 - Cindy L: and i've never done so
1/5/16, 15:36 - Mom: but goods at m&s r still expensive
1/5/16, 15:36 - Cindy L: yeah but its cheap in bulk
1/5/16, 15:37 - Cindy L: they always offer bulk deals
1/5/16, 15:37 - Mom: then u'll hv 3 identical meals each time u shop at m&s
1/5/16, 15:37 - Cindy L: so annoying cuz i only brought one bag
1/5/16, 15:37 - Cindy L: exactl

1/5/16, 17:46 - Mom: u blow ur nose so much?
1/5/16, 18:29 - Cindy L: Maybe
1/5/16, 18:31 - Cindy L: Like I said a lot of blood in gen
1/5/16, 20:20 - Cindy L: Just realized I forgot to bring my brush back
1/5/16, 20:50 - Mom: what brush?
1/5/16, 20:53 - Mom: the dried blood stop now?
1/5/16, 22:26 - Cindy L: Yea
1/5/16, 22:26 - Cindy L: I nearly finished all my meds
1/5/16, 22:26 - Cindy L: I'm finally back to original status now
1/5/16, 22:26 - Cindy L: Hairbrush
1/5/16, 22:26 - Cindy L: Actually I don't think I brought one to HK with me
1/5/16, 22:27 - Cindy L: Whatever
1/5/16, 22:27 - Cindy L: I can't find my hairbrush
1/5/16, 22:45 - Cindy L: And blood clots are still coming out of my nose
1/5/16, 23:25 - Cindy L: I think I'm going into depression again,...
1/6/16, 05:11 - Mom: 1.  u did have left ur hairbrush here
1/6/16, 05:14 - Mom: 2.  lots of blood clots everyday? i advise u try not to blow it too hard, just take them out gently cuz u hv inflammation at ur respiratory system
1/6/16, 05:15 - Mom: 3.  finish all ur med and back to original status = get well? no fever, no inflammation and breathing and nasal ok?
1/6/16, 05:15 - Mom: 4.  why depression again? lonely at dorm?
1/6/16, 05:16 - Mom: if then, go outside for leisure walking la
1/6/16, 09:50 - Cindy L: Cuz whatever is on my third finger and fourth finger has also spread to my pinky.
1/6/16, 09:50 - Cindy L: Once it's like this it doesn't heal
1/6/16, 09:51 - Mom: did u put triderm med on them?
1/6/16, 09:53 - Mom: don't bother them, just put moisturizer on them
1/6/16, 09:53 - Mom: emos got those eczema on fingers as well, but hers go away by itself
1/6/16, 09:54 - Cindy L: I'm gonna triderm them
1/6/16, 09:54 - Cindy L: And then I'm outta ideas
1/6/16, 09:55 - Mom: just put triderm 2/3 times cuz more won't help
1/6/16, 09:55 - Cindy L: K
1/6/16, 09:56 - Mom: how's ur depression?
1/6/16, 09:56 - Cindy L: YouTube videos r breaking my neck
1/6/16, 09:56 - Mom: then limit ur youtube time la
1/6/16, 09:56 - Mom: even though u hv to release ur pressure
1/6/16, 09:56 - Cindy L: But three videos and then I collapse
1/6/16, 09:57 - Mom: totally collapse?
1/6/16, 09:57 - Cindy L: Yep
1/6/16, 09:57 - Cindy L: That's why they break my neck
1/6/16, 09:57 - Cindy L: And I'm not recovering as fast
1/6/16, 09:58 - Mom: that's why i told u to be limit ur youtube time
1/6/16, 09:58 - Cindy L: Even when I get up theres still a tingling feeling
1/6/16, 09:58 - Cindy L: And it's easy to drop again if its tingling
1/6/16, 09:58 - Mom: first time tingling feeling?
1/6/16, 09:58 - Cindy L: No
1/6/16, 09:58 - Mom: did u hv that feeling b4, i mean in Hk
1/6/16, 09:59 - Cindy L: Didn't notice
1/6/16, 09:59 - Mom: but u didn't mention it b4
1/6/16, 09:59 - Cindy L: I didn't really watch that many YouTube videos i n hk
1/6/16, 09:59 - Cindy L: Just notice noe
1/6/16, 09:59 - Mom: both hands/arms/legs?
1/6/16, 09:59 - Cindy L: Arms
1/6/16, 10:00 - Cindy L: Upper torso area
1/6/16, 10:00 - Mom: it's rather strange that traditional cataplexy affect the legs first?
1/6/16, 10:01 - Cindy L: Well its more like sudden loss of muscle tone
1/6/16, 10:01 - Cindy L: Than straight to definition cataplexy
1/6/16, 10:02 - Cindy L: Basically my symptoms are just generally easy to slip into rem, and sudden loss of muscle usually induced by laughing.
1/6/16, 10:02 - Mom: ur conscious, right?
1/6/16, 10:02 - Cindy L: The sleep stuff seems to hv mostly disappeared
1/6/16, 10:02 - Cindy L: For now
1/6/16, 10:03 - Cindy L: Yes totally conscience
1/6/16, 10:03 - Cindy L: Concious
1/6/16, 10:03 - Cindy L: Conscious
1/6/16, 10:03 - Mom: i think that's rather rem sleep?
1/6/16, 10:03 - Cindy L: I barely nap nowadays
1/6/16, 10:04 - Cindy L: It's like the sleeping thing has disappeared
1/6/16, 10:04 - Mom: how many hours u sleep at night time?
1/6/16, 10:04 - Cindy L: I get a bit sleepy after meals
1/6/16, 10:04 - Cindy L: Er lemme check
1/6/16, 10:05 - Cindy L: So I slept a lot when I was sick, like 8 hrs
1/6/16, 10:05 - Mom: this is normal, everybody needs lots of sleep during sick time
1/6/16, 10:06 - Mom: did u wake up at 4 in the mid-night?
1/6/16, 10:07 - Cindy L: Yea
1/6/16, 10:07 - Cindy L: After 4 is light sleep
1/6/16, 10:07 - Mom: when u said u had many blood clots from nose, do u have headaches as well?
1/6/16, 10:08 - Cindy L: No
1/6/16, 10:08 - Cindy L: Just blew my nose and blood still there
1/6/16, 10:08 - Mom: physically wake up at 4 or just show light sleep from ur sleep watch?
1/6/16, 10:08 - Cindy L: But I cleaned out my nose so the blood isn't from the nose
1/6/16, 10:09 - Mom: then, i think u blood vessels inside ur nose is hurt
1/6/16, 10:09 - Cindy L: I am on the border of consciousness around 4 am
1/6/16, 10:09 - Mom: u didn't get out the bed?
1/6/16, 10:09 - Cindy L: I can usually lucid dream
1/6/16, 10:09 - Cindy L: Cuz I know I'm sleeping
1/6/16, 10:10 - Cindy L: But dream mechanics r hard to control
1/6/16, 10:10 - Mom: u know ur dreaming after 4?
1/6/16, 10:10 - Cindy L: Pretty much
1/6/16, 10:10 - Cindy L: Sometimes I wakeup
1/6/16, 10:10 - Mom: how long ur dream lasts?
1/6/16, 10:10 - Cindy L: Like last night and I just poke on the ipad
1/6/16, 10:11 - Cindy L: If I keep dreaming usually I sleep deeper for another bloc
1/6/16, 10:11 - Cindy L: And wakeup around 8
1/6/16, 10:11 - Mom: keep away from all electronic devices after waking at 4, otherwise u'll be difficult to sleep again
1/6/16, 10:11 - Cindy L: Actually I find it easy to go into sws in the morning
1/6/16, 10:12 - Cindy L: Like after 6
1/6/16, 10:12 - Cindy L: Is good sleeping time
1/6/16, 10:12 - Mom: why say so?
1/6/16, 10:12 - Cindy L: Dunno
1/6/16, 10:12 - Cindy L: I just drift off easily
1/6/16, 10:12 - Cindy L: But during 4, Brain doesn't want to sleep
1/6/16, 10:13 - Mom: but u said u don't nap, how come drift off easily?
1/6/16, 10:13 - Mom: when?
1/6/16, 10:13 - Cindy L: Like when I'm still in bed around 6-8
1/6/16, 10:13 - Cindy L: After that I just wake up
1/6/16, 10:14 - Mom: that means u can return to sleep state easily furing 6-8?
1/6/16, 10:14 - Cindy L: Yea
1/6/16, 10:14 - Cindy L: From 6-8 am
1/6/16, 10:14 - Cindy L: I don't take morning naps anymore
1/6/16, 10:14 - Cindy L: More like I don't just pass out suddenly
1/6/16, 10:15 - Mom: u said ur blood clots seems not coming from nose, do u think they're from ur brain?
1/6/16, 10:15 - Cindy L: But I haven't been to a lecture so far so I dunno
1/6/16, 10:15 - Mom: what abt afternoon nap?
1/6/16, 10:15 - Cindy L: Not really
1/6/16, 10:15 - Cindy L: Maybe aroudn evening
1/6/16, 10:15 - Cindy L: But I deliberately take one when I actually feel tires
1/6/16, 10:15 - Cindy L: Tired
1/6/16, 10:15 - Mom: ok
1/6/16, 10:16 - Mom: what time on bed?
1/6/16, 10:16 - Cindy L: Around 12
1/6/16, 10:16 - Mom: better b4 11
1/6/16, 10:16 - Mom: did u take cherrytart supplements and fish oil
1/6/16, 10:19 - Cindy L: For the muscle atonia, I can stop mild ones by contracting all my muscles
1/6/16, 10:20 - Cindy L: That's my main method of control for now.
1/6/16, 10:20 - Cindy L: In response to funny stimulus, it happens too quickly so I can't do the same
1/6/16, 10:20 - Mom: what's ur muscles response to scary movies?
1/6/16, 10:21 - Cindy L: No muscle response, but there's a big response in the brain. I don't feel good looking at scary stuff
1/6/16, 10:22 - Mom: what's that no feeling good response?
1/6/16, 10:22 - Cindy L: If I'm walking and I see scary stimulus, I often get mild loss of muscle tone
1/6/16, 10:22 - Cindy L: Starting from legs
1/6/16, 10:22 - Cindy L: Not sure
1/6/16, 10:23 - Cindy L: Cannot ssay exactly because I cannot recall right now
1/6/16, 10:23 - Mom: did u fall?
1/6/16, 10:23 - Cindy L: No its mild so I just tense my muscles
1/6/16, 10:23 - Cindy L: My my eyes go funny
1/6/16, 10:23 - Cindy L: Thoufh
1/6/16, 10:23 - Cindy L: Though
1/6/16, 10:24 - Cindy L: Probably rem eye movements
1/6/16, 10:24 - Mom: what is "eyes go funny"? double vision?
1/6/16, 10:24 - Cindy L: Like rem eye movements start
1/6/16, 10:24 - Cindy L: Makes ur eyes roll around separately
1/6/16, 10:24 - Cindy L: I think
1/6/16, 10:25 - Cindy L: Probably not separately, but just roll aroudn out of your control
1/6/16, 10:25 - Cindy L: So u cant see properly
1/6/16, 10:25 - Mom: what abt if u closed ur eyes immediately at that moment, will the muscles weakness feeling go away?
1/6/16, 10:25 - Cindy L: No
1/6/16, 10:26 - Cindy L: But if I closed my eyes, it will be easier to control
1/6/16, 10:26 - Cindy L: And less likely to go again
1/6/16, 10:26 - Cindy L: But I can't walk on the street with my eyes closed
1/6/16, 10:27 - Cindy L: Sitting down is like a whole new story
1/6/16, 10:27 - Mom: i mean u stand still and have ur eyes closed for 1/2 second
1/6/16, 10:27 - Cindy L: Yep
1/6/16, 10:28 - Cindy L: I hv to prevent further loss of muscle tone by tensing up, regain control by controlling breathing rate and also eye mvmt
1/6/16, 10:29 - Cindy L: Basically that's what happens for weak ones.
1/6/16, 10:29 - Cindy L: Strong proper ones I just collapse cuz I can't control them
1/6/16, 10:29 - Cindy L: Also weak ones only happen when I'm moving or standing
1/6/16, 10:29 - Cindy L: When I sit, its just strong ones
1/6/16, 10:31 - Cindy L: And then there are also the less freq seizure like ones
1/6/16, 10:31 - Cindy L: During those I am sitting and I do not regain control for a long time.
1/6/16, 10:32 - Cindy L: I look look im sleeping But I am conscious.
1/6/16, 10:32 - Cindy L: These are probably the ones u filmed.
1/6/16, 10:32 - Cindy L: I think
1/6/16, 10:32 - Mom: is ur body shaking?
1/6/16, 10:32 - Cindy L: Not sure, I feel like it is but its not visible
1/6/16, 10:33 - Cindy L: Like muscles in facial areas r relax and contracting really quickly
1/6/16, 10:34 - Mom: just happen at face?
1/6/16, 10:35 - Cindy L: Not sure, from what I can recall I only remember instances from the face. Head and neck area
1/6/16, 10:35 - Cindy L: It's not shaking
1/6/16, 10:35 - Cindy L: It's muscles relaxing and contracting
1/6/16, 10:35 - Cindy L: Feels more like they r pulsing
1/6/16, 10:36 - Cindy L: Loss of muscle tone may cause shaking when I try to get up but my muscles r still too weak to support my body
1/6/16, 10:36 - Mom: all these incidents happen after u return to uk?
1/6/16, 10:36 - Cindy L: No I'm just reporting condition up to now.
1/6/16, 10:37 - Cindy L: Have been happening since UK and hk
1/6/16, 10:37 - Mom: ok, more clear picture now
1/6/16, 10:38 - Mom: i'll try to figure out what happens in ur body?
1/6/16, 10:38 - Mom: anyway, control ur youtube time la
1/6/16, 10:38 - Mom: no good to ur neck
1/6/16, 10:40 - Cindy L: K
1/6/16, 10:42 - Cindy L: Regarding mental state still easy to fall into depression if no distraction.
1/6/16, 10:42 - Mom: keep taking those cherrytart pills and fish oil
1/6/16, 10:42 - Cindy L: Probably linked to my loss of confidence
1/6/16, 10:42 - Cindy L: Cuz I seem to always be in perma-depression
1/6/16, 10:43 - Mom: why do u think ur in depression?
1/6/16, 10:43 - Cindy L: Dunno life
1/6/16, 10:44 - Cindy L: If I had my confidence back I think it would hv positive long term results.
1/6/16, 10:44 - Cindy L: Just shower thoughts.
1/6/16, 10:44 - Mom: how wud u regain ur confidence, u think?
1/6/16, 10:45 - Mom: and why ur of no confidence now?
1/6/16, 10:45 - Mom: bc of ur sleep disorder?
1/6/16, 10:46 - Cindy L: I think I just lost all confidence after going into hospital.
1/6/16, 10:46 - Cindy L: After coming out of hospital I meant
1/6/16, 10:46 - Mom: wow, that's a very bad experience
1/6/16, 10:47 - Cindy L: Sort of like feeling very unsure abt everything.
1/6/16, 10:47 - Cindy L: Uncertainties that's it.
1/6/16, 10:47 - Cindy L: Too many uncertainties in life.
1/6/16, 10:48 - Cindy L: Probably didn't realise it before November 2014
1/6/16, 10:48 - Cindy L: I can literally say I started being depressed since Nov 2104.
1/6/16, 10:50 - Mom: well, i don't think that's all ur life
1/6/16, 10:50 - Emos: i go home now
1/6/16, 10:50 - Cindy L: OK I thought abt it more.
1/6/16, 10:50 - Cindy L: Lack of achievement
1/6/16, 10:50 - Cindy L: Probably that
1/6/16, 10:51 - Mom: indeed u have a very special experience which u think u can't cope with bc ur still at young age
1/6/16, 10:51 - Cindy L: Nothing feels successful
1/6/16, 10:52 - Mom: but that's ur opportunity for u to grow, ofc u lesson is a bit hard
1/6/16, 10:52 - Mom: but u have to learn to overcome it, otherwise that's is all ur remaining life
1/6/16, 10:53 - Mom: other ppl might have bigger/smaller challenges, we don't know
1/6/16, 10:53 - Cindy L: No I don't think it's that thing.
1/6/16, 10:53 - Cindy L: It's lack of success
1/6/16, 10:54 - Mom: and don't think ur unlucky, just think positively and find ways to overcome ur difficulties
1/6/16, 10:54 - Cindy L: U know like feeling of achievement
1/6/16, 10:54 - Cindy L: I don't feel that I'm unlucky.
1/6/16, 10:54 - Cindy L: Like no special success
1/6/16, 10:55 - Cindy L: Plus too many damaging things to self esteem.
1/6/16, 10:55 - Mom: "sense of achievement" this is somewhat curious
1/6/16, 10:55 - Cindy L: So that's they confidence is at an all time low
1/6/16, 10:55 - Mom: it depends on how u think
1/6/16, 10:55 - Cindy L: That's why
1/6/16, 10:55 - Cindy L: No its an actual feeling
1/6/16, 10:55 - Cindy L: An emotion in ur brain
1/6/16, 10:56 - Mom: if u think u can kick in tkd class, that's kind of achievement, then u'll be more balance at ur mental state
1/6/16, 10:56 - Cindy L: Or success triggers a euphoria circuit in the brain or something
1/6/16, 10:56 - Cindy L: Kicking is stress relief
1/6/16, 10:57 - Cindy L: Not achievement
1/6/16, 10:57 - Mom: don't ever think of big achievement like scoring 43+, earning scholarship, etc
1/6/16, 10:57 - Cindy L: No
1/6/16, 10:57 - Cindy L: I mean as in
1/6/16, 10:57 - Cindy L: Getting a paycheck
1/6/16, 10:57 - Cindy L: That sort of stuff
1/6/16, 10:58 - Cindy L: I guess scoring 43 would be achievement, but probably not a big effect for me.
1/6/16, 10:58 - Cindy L: Scholarship would be a big success.
1/6/16, 10:58 - Cindy L: OK I hv idea now
1/6/16, 10:59 - Cindy L: Ta ta
1/6/16, 10:59 - Emos: mops did u buy food
1/6/16, 10:59 - Mom: the sense of achievement depends on how u define "achievemeent"
1/6/16, 11:00 - Mom: even minute things done wud be achievement, and that wud make ppl happy
1/6/16, 11:00 - Mom: like u learn to sing a song, doing a good kick at tkd class
1/6/16, 11:01 - Mom: these r also achievements, u know
1/6/16, 11:01 - Mom: emos: i bought food for u already
1/6/16, 11:01 - Emos: üëåüèªthx
1/6/16, 11:04 - Cindy L: Yea but it doesn't just depend on 'frame of mind'. Cuz I need the feel good juice achievement stimulates
1/6/16, 11:04 - Mom: perhaps, i'm the one to be blame for ur lack of confidence bc i don't usually explicitly say what u have done/achieved during ur development ages are rlly good work
1/6/16, 11:05 - Emos: thx (did u get the last message cuz my phone turned off suddenly)
1/6/16, 11:05 - Mom: what last msg?
1/6/16, 11:06 - Mom: cindy: see my comments at 1104
1/6/16, 11:07 - Mom: i'm also thinking of our family relationship these days and hope we can make a change
1/6/16, 11:09 - Emos: yeah guess u didnt

1/6/16, 12:36 - Cindy L: No
1/6/16, 12:36 - Cindy L: Did u lose one?
1/6/16, 12:36 - Mom: don't know, just checking
1/6/16, 12:36 - Cindy L: Btw I got more info abt the seizure like eps
1/6/16, 12:36 - Cindy L: Cuz I just had one
1/6/16, 12:37 - Mom: what?
1/6/16, 12:37 - Cindy L: The stuff I mistake for hallucinations
1/6/16, 12:37 - Mom: eds?
1/6/16, 12:38 - Mom: or eps?
1/6/16, 12:38 - Cindy L: It's a rem
1/6/16, 12:38 - Cindy L: But I can see the things around me
1/6/16, 12:38 - Mom: is ur eyes open or closed?
1/6/16, 12:38 - Cindy L: Difficult to breath cuz I breath more heavy
1/6/16, 12:39 - Cindy L: Not sure cuz I saw the same things around me but with weird stuff
1/6/16, 12:40 - Cindy L: Like I had the iPad open in front of me propped up by the stand
1/6/16, 12:40 - Cindy L: And then during the ep, I kept see a reflection of someone standing behind me
1/6/16, 12:41 - Cindy L: I kept looking because I swear there was just me in the kitchen
1/6/16, 12:42 - Cindy L: I also tried to interact with the thing but no change of image, still just a reflection of someone standing behind me
1/6/16, 12:43 - Mom: that incident happened in the kitchen, right?
1/6/16, 12:43 - Cindy L: And then I also often hear people talking outside if the kitchen
1/6/16, 12:43 - Cindy L: Yp
1/6/16, 12:44 - Mom: how did u try to interact with that reflection?
1/6/16, 12:44 - Cindy L: Touch
1/6/16, 12:45 - Cindy L: Tried to push her
1/6/16, 12:45 - Mom: u rlly stretch ur arms or just imagination?
1/6/16, 12:45 - Cindy L: I moved for real
1/6/16, 12:46 - Mom: how did u know it's a "her"
1/6/16, 12:46 - Cindy L: Cuz wearing a white dress in reflection
1/6/16, 12:47 - Cindy L: Lasted quite a while and happened on its own
1/6/16, 12:47 - Mom: where in the kitchen the reflection of her stands, cuz i remember that there's no mirror or metal thingy in the kitchen?
1/6/16, 12:47 - Cindy L: IPad allscreen
1/6/16, 12:48 - Mom: ur pushing a white reflection behind u, right?
1/6/16, 12:49 - Mom: how did u turn ur hands at the time of pushing?
1/6/16, 12:50 - Mom: u saw her in white dress, that means u can see her whole body, right?
1/6/16, 12:51 - Mom: this is a bit strange cuz u seems never have these kind of experience here in hk
1/6/16, 12:51 - Mom: where'r u now? still in the kitchen or inside ur room?
1/6/16, 13:14 - Mom: hey, where have u been? u seem lost suddenly?
1/6/16, 13:40 - Cindy L: No I went to nap
1/6/16, 13:40 - Cindy L: You know if u stand in front of a mirror u can see who is behind u?
1/6/16, 13:41 - Cindy L: I sat in front of a shiny iPad screen
1/6/16, 13:41 - Cindy L: Switched off
1/6/16, 13:41 - Cindy L: It was off to my left
1/6/16, 13:41 - Cindy L: So I knew it was next to me
1/6/16, 13:41 - Cindy L: Cuz behind me is the oven
1/6/16, 13:42 - Cindy L: So I flail my arms to the left to see if it will change the white reflection
1/6/16, 13:42 - Cindy L: Nothing.
1/6/16, 13:43 - Mom: u just took ur nap voluntarily?
1/6/16, 13:44 - Cindy L: Yup cuz I think it was def lack of sleep last night which caused it
1/6/16, 13:45 - Cindy L: Let's label these hallucinatory like rems.
1/6/16, 13:46 - Cindy L: I think it's the body's way of speed sleeping.
1/6/16, 13:47 - Cindy L: Cuz I only seem to hv them if I didn't get good sleep previous night
1/6/16, 13:48 - Mom: the white reflection disappeared finally?
1/6/16, 13:48 - Cindy L: I only saw it for like 10 or 5 mins I think
1/6/16, 13:49 - Mom: 5 or 10 mins?
1/6/16, 13:49 - Cindy L: I also thought I heard a bunch of people outside renting rooms
1/6/16, 13:49 - Mom: not seconds?
1/6/16, 13:49 - Cindy L: Which is ofc not true cuz I live in dorms
1/6/16, 13:49 - Cindy L: Yea lastes for a while
1/6/16, 13:49 - Cindy L: And then I just snapped out of it
1/6/16, 13:51 - Mom: have u ever thought that ur going crazy?
1/6/16, 13:52 - Mom: these r unbelievable experience
1/6/16, 13:59 - Cindy L: Lol that's why I'm scared easily I think
1/6/16, 13:59 - Cindy L: Cuz I hv so much more stuff to be scared of
1/6/16, 14:00 - Cindy L: Every unlikely scenario I play out in my mind could possible happen cuz my dreams are leaking out of my brain.
1/6/16, 14:01 - Cindy L: I think the eye mask is good.
1/6/16, 14:01 - Mom: then u know ur not seeing thing
1/6/16, 14:02 - Cindy L: Yea but then it cuts off one my senses and that's scary too
1/6/16, 14:02 - Mom: seeing is not always true
1/6/16, 14:02 - Cindy L: Yep but not seeing is like x10 more terrifying
1/6/16, 14:03 - Cindy L: Esp when there are so few people around...
1/6/16, 14:03 - Mom: i think the problem is security, ur lacking security
1/6/16, 14:04 - Mom: as i said, u seldom have these kind of experience in hk
1/6/16, 14:04 - Mom: bc ur insecure, ur imagination comes into play wild
1/6/16, 14:59 - Cindy L: Im writing my CV now.
1/6/16, 14:59 - Cindy L: Brb

1/6/16, 19:04 - Cindy L: Dude u know Joseph ledoux btw?
1/6/16, 19:04 - Cindy L: He's the guy who does research into the amygdala
1/6/16, 19:04 - Cindy L: So apparently he's at nyu
1/6/16, 19:05 - Mom: so?
1/6/16, 19:07 - Cindy L: Emotion circuits guy!
1/6/16, 19:08 - Cindy L: Or was that guy at Georgia tech...
1/6/16, 19:08 - Mom: why dont u try trf to US study biomedical thingy
1/6/16, 19:08 - Mom: I know that
1/6/16, 19:09 - Cindy L: Know what? Ledoux?
1/6/16, 19:09 - Cindy L: He's the amygdala guy
1/6/16, 19:09 - Mom: I saw video telling the emotion system
1/6/16, 19:09 - Cindy L: So I confused him and emotion circuits guy
1/6/16, 19:10 - Mom: amygdala is part of the emotion system
1/6/16, 19:10 - Cindy L: I know its that fear part
1/6/16, 19:11 - Mom: anger, fright, aggressiin
1/6/16, 19:11 - Cindy L: Oh he is also emotion circuits guy
1/6/16, 19:11 - Mom: aggression
1/6/16, 19:11 - Cindy L: So there is a paper called emotion circuits in the brain
1/6/16, 19:12 - Mom: i saw this video
1/6/16, 19:12 - Cindy L: The tedx
1/6/16, 19:13 - Cindy L: Its a different guy in the vid
1/6/16, 19:13 - Cindy L: He talked abt fruit flies or something
1/6/16, 19:13 - Mom: rlly?
1/6/16, 19:13 - Cindy L: I thought abt doing bio
1/6/16, 19:13 - Cindy L: But I can't look at blow up photos of insects.
1/6/16, 19:13 - Cindy L: Hahaha
1/6/16, 19:13 - Cindy L: So I gave up after that
1/6/16, 19:14 - Mom: ic
1/6/16, 19:14 - Mom: It's difficult
1/6/16, 19:15 - Mom: to overcome this kind of feeling
1/6/16, 19:16 - Cindy L: Lol I'm gonna like be dead on the floor if I had to attend a lecture looking at those stuff
1/6/16, 19:17 - Mom: hahaha
1/6/16, 19:52 - Cindy L: U should read science daily.com
1/6/16, 19:52 - Cindy L: Sciencedaily.com
1/6/16, 19:53 - Cindy L: It gives summaries of research papers
1/6/16, 19:53 - Cindy L: Really good
1/7/16, 07:49 - Mom: kkk
1/7/16, 15:05 - Cindy L: Hi
1/7/16, 16:06 - Mom: hello
1/7/16, 16:06 - Mom: bored?
1/7/16, 20:13 - Cindy L: Yes so I went out
1/7/16, 20:13 - Cindy L: I was going a bit crazy
1/7/16, 20:13 - Cindy L: And I couldn't move my finger.
1/7/16, 21:53 - Cindy L: Also I can't stop coughing
1/7/16, 21:54 - Cindy L: There's no more phlegm
1/7/16, 21:54 - Cindy L: But my trachea still feels contracted
1/7/16, 23:53 - Mom: but ur not coughing in hk?
1/7/16, 23:53 - Mom: can u breath smoothly?
1/7/16, 23:55 - Mom: is air dry that makes u cough so much? or try drink more hot water or honey, see if that helps
1/7/16, 23:56 - Mom: what is "can't move finger?"
1/8/16, 01:15 - Cindy L: Yea I was watching youtube videos again
1/8/16, 01:15 - Cindy L: I think the air is dry like u said
1/8/16, 01:16 - Cindy L: I seem to feel that the paralysis seems to last longer these days
1/8/16, 01:16 - Cindy L: I'm actually paralyzed
1/8/16, 01:16 - Cindy L: When I laugh
1/8/16, 01:17 - Mom: why so different response in UK?
1/8/16, 01:17 - Cindy L: I purposely positioned my finger so that it would be easy to tap the screen to pause the video
1/8/16, 01:19 - Cindy L: But when I laughed I couldn't even move the finger down slightly to pause the vid
1/8/16, 01:19 - Cindy L: Completely paralyzed
1/8/16, 01:21 - Mom: still hv blood clots from nose?
1/8/16, 01:23 - Mom: better to sleep first cuz its too late la
1/8/16, 09:27 - Mom: hi
1/8/16, 09:28 - Mom: what's ur password for iTunes store?
1/8/16, 10:33 - Cindy L: 1q1r...
1/8/16, 10:37 - Mom: is there a "?" at the end?
1/8/16, 10:41 - Mom: can't do it?
1/8/16, 10:49 - Cindy L: Exclamation mark
1/8/16, 12:13 - Mom: still hv blood clots from nose?
1/8/16, 12:18 - Cindy L: Yea but less
1/8/16, 12:18 - Cindy L: Mysterious origins
1/8/16, 12:18 - Mom: do u think it from brain?
1/8/16, 12:20 - Cindy L: No cuz no headache
1/8/16, 12:20 - Mom: next time if u have these blood clots, take a pic and send to me
1/8/16, 12:21 - Cindy L: unless
1/8/16, 12:21 - Cindy L: the blood is from the cataplexy/ paralysis attacks
1/8/16, 12:21 - Cindy L: cuz
1/8/16, 12:21 - Cindy L: yesterday
1/8/16, 12:21 - Cindy L: i told u about how i couldn't move my finger
1/8/16, 12:21 - Cindy L: for quite a while
1/8/16, 12:21 - Cindy L: so
1/8/16, 12:21 - Mom: unless what?
1/8/16, 12:22 - Cindy L: i tried very hard to move my finger
1/8/16, 12:22 - Cindy L: and failed to get a response
1/8/16, 12:22 - Cindy L: i think this creates a dissonance or conflict in the brain
1/8/16, 12:23 - Mom: no way, they're not related
1/8/16, 12:23 - Cindy L: and that translates into a physical complication
1/8/16, 12:23 - Mom: any pain feeling of the nose or throat?
1/8/16, 12:23 - Cindy L: nooo wait
1/8/16, 12:23 - Cindy L: the thing is
1/8/16, 12:23 - Cindy L: after finger movement returned
1/8/16, 12:24 - Cindy L: i felt pain in my head
1/8/16, 12:24 - Cindy L: which disappeared after i took walk
1/8/16, 12:24 - Cindy L: so my theory is that
1/8/16, 12:24 - Cindy L: my brain tried to send a cognitive signal to the muscles in the finger
1/8/16, 12:25 - Cindy L: and did not get an expected response
1/8/16, 12:25 - Cindy L: and this creates dissonance
1/8/16, 12:25 - Cindy L: which translates into a physical complication (i.e. possibly eruption of capillaries)
1/8/16, 12:25 - Cindy L: but i guess it doesn't really explain why the blood is only showing up now
1/8/16, 12:26 - Mom: wow, ur theory is so complex and difficult to understand
1/8/16, 12:26 - Cindy L: i watched this talk from ramachandran
1/8/16, 12:27 - Cindy L: he's a famous neuroscientist
1/8/16, 12:27 - Cindy L: and he talked about he helped patients get rid of phantom pains
1/8/16, 12:27 - Cindy L: and rewiring the brain for stroke recovery
1/8/16, 12:28 - Cindy L: and it seems to me that
1/8/16, 12:28 - Cindy L: when the brain runs into cognitive dissonance
1/8/16, 12:28 - Cindy L: when things don't make sense to it
1/8/16, 12:29 - Cindy L: it can rewire itself
1/8/16, 12:29 - Mom: but u don't have blood coming out every time after "cataplexy attack", right?
1/8/16, 12:29 - Cindy L: that is true
1/8/16, 12:29 - Mom: yea, i agree that our brain can rewire itself to suit the environmental chanage
1/8/16, 12:30 - Mom: but first of all, we don't know whether there's any vessel damages inside ur brain
1/8/16, 12:30 - Cindy L: <Media omitted>
1/8/16, 12:30 - Cindy L: but what if the eruptions were very small
1/8/16, 12:31 - Cindy L: and the blood clots have collected somewhere?
1/8/16, 12:32 - Cindy L: i.e. when the paralysis attack was very long duration like yesterday, i only felt pain in my head because the eruption was a significant sizee
1/8/16, 12:32 - Mom: did u feel painful at ur the inside of ur nose or ur throat?
1/8/16, 12:32 - Cindy L: no i cleaned my nose out many times already.
1/8/16, 12:32 - Cindy L: there's no cuts inside
1/8/16, 12:33 - Mom: don't have to be a cut
1/8/16, 12:33 - Cindy L: my throat is still constricted though
1/8/16, 12:33 - Cindy L: like there's no injury inside the nose cavity
1/8/16, 12:33 - Cindy L: on the other hand it could be just coming from the throat
1/8/16, 12:33 - Cindy L: i mean its all connected in there
1/8/16, 12:34 - Cindy L: well just a theory for now
1/8/16, 12:35 - Cindy L: i am also skeptical about the autonomous nervous system being involved
1/8/16, 12:35 - Cindy L: cuz
1/8/16, 12:35 - Cindy L: the affected muscles are voluntary muscles
1/8/16, 12:35 - Cindy L: sorry skeletal muscles
1/8/16, 12:35 - Cindy L: those are controlled voluntarily
1/8/16, 12:36 - Cindy L: by the peripheral nervous system
1/8/16, 12:36 - Cindy L: by the SoNS
1/8/16, 12:37 - Cindy L: if it was the ANS, then smooth muscle would be affect (i.e. my critical organs and shit)
1/8/16, 12:38 - Cindy L: though i still think the amygdala is significant here cuz its the connection point between limbic system and nervous system
1/8/16, 12:39 - Cindy L: i.e. it could also be sort of like when people freeze in fear
1/8/16, 12:40 - Cindy L: which means it would be connected to adrenaline cuz adrenaline regulates the fight or flight response
1/8/16, 12:40 - Cindy L: but i haven't read enough about the amygdala yet.
1/8/16, 12:41 - Cindy L: also why is the blood just coming out now?
1/8/16, 12:42 - Cindy L: could be that blood clots have just collected in my windpipe
1/8/16, 12:42 - Cindy L: since its all connected in there
1/8/16, 12:44 - Cindy L: btw omg did u know artifical skin already exists?
1/8/16, 12:44 - Cindy L: it is like 10 times better than real skin
1/8/16, 12:44 - Mom: that's why i just asked if u have any pain at ur throat
1/8/16, 12:45 - Cindy L: not really pain
1/8/16, 12:45 - Cindy L: it just feels like its constricted
1/8/16, 12:45 - Cindy L: though last time i had strep throat i didn't feel pain either so maybe there is supposed to be pain
1/8/16, 12:45 - Cindy L: cuz i am coughing a lot
1/8/16, 12:46 - Mom: the best possible answer wud be from ur windpipe cuz u have trachea infection
1/8/16, 12:46 - Cindy L: fair enough
1/8/16, 12:46 - Cindy L: that's true
1/8/16, 12:47 - Cindy L: but its still true that the harder i try to move during paralysis, the more likely i am to get a headache
1/8/16, 12:49 - Mom: ???
1/8/16, 12:49 - Cindy L: like the finger scenario i told u above
1/8/16, 12:53 - Mom: but anyway, control ur video/youtube time to minimize possible complications
1/8/16, 12:53 - Cindy L: sure
1/8/16, 12:53 - Mom: u know that hurts ur neck a lot
1/8/16, 12:53 - Cindy L: its fine now
1/8/16, 12:53 - Cindy L: okay no
1/8/16, 12:54 - Cindy L: i hurts a bit if i look up
1/8/16, 12:54 - Cindy L: fast
1/8/16, 12:54 - Mom: i've bought u a neck massage and a neck supporter, will send u next monday
1/8/16, 12:55 - Cindy L: ....
1/8/16, 12:55 - Cindy L: how are ur thyroid hormones btw?
1/8/16, 12:55 - Mom: have blood test taken already but still waiting for u/s scan and the blood test result
1/8/16, 12:56 - Cindy L: ok
1/8/16, 12:56 - Cindy L: no period for december btw
1/8/16, 12:56 - Cindy L: probably cuz switched to hk food or air or water or something
1/8/16, 12:56 - Mom: sigh
1/8/16, 12:57 - Mom: I'm cooking myself Êµ∑Â∏∂ÊπØ everyday to see if that helps my thyroid
1/8/16, 12:58 - Cindy L: sure
1/8/16, 12:58 - Cindy L: i think those things only help when u don't have a problem tbh
1/8/16, 12:59 - Cindy L: so u should eat fruit, veg and yogurt all day like my neighbour
1/8/16, 12:59 - Cindy L: eat meat though or else u will be short
1/8/16, 13:00 - Mom: nvm, it helps cleaning my stomach and instestine cuz i shit a lot every time after drinking the soup
1/8/16, 13:00 - Cindy L: ....
1/8/16, 13:00 - Cindy L: ok tmi
1/8/16, 13:00 - Cindy L: but whatevs
1/8/16, 13:00 - Cindy L: hv u found any interesting things about the amygdala?
1/8/16, 13:01 - Mom: what is interesting?
1/8/16, 13:01 - Cindy L: helpful stuff
1/8/16, 13:01 - Mom: but amygdala is special that the brain neuro there will re-generate
1/8/16, 13:02 - Cindy L: oh really
1/8/16, 13:02 - Mom: neuron
1/8/16, 13:02 - Cindy L: cool
1/8/16, 13:02 - Cindy L: that's pretty interesting.
1/8/16, 13:02 - Cindy L: u know apparently some mattresses have synthetic estrogens
1/8/16, 13:02 - Mom: mattress?
1/8/16, 13:02 - Cindy L: there's a lot of synthetic estrogen around everywhere
1/8/16, 13:02 - Mom: which one?
1/8/16, 13:02 - Cindy L: water
1/8/16, 13:02 - Cindy L: dunno
1/8/16, 13:02 - Cindy L: i just read
1/8/16, 13:03 - Cindy L: chickens
1/8/16, 13:03 - Cindy L: apparently fish and frogs are becoming intersex because of contamination of water with synthetic estrogens
1/8/16, 13:04 - Cindy L: eek
1/8/16, 13:04 - Cindy L: and we are also eating this stuff btw
1/8/16, 13:04 - Mom: u mean ÊâìÈáùÈõû
1/8/16, 13:04 - Cindy L: i bet china has a lot of this contaminatino
1/8/16, 13:04 - Cindy L: yea
1/8/16, 13:05 - Mom: sigh.....
1/8/16, 13:05 - Mom: that's why i bought sadia chicken wings
1/8/16, 13:05 - Cindy L: oh wow
1/8/16, 13:05 - Cindy L: plastics like BPA, petroleum based products, detergents, cosmetics, furniture, carpeting, thermal receipts and on our food from agriculture chemicals like pesticides, herbicides and fungicides
1/8/16, 13:05 - Cindy L: that's everything
1/8/16, 13:05 - Cindy L: man
1/8/16, 13:06 - Cindy L: it causes cancers
1/8/16, 13:06 - Mom: u can find lots of things made in china in usa. uk
1/8/16, 13:06 - Cindy L: i wonder if it also affects immune system
1/8/16, 13:06 - Cindy L: thats true
1/8/16, 13:06 - Cindy L: i think there's more in the us
1/8/16, 13:06 - Cindy L: uk not so much cuz its cheaper to import from europe
1/8/16, 13:07 - Mom: especially when u bought stuff from amazon.com
1/8/16, 13:08 - Mom: did u eat the egg noodle i gave u when i left uk in oct?
1/8/16, 13:08 - Mom: they're so delicious
1/8/16, 13:08 - Cindy L: what no
1/8/16, 13:08 - Cindy L: i can't figure what to cook them with
1/8/16, 13:08 - Mom: i cook it in my Êµ∑Â∏∂ÊπØ
1/8/16, 13:08 - Cindy L: .....
1/8/16, 13:09 - Cindy L: that's like having pasta
1/8/16, 13:09 - Mom: that tastes rlly good
1/8/16, 13:09 - Cindy L: i cooked them with chilli sauce once that was ok
1/8/16, 13:09 - Mom: no, like ramen
1/8/16, 13:10 - Cindy L: ramen needs dashi soup
1/8/16, 13:10 - Cindy L: omg last time i spend ages on that ramen
1/8/16, 13:10 - Mom: but my Êµ∑Â∏∂ÊπØ is good
1/8/16, 13:10 - Cindy L: okay sure
1/8/16, 13:10 - Cindy L: try miso soup
1/8/16, 13:10 - Cindy L: apparently that's also good
1/8/16, 13:10 - Cindy L: cuz its fermented
1/8/16, 13:11 - Cindy L: i think i left half a box of miso
1/8/16, 13:11 - Cindy L: actually anything korean is pretty healthy....
1/8/16, 13:11 - Cindy L: whaaa
1/8/16, 13:11 - Cindy L: good to be korean then
1/8/16, 13:11 - Cindy L: too bad their makeup sucks.
1/8/16, 13:11 - Mom: yea, i just thought why the koreans don't have eczema
1/8/16, 13:12 - Cindy L: i'm pretty sure there are koreans with skin problems.
1/8/16, 13:12 - Cindy L: it's like a genetic defect.
1/8/16, 13:13 - Mom: then u better not go with the brits cuz there're hugh cases of eczema, mysterious health problems in uk
1/8/16, 13:13 - Cindy L: that's true
1/8/16, 13:14 - Cindy L: but to be honest they are quite healthy here
1/8/16, 13:14 - Cindy L: i mean fruit and veg
1/8/16, 13:14 - Cindy L: not too much meat.
1/8/16, 13:14 - Cindy L: maybe too much beer.
1/8/16, 13:14 - Cindy L: yeah
1/8/16, 13:14 - Mom: but still have too much genetic prob
1/8/16, 13:14 - Cindy L: definitely too much booze.
1/8/16, 13:14 - Cindy L: and smoking
1/8/16, 13:14 - Mom: well, i don't think beer is that harmful
1/8/16, 13:15 - Cindy L: exercise is pretty popular
1/8/16, 13:15 - Cindy L: then i dunno
1/8/16, 13:15 - Cindy L: i don't get it
1/8/16, 13:15 - Cindy L: hard water?
1/8/16, 13:15 - Mom: koreans also smoke a lot
1/8/16, 13:15 - Cindy L: that's true
1/8/16, 13:15 - Cindy L: so not smoking.
1/8/16, 13:15 - Cindy L: koreans drink soju
1/8/16, 13:15 - Cindy L: that's from potatoes
1/8/16, 13:15 - Mom: üëè
1/8/16, 13:15 - Cindy L: wheat.
1/8/16, 13:15 - Cindy L: probably wheat.
1/8/16, 13:16 - Cindy L: wheat is like super gmo
1/8/16, 13:16 - Cindy L: crop
1/8/16, 13:16 - Cindy L: plus gluten is not good
1/8/16, 13:16 - Mom: don't know
1/8/16, 13:16 - Cindy L: beer is from wheat
1/8/16, 13:17 - Mom: but aren't they fermented?
1/8/16, 13:17 - Cindy L: yes but still wheat
1/8/16, 13:17 - Cindy L: and wheat is super gmo like i said
1/8/16, 13:17 - Cindy L: gmo crops can lead to genetic changes in the body.
1/8/16, 13:17 - Cindy L: apparently.
1/8/16, 13:20 - Cindy L: but whatever. that only affects the population
1/8/16, 13:20 - Cindy L: once u have mutation, u're pretty much stuck
1/8/16, 13:21 - Mom: always have a connection prob these days üëø
1/8/16, 13:22 - Cindy L: oh yea its my wifi
1/8/16, 13:22 - Mom: no, its the wifi at home
1/8/16, 13:22 - Cindy L: no they renew the connection like every 15 mins
1/8/16, 13:22 - Mom: u mean urs?
1/8/16, 13:22 - Cindy L: yea
1/8/16, 13:23 - Mom: but the wifi here actually is having prob everyday
1/8/16, 13:23 - Cindy L: ok go blow up pccw
1/8/16, 13:23 - Cindy L: the indian girl is back
1/8/16, 13:23 - Cindy L: she brought a pressure cooker
1/8/16, 13:24 - Mom: i wish but we've contract
1/8/16, 13:24 - Cindy L: üò®
1/8/16, 13:24 - Mom: she knows how to use it?
1/8/16, 13:24 - Cindy L: üò∞
1/8/16, 13:24 - Cindy L: u know they ban pressure cookers in imperial dorms
1/8/16, 13:24 - Mom: üòÇ
1/8/16, 13:24 - Cindy L: cuz u can make a pretty good bomb out of one
1/8/16, 13:25 - Mom: man, the pressure cooker is like a bomb
1/8/16, 13:25 - Cindy L: no like a literal bomb
1/8/16, 13:25 - Cindy L: the boston bombing was a pressure cooker bobm
1/8/16, 13:26 - Mom: do u have these kind of rules there in high holborn hall?
1/8/16, 13:26 - Cindy L: i dunno
1/8/16, 13:26 - Cindy L: maybe
1/8/16, 13:26 - Mom: do u have to check with the man downstairs?
1/8/16, 13:26 - Cindy L: probably....
1/8/16, 13:26 - Mom: i advise u to do so b4 having regrets....
1/8/16, 13:26 - Cindy L: and i thought people are worried about suicide bombers.
1/8/16, 13:27 - Cindy L: yea i'm kinda worried....
1/8/16, 13:27 - Mom: u know that girl can't even do anything
1/8/16, 13:27 - Cindy L: yeah but u need to like deliberately cook explosives for it  to be a bomb
1/8/16, 13:27 - Mom: she might mistakenly do something
1/8/16, 13:27 - Cindy L: but what if like someone else took the thing and made a bomb
1/8/16, 13:28 - Cindy L: i mean i can't be the only person who knows this.
1/8/16, 13:28 - Cindy L: i think i'll go ask later just to be safe.....
1/8/16, 13:29 - Mom: better play safe
1/8/16, 13:29 - Cindy L: esp with isis bombings and shit
1/8/16, 13:29 - Mom: oh yea
1/8/16, 13:30 - Mom: so better play safe
1/8/16, 13:30 - Mom: u might have mistakenly saved lots of lives
1/8/16, 13:35 - Cindy L: i just don't wanna be blown up myself.
1/8/16, 13:37 - Mom: üò®üò®
1/8/16, 19:22 - Cindy L: so i was looking at american transfer on college confidential
1/8/16, 19:22 - Cindy L: seems like lots of people transfer cuz they don't like being in the middle of nowhere
1/8/16, 19:22 - Cindy L: lol
1/8/16, 19:23 - Cindy L: that's definitely a worse reason than mine
1/8/16, 19:24 - Mom: transfer to where?
1/8/16, 19:25 - Cindy L: like there's this person asking about transfer from cmu to nyu
1/8/16, 19:27 - Mom: then that's their reason?
1/8/16, 19:27 - Cindy L: yea u don't really need a reason
1/8/16, 19:27 - Cindy L: i can't believe this person is transferring out of cmu comp sci
1/8/16, 19:27 - Cindy L: but hey i'm transferring out of lse econ gov
1/8/16, 19:27 - Cindy L: so who am i to say
1/8/16, 19:27 - Mom: what?
1/8/16, 19:27 - Cindy L: carnegie mellon comp sci
1/8/16, 19:28 - Cindy L: its no.1 in the country
1/8/16, 19:28 - Mom: i know
1/8/16, 19:28 - Mom: but they might have their reason like not suitable
1/8/16, 19:29 - Cindy L: no this person's reason is that they prefer to live in new york city.
1/8/16, 19:29 - Cindy L: fair enough
1/8/16, 19:30 - Mom: he might not want to do comp sci
1/8/16, 19:30 - Mom: ta
1/8/16, 19:30 - Cindy L: people on the thread are recommending him to transfer to mit
1/8/16, 19:30 - Cindy L: so i think he is doing comp sci
1/8/16, 19:30 - Mom: but mit isn't in ny
1/8/16, 19:30 - Cindy L: apparently columbia seas is easy to transfer into though
1/8/16, 19:31 - Cindy L: but columbia engineering is so socially focused.... blerg
1/8/16, 19:31 - Mom: what is socially focused?
1/8/16, 19:31 - Cindy L: like
1/8/16, 19:32 - Cindy L: how to build strong houses in developing countries
1/8/16, 19:32 - Cindy L: how to get clean water to devleoping countries
1/8/16, 19:32 - Cindy L: that stuff
1/8/16, 19:32 - Cindy L: not innovation focused.
1/8/16, 19:32 - Cindy L: cmu has a brain hub which is interesting.
1/8/16, 19:32 - Mom: tha looks like environmental engrg
1/8/16, 19:32 - Cindy L: yea that sort
1/8/16, 19:33 - Cindy L: columbia is like super lib
1/8/16, 19:33 - Cindy L: u know
1/8/16, 19:33 - Mom: who cares.
1/8/16, 19:33 - Cindy L: ikr
1/8/16, 19:34 - Mom: so where u want to try?
1/8/16, 19:34 - Cindy L: so apparently only berkeley is the impossible one to transfer into
1/8/16, 19:35 - Cindy L: tbh city life is important to me too.
1/8/16, 19:37 - Mom: american wants to go to city bc there lots of opportunities
1/8/16, 19:39 - Cindy L: yea i see
1/8/16, 19:40 - Cindy L: but new york there's only nyu and columbia
1/8/16, 19:42 - Mom: both r famous and good uni right
1/8/16, 19:42 - Cindy L: nyu?
1/8/16, 19:42 - Cindy L: only tsich is
1/8/16, 19:43 - Cindy L: honestly i'm looking at them
1/8/16, 19:43 - Cindy L: i prefer design engineering.
1/8/16, 19:44 - Mom: tsich? what is it?
1/8/16, 19:44 - Cindy L: school of arts and film
1/8/16, 19:45 - Mom: in usa, they call it school of engineering and tech instead of design engineering
1/8/16, 19:46 - Cindy L: yeah
1/8/16, 19:46 - Cindy L: well i got waitlisted for carnegie mellon
1/8/16, 19:46 - Cindy L: even though i didn't write anything about it
1/8/16, 19:46 - Mom: if u go to design engrg, ur going to technician training school
1/8/16, 19:47 - Cindy L: should have gone to architecture after all.
1/8/16, 19:47 - Mom: last yr?
1/8/16, 19:47 - Cindy L: hahhaha
1/8/16, 19:47 - Mom: no way
1/8/16, 19:47 - Cindy L: and switch from there
1/8/16, 19:48 - Cindy L: not pay 70000 usd
1/8/16, 19:48 - Cindy L: that's cray cray
1/8/16, 19:48 - Mom: if u go to arch, that might be total waste of time
1/8/16, 19:48 - Cindy L: georgia tech is quite cheap
1/8/16, 19:48 - Cindy L: only 27600
1/8/16, 19:49 - Mom: what uni?
1/8/16, 19:49 - Cindy L: georgia tech
1/8/16, 19:49 - Mom: good?
1/8/16, 19:49 - Cindy L: caltech has an entrance exam what the hell
1/8/16, 19:50 - Cindy L: sorry wait i can't transfer to tech schools
1/8/16, 19:50 - Mom: can't apply for transfe
1/8/16, 19:50 - Cindy L: cuz they don't have social sciences
1/8/16, 19:52 - Cindy L: yea
1/8/16, 19:52 - Cindy L: and mit is for super ambitious people
1/8/16, 19:52 - Cindy L: so that rules me out
1/8/16, 19:52 - Cindy L: i have different perspective of columbia and mit now.
1/8/16, 19:52 - Mom: u can apply for transfer to a uni with tech subj as electives?
1/8/16, 19:53 - Cindy L: what do you mean?
1/8/16, 19:53 - Cindy L: some say they require u to have taken comp sci courses in 1st yr
1/8/16, 19:53 - Cindy L: or to have been majoring in engineering or related disciplines
1/8/16, 19:56 - Mom: but isn't it that the first two yrs in american uni just study common core subj, they only hv their majors from third yr?
1/8/16, 19:56 - Cindy L: not all
1/8/16, 19:56 - Cindy L: all unis are a bit different
1/8/16, 19:56 - Cindy L: and for engine majors, they require to take like fundamentals in 1st and 2nd yrs
1/8/16, 19:57 - Cindy L: like maths, physics and calc and comp sci
1/8/16, 19:57 - Cindy L: those module
1/8/16, 19:57 - Cindy L: s
1/8/16, 19:57 - Cindy L: which i don't have
1/8/16, 19:57 - Cindy L: their credit requirements are also usually for those subjects
1/8/16, 19:57 - Mom: yea that's ur prob
1/8/16, 19:58 - Mom: bc lse study only 4 courses
1/8/16, 19:58 - Cindy L: yea
1/8/16, 20:01 - Cindy L: lol stanford is so wtf
1/8/16, 20:02 - Mom: what abt u penn?
1/8/16, 20:02 - Cindy L: upenn is worse than cmu
1/8/16, 20:03 - Cindy L: and columbia
1/8/16, 20:03 - Mom: but elon musk went there b4
1/8/16, 20:03 - Cindy L: but its in the middle of nowhee
1/8/16, 20:03 - Mom: hahaha

1/8/16, 20:06 - Cindy L: its 10 pound for everything
1/8/16, 20:06 - Cindy L: its a blanket fee apparently
1/8/16, 20:06 - Cindy L: so everyone is charged
1/8/16, 20:06 - Cindy L: whether u have appliances or not
1/8/16, 20:06 - Cindy L: great

1/8/16, 20:07 - Mom: then the indian girl's pressure cooker must fail
1/8/16, 20:08 - Cindy L: pressure cookers don't have plugs
1/8/16, 20:08 - Cindy L: its not an electrical appliance
1/8/16, 20:09 - Cindy L: brb i'm going out

1/8/16, 22:02 - Cindy L: so i discovered hot dogs are great
1/8/16, 22:02 - Cindy L: cuz they have very low marginal cost
1/8/16, 22:02 - Cindy L: so do oats
1/8/16, 22:03 - Cindy L: so they should make porridge and hot dogs to feed the poor
1/9/16, 02:09 - Mom: üëè
1/9/16, 02:10 - Mom: üëç
1/9/16, 04:54 - Mom: now i know why ur dad always eats hot dogs and porridge at Cafe de Coral!!!

1/9/16, 08:19 - Cindy L: I went to the shop yesterday and even the cashier said I look tired
1/9/16, 08:19 - Cindy L: Or maybe I just look bored?
1/9/16, 08:28 - Mom: ur eyes look no focus, that's why ppl wud say u look tired
1/9/16, 08:30 - Cindy L: Oh I hv dead eyes then

1/10/16, 17:06 - Mom: but u said that's expensive, right?
1/10/16, 17:06 - Cindy L: 30pp per month
1/10/16, 17:07 - Mom: 30pp/month actually is not that expensive if u go everyday and u don't have to pay extra using their facilities
1/10/16, 17:07 - Cindy L: yea
1/10/16, 17:07 - Cindy L: but i already paid for all the other sports au stuff
1/10/16, 17:07 - Cindy L: that's why i should have just joined the gym in the first place
1/10/16, 17:08 - Mom: how much is that?
1/10/16, 17:08 - Cindy L: all the sport societies
1/10/16, 17:08 - Cindy L: ?
1/10/16, 17:08 - Cindy L: i dunno
1/10/16, 17:08 - Mom: once or monthly payment?
1/10/16, 17:08 - Cindy L: one
1/10/16, 17:08 - Cindy L: once
1/10/16, 17:08 - Cindy L: except tkd
1/10/16, 17:08 - Cindy L: hv to pay per lesson
1/10/16, 17:09 - Mom: what abt others? hv to pay per lesson?
1/10/16, 17:09 - Cindy L: no
1/10/16, 17:09 - Cindy L: once
1/10/16, 17:09 - Cindy L: done
1/10/16, 17:09 - Cindy L: after trying so many sports
1/10/16, 17:09 - Cindy L: i think
1/10/16, 17:09 - Cindy L: swimming is the best
1/10/16, 17:10 - Mom: so u can enjoy that particulary sport after trial free of charge?
1/10/16, 17:10 - Cindy L: no
1/10/16, 17:10 - Cindy L: cuz they don't have a professional coach
1/10/16, 17:10 - Cindy L: so u pay for booking venue
1/10/16, 17:11 - Mom: so ur just paying for that trial session in the beginning
1/10/16, 17:11 - Cindy L: what do mean trial?
1/10/16, 17:11 - Mom: how many  u tried?
1/10/16, 17:11 - Cindy L: there's no trial
1/10/16, 17:11 - Cindy L: or u don't have to pay for trail
1/10/16, 17:11 - Cindy L: trial
1/10/16, 17:11 - Mom: u said u pay for the sports club once and did the trial session only once
1/10/16, 17:12 - Cindy L: no
1/10/16, 17:12 - Cindy L: what are you talking about?
1/10/16, 17:12 - Cindy L: i said u only need to pay once
1/10/16, 17:12 - Mom: but u hv paid for the societies
1/10/16, 17:12 - Cindy L: and u can attend for the year
1/10/16, 17:12 - Cindy L: yea u need to contribute to society funds
1/10/16, 17:12 - Mom: free of charge?
1/10/16, 17:12 - Cindy L: its a full year membership
1/10/16, 17:13 - Cindy L: once u pay membership u can attend trainings
1/10/16, 17:13 - Mom: after that u don't hv to pay for subsequent activities?
1/10/16, 17:13 - Cindy L: ok
1/10/16, 17:13 - Cindy L: no
1/10/16, 17:13 - Cindy L: tkd is the only except because they have a professional tkd instructor to teach classes
1/10/16, 17:14 - Cindy L: so u have to pay for each individual class as well
1/10/16, 17:14 - Cindy L: but if u only need to pay membership fee, then those sports are run by studens
1/10/16, 17:14 - Mom: i know
1/10/16, 17:15 - Cindy L: good
1/10/16, 17:15 - Mom: but if u still want to play those sports, u hv to pay for the venue booking fee, right?
1/10/16, 17:15 - Cindy L: no
1/10/16, 17:15 - Cindy L: membership covers the venue booking fee
1/10/16, 17:15 - Cindy L: that's why u have to pay membership in the first place, cuz we have no facilities
1/10/16, 17:16 - Mom: how much is the mbrship fee?
1/10/16, 17:16 - Cindy L: like 50 pounds
1/10/16, 17:16 - Cindy L: its more expensive than regular societies
1/10/16, 17:16 - Cindy L: cuz of this fact
1/10/16, 17:16 - Mom: how many 50pp u hv paid?
1/10/16, 17:17 - Cindy L: 2
1/10/16, 17:17 - Cindy L: i guess its not too much
1/10/16, 17:17 - Cindy L: that's equivalent  to about 3 months of gym fees.
1/10/16, 17:17 - Mom: let's say if u join a gym, the annual cost = 30 x 12 = 360pp
1/10/16, 17:18 - Cindy L: yea
1/10/16, 17:18 - Mom: but that equiv. 3 months gym fees was a total waste
1/10/16, 17:18 - Cindy L: no cuz i go to do the sports.
1/10/16, 17:19 - Cindy L: u can't do volleyball or archery at the gym
1/10/16, 17:19 - Mom: ur still going?
1/10/16, 17:19 - Cindy L: yea
1/10/16, 17:19 - Mom: fine
1/10/16, 17:19 - Cindy L: but my point is just that they are not very helpful in terms of weigh loss.
1/10/16, 17:20 - Mom: hahaha
1/10/16, 17:21 - Cindy L: so should i join the gym
1/10/16, 17:21 - Cindy L: just to swim
1/10/16, 17:21 - Cindy L: what the hell
1/10/16, 17:21 - Mom: to loss weigh, u got to hv a program
1/10/16, 17:21 - Cindy L: no u just need to do aerobic exercise
1/10/16, 17:21 - Mom: not just joining the gym, u got to hv a coach and a plan for weigh loss
1/10/16, 17:22 - Mom: do u think u hv that serious commitment?
1/10/16, 17:22 - Mom: no offence
1/10/16, 17:22 - Cindy L: no u just need to swim 3 times a week
1/10/16, 17:22 - Cindy L: and eat less
1/10/16, 17:22 - Cindy L: u know swimming burns a lot of calories?
1/10/16, 17:23 - Cindy L: and u need to do it often
1/10/16, 17:23 - Cindy L: not longer period
1/10/16, 17:23 - Mom: then u need to wash ur hair every other day and ur skin wud become dry?
1/10/16, 17:24 - Cindy L: hahaha no i just cream more.
1/10/16, 17:24 - Mom: can u join the gym on a monthly basis?
1/10/16, 17:24 - Cindy L: yea i think
1/10/16, 17:25 - Mom: make sure u don't hv to sign some annual contract
1/10/16, 17:26 - Cindy L: yea
1/10/16, 17:26 - Cindy L: i quit my economist subscription too
1/10/16, 17:26 - Mom: why?
1/10/16, 17:26 - Cindy L: cuz that was a waste of time
1/10/16, 17:26 - Mom: boring?
1/10/16, 17:26 - Cindy L: i never read them
1/10/16, 17:26 - Mom: actually u don't hv time to read them
1/10/16, 17:26 - Cindy L: no i just don't read them
1/10/16, 17:27 - Mom: that means ur actually not interested in econ
1/10/16, 17:28 - Cindy L: i was just wondering whether my level of drowsiness after eating is normal
1/10/16, 17:28 - Mom: what level?
1/10/16, 17:29 - Cindy L: like i need to nap
1/10/16, 17:29 - Cindy L: and my body just falls asleep
1/10/16, 17:29 - Cindy L: its not 'a little tired'
1/10/16, 17:29 - Mom: u don't hv to b4?
1/10/16, 17:29 - Cindy L: its like 'i'm so drowsy i'm bloody drunk'
1/10/16, 17:30 - Cindy L: before all these shenanigans ofc
1/10/16, 17:31 - Mom: shenanigans?
1/10/16, 17:31 - Cindy L: stuff
1/10/16, 17:31 - Cindy L: i'm like an elderly person
1/10/16, 17:31 - Cindy L: gotta sleep after lunch
1/10/16, 17:31 - Mom: ur afraid that u hv dermentia?
1/10/16, 17:32 - Cindy L: why? no
1/10/16, 17:32 - Cindy L: u know why old people sleep after lunch?
1/10/16, 17:32 - Cindy L: cuz their blood flow redirects to their gut to digest the crap they eat
1/10/16, 17:32 - Mom: when do these incidents start?
1/10/16, 17:32 - Cindy L: so blood pressure decreases
1/10/16, 17:32 - Cindy L: but that's ONLY if u have a bad heart
1/10/16, 17:33 - Cindy L: i certainly do not have a bad heart.
1/10/16, 17:33 - Mom: but this theory is applicable to every one even the young persons
1/10/16, 17:33 - Cindy L: no harvard med says its RARE in yp
1/10/16, 17:34 - Cindy L: and normal people do not get so tired they need to take a nap
1/10/16, 17:34 - Mom: think of the lesson after lunch, even students want to nap in class
1/10/16, 17:35 - Cindy L: yeah u see the difference
1/10/16, 17:35 - Cindy L: they WANT to nap
1/10/16, 17:35 - Cindy L: i HAVE  to nap
1/10/16, 17:35 - Cindy L: even if i have a coffe
1/10/16, 17:35 - Mom: since when?
1/10/16, 17:36 - Cindy L: what do mean since when?
1/10/16, 17:36 - Mom: from what time, u feel u HAVE to nap after eating something?
1/10/16, 17:37 - Cindy L: when it started?
1/10/16, 17:37 - Cindy L: last jan
1/10/16, 17:38 - Mom: when ur back to uk from hk?
1/10/16, 17:38 - Cindy L: no
1/10/16, 17:38 - Cindy L: jan 2015
1/10/16, 17:38 - Cindy L: if u think abt it
1/10/16, 17:38 - Mom: after having two sessions of ivig?
1/10/16, 17:38 - Cindy L: after dinner i always collapsed outside sam yeung
1/10/16, 17:39 - Mom: still the same feeling now after meal?
1/10/16, 17:39 - Cindy L: so assuming collapses are due to the body slipping into rem mode
1/10/16, 17:41 - Cindy L: i was thinking that
1/10/16, 17:42 - Cindy L: rather than decrease in blood pressure
1/10/16, 17:42 - Cindy L: it is that once the food is metabolised it produces a sleeping inducing neurotransmitter
1/10/16, 17:42 - Cindy L: which seems more plausible
1/10/16, 17:42 - Cindy L: cuz its not simply lightheadedness
1/10/16, 17:43 - Cindy L: so there is similarity between the drowsiness i feel now and the collapsing episodes one yr ago
1/10/16, 17:44 - Mom: still collapsing after meals?
1/10/16, 17:44 - Cindy L: no not anymore
1/10/16, 17:44 - Cindy L: so u see how drowsiness and the collapsing one year ago is related?
1/10/16, 17:45 - Mom: but what do u mean by "similarity between the drowsiness now and the collapsing a year ago?"
1/10/16, 17:45 - Cindy L: like i'm trying to saw
1/10/16, 17:46 - Cindy L: say
1/10/16, 17:46 - Cindy L: that these two seemingly unrelated events
1/10/16, 17:46 - Cindy L: are
1/10/16, 17:46 - Cindy L: caused by the same principle
1/10/16, 17:46 - Mom: u think so?
1/10/16, 17:46 - Cindy L: metabolisation of certain creates a sleeping inducing neurotransmitter
1/10/16, 17:46 - Cindy L: certain food
1/10/16, 17:47 - Mom: where did u learn that?
1/10/16, 17:47 - Cindy L: deduction
1/10/16, 17:47 - Mom: but i never read something like that, ofc just from online readings
1/10/16, 17:48 - Cindy L: yeah but u're never gonna read something like this online
1/10/16, 17:48 - Cindy L: cuz this is case specific
1/10/16, 17:48 - Cindy L: or else everyone would be like zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz all the freaking time
1/10/16, 17:49 - Mom: no, i try different systems, i mean the human body
1/10/16, 17:49 - Cindy L: and obesity would be resolved cuz u can't eat that much if u want to stay awake
1/10/16, 17:49 - Cindy L: ?
1/10/16, 17:49 - Cindy L: don't understand
1/10/16, 17:50 - Mom: how often u take nap now?
1/10/16, 17:50 - Mom: or forced to take nap
1/10/16, 17:51 - Mom: i mean did u sleep involuntarily often
1/10/16, 17:51 - Mom: for the past week
1/10/16, 17:51 - Cindy L: not really
1/10/16, 17:51 - Cindy L: just after meal most noticeably
1/10/16, 17:51 - Cindy L: after large meal
1/10/16, 17:51 - Cindy L: and
1/10/16, 17:51 - Cindy L: in some special cases
1/10/16, 17:52 - Cindy L: which involves seizures
1/10/16, 17:52 - Mom: how long that nap lasts for? a couple of mins or an hour?
1/10/16, 17:53 - Cindy L: all different
1/10/16, 17:53 - Cindy L: i'm looking at them individually
1/10/16, 17:54 - Cindy L: so after meal i definitely lose consciousness (so this is easier to understand)
1/10/16, 17:54 - Cindy L: the other two i dunno if i'm conscious or not
1/10/16, 17:55 - Mom: i mean the duration napping
1/10/16, 17:55 - Mom: the level of consciousness
1/10/16, 17:55 - Mom: not the level of consciousness
1/10/16, 17:57 - Cindy L: couple of mins
1/10/16, 17:57 - Cindy L: from 5 mins - 30 mins?
1/10/16, 17:57 - Mom: it seems normal woo
1/10/16, 17:58 - Cindy L: u mean after lunch?
1/10/16, 17:59 - Mom: yea
1/10/16, 17:59 - Cindy L: after lunch naps are definitely not normal
1/10/16, 17:59 - Cindy L: u know how u get drowsy after taking flu meds?
1/10/16, 17:59 - Cindy L: its that feeling
1/10/16, 17:59 - Cindy L: no
1/10/16, 17:59 - Cindy L: not
1/10/16, 17:59 - Cindy L: lightheadness or fatigue
1/10/16, 17:59 - Cindy L: it's clearly drowsiness
1/10/16, 17:59 - Mom: but i read so many from online saying that this is normal woo
1/10/16, 18:00 - Cindy L: online sources say
1/10/16, 18:00 - Cindy L: fatigue is normal
1/10/16, 18:00 - Cindy L: not drowsiness
1/10/16, 18:00 - Mom: flu meds are seductive ma
1/10/16, 18:01 - Cindy L: sedative
1/10/16, 18:01 - Cindy L: yeah like i'm saying its a sedative feeling
1/10/16, 18:01 - Cindy L: not simply fatigue
1/10/16, 18:01 - Mom: sorry, wrong spelling
1/10/16, 18:01 - Cindy L: ~sigh
1/10/16, 18:02 - Mom: flu meds actually contains sedative chemicals, but u neve wud have sedative chemicals in ur food, right?
1/10/16, 18:04 - Mom: are u saying that u feel drowsy after having meals instead of sleepy?
1/10/16, 18:06 - Cindy L: Yes but I'm saying metabolization produces sedative chemicals or chemicals which my body registers as 'go to sleep'
1/10/16, 18:07 - Cindy L: As in when the food is broken down, these chemicals are produced
1/10/16, 18:07 - Cindy L: Which would suggest a food allergy or intolerance
1/10/16, 18:10 - Mom: i get ur point but i told u that i've googled a lot "sleepy after meals" b4 and didn't come across anything like what u said
1/10/16, 18:11 - Cindy L: YES
1/10/16, 18:11 - Cindy L: because EDS is not common
1/10/16, 18:11 - Cindy L: my disorder does not apply to every freaking individual on the planet
1/10/16, 18:11 - Cindy L: it is a DISORDER
1/10/16, 18:12 - Cindy L: its not sleepy
1/10/16, 18:12 - Cindy L: its drowsy btw
1/10/16, 18:12 - Mom: actually, ur disorder is not like usual narco case
1/10/16, 18:12 - Cindy L: yea i know
1/10/16, 18:13 - Cindy L: which is why u must understand the whole thing from looking at the basic mechanism
1/10/16, 18:13 - Cindy L: debugging, okay?
1/10/16, 18:13 - Mom: btw, do u feel like recovered from illness after napping?
1/10/16, 18:13 - Cindy L: what do u mean?
1/10/16, 18:13 - Cindy L: what is this recovered from illness feeling?
1/10/16, 18:14 - Mom: regain strength
1/10/16, 18:14 - Mom: not refresh
1/10/16, 18:14 - Cindy L: ....
1/10/16, 18:14 - Cindy L: don't get it
1/10/16, 18:15 - Cindy L: no particular feeling
1/10/16, 18:15 - Cindy L: just like after napping
1/10/16, 18:16 - Mom: u know when ur sick, ur muscles become weak and when u get well, u feel more energized
1/10/16, 18:16 - Cindy L: er no
1/10/16, 18:16 - Cindy L: nothing like that
1/10/16, 18:17 - Cindy L: btw is orexin sleep inducing or inhabiting?
1/10/16, 18:18 - Mom: orexin level high = more awake
1/10/16, 18:18 - Mom: and vice versa
1/10/16, 18:18 - Cindy L: ok
1/10/16, 18:18 - Cindy L: whats the difference between orexin a and orexin b
1/10/16, 18:19 - Mom: two types of orexins
1/10/16, 18:19 - Mom: they exist in ur brain and ur gut in different proportion
1/10/16, 18:19 - Cindy L: and
1/10/16, 18:20 - Mom: also 80% of the orexins exist in ur gut
1/10/16, 18:20 - Cindy L: what is the ratio of orexin a and b in the gut?
1/10/16, 18:20 - Cindy L: are they like
1/10/16, 18:20 - Cindy L: isotopes?
1/10/16, 18:21 - Cindy L: like two different versions of the same thing?
1/10/16, 18:21 - Mom: can't remember exactly 1:4
1/10/16, 18:21 - Cindy L: okay so there is generally more orexin b
1/10/16, 18:23 - Mom: a and b have different no. of amino acids
1/10/16, 18:24 - Mom: orexin A is said to be more important
1/10/16, 18:24 - Cindy L: yeah i assume they're a bit like isotopes
1/10/16, 18:24 - Cindy L: like similar versions of basically the same thing
1/10/16, 18:25 - Mom: well they're all amino acids in ur brain but with a bit different formation
1/10/16, 18:25 - Cindy L: k
1/10/16, 18:25 - Cindy L: though
1/10/16, 18:26 - Cindy L: u have to agree with me that the cataplexy eps from jan 2015 and post meal drowsiness is linked right?
1/10/16, 18:26 - Mom: no idea
1/10/16, 18:27 - Cindy L: they're both cases where the body is getting the signal to slip into rem mode?
1/10/16, 18:27 - Cindy L: u agree that cataplexy is the body slipping into rem right?
1/10/16, 18:28 - Mom: sort of
1/10/16, 18:28 - Cindy L: okay thats good
1/10/16, 18:28 - Cindy L: so jan 2015 - likely to switch to rem after meal
1/10/16, 18:29 - Cindy L: now - likely to switch to rem after meal
1/10/16, 18:29 - Cindy L: see the link
1/10/16, 18:29 - Mom: i get ur point but ...
1/10/16, 18:30 - Mom: now after meal, ur drowsy and have to nap
1/10/16, 18:31 - Mom: ru conscious when ur napping?
1/10/16, 18:31 - Cindy L: i know its changed form
1/10/16, 18:31 - Cindy L: why?
1/10/16, 18:32 - Cindy L: that's what we're investigating
1/10/16, 18:32 - Mom: that's why i'm not convinced that ur disorder now is classified as narco!!!
1/10/16, 18:33 - Cindy L: yea its probably not narco
1/10/16, 18:33 - Mom: can u show me ur sleep pattern for the last week?
1/10/16, 18:33 - Cindy L: or like
1/10/16, 18:33 - Cindy L: it's a variation of narco
1/10/16, 18:33 - Cindy L: cuz the orexin neurons aren't destroyed.
1/10/16, 18:38 - Mom: 3 days sleep record only?
1/10/16, 18:44 - Cindy L: yeah no data for other two days
1/10/16, 18:44 - Mom: what u didn't sleep?
1/10/16, 18:44 - Cindy L: sure
1/10/16, 18:44 - Cindy L: hahah
1/10/16, 18:44 - Cindy L: it doesn't detect sometimes duh
1/10/16, 18:44 - Cindy L: not sure why
1/10/16, 18:45 - Mom: wow, that device isn't reliable
1/10/16, 18:45 - Cindy L: yeah new tech is like that
1/10/16, 18:45 - Mom: how much u paid for it?

1/10/16, 18:48 - Cindy L: see human nature tends towards chaos

1/10/16, 18:50 - Cindy L: market with some government regulation
1/10/16, 18:50 - Cindy L: its centre left.

1/10/16, 18:51 - Mom: no way, can't believe that
1/10/16, 18:51 - Cindy L: economy wise it is
1/10/16, 18:52 - Cindy L: they just differ in the human rights and legal bits
1/10/16, 18:52 - Mom: just in theory, right?
1/10/16, 18:53 - Cindy L: Social capital refers to the institutions, relationships, and norms that shape the quality and quantity of a society's social interactions. Increasing evidence shows that social cohesion is critical for societies to prosper economically and for development to be sustainable.
1/10/16, 18:53 - Cindy L: oooh
1/10/16, 18:53 - Cindy L: i see

1/10/16, 18:55 - Mom: just a bunch of meaningless concepts/words
1/10/16, 18:55 - Cindy L: u know fdrs' new deal is modelled after the soviets?
1/10/16, 18:55 - Cindy L: cuz they saw how they were modernising so fast with their five yr plans

1/10/16, 18:59 - Mom: sodium oxybate is very dangerous
1/10/16, 18:59 - Cindy L: obiviously they don't fix anything permanently

1/10/16, 19:02 - Cindy L: i need to find someway to fix the muscle atonia.
1/10/16, 19:02 - Mom: but definitely not antidepressants
1/10/16, 19:03 - Cindy L: i looked at isolated cases
1/10/16, 19:03 - Cindy L: and antidepressants don't seem to be very effective.
1/10/16, 19:03 - Cindy L: so i agree

1/10/16, 19:39 - Mom: that's for insoma, i just google it
1/10/16, 19:42 - Mom: looks not suitable for u cuz the side effects include: daytime drowsiness, weak legs, forgetful, weird dreams
1/10/16, 19:45 - Cindy L: Haha
1/10/16, 19:46 - Cindy L: Everything I already hv
1/10/16, 19:46 - Mom: ur forgetful now?
1/10/16, 19:46 - Cindy L: Aside from that
1/10/16, 19:47 - Cindy L: though
1/10/16, 19:47 - Cindy L: maybe
1/10/16, 19:47 - Cindy L: i couldn't remember the graphs i drew for econ in the test
1/10/16, 19:47 - Mom: that's why is told u that drug not suitable for u
1/10/16, 19:47 - Cindy L: although my short term memory is supposed to be really really godo
1/10/16, 19:47 - Cindy L: and i drew them twice like two days before.
1/10/16, 19:48 - Mom: have u drawn those graphs on ur econ test?
1/10/16, 19:48 - Cindy L: ye
1/10/16, 19:49 - Cindy L: p

1/10/16, 19:49 - Cindy L: when u tax shit
1/10/16, 19:49 - Cindy L: no when u increase the price of stuff
1/10/16, 19:50 - Cindy L: i remembered the tax one
1/10/16, 19:50 - Cindy L: forgot the price increase and teh externalities one
1/10/16, 19:50 - Cindy L: usually i remember these like teh back of my hand if i drew them the day before
1/10/16, 19:50 - Cindy L: especially since they are graphs
1/10/16, 19:50 - Cindy L: because my visual memory is esp strong.
1/10/16, 19:51 - Cindy L: but no way to be sure
1/10/16, 19:51 - Cindy L: maybe econ is hard thats why.
1/10/16, 19:51 - Mom: i think the prob is ur actually not understanding well the topic
1/10/16, 19:52 - Mom: then something like uncertainty arises, ur mindset were mixed up
1/10/16, 19:53 - Mom: *... actually ur not ...
1/10/16, 19:53 - Cindy L: perhaps
1/10/16, 19:53 - Mom: *then when something ..
1/10/16, 19:54 - Cindy L: its like really simply stuff though
1/10/16, 19:54 - Mom: are there lots of incidents like this?

1/11/16, 09:45 - Cindy L: Lse seriously do not think people hv lunch
1/11/16, 09:46 - Cindy L: On the plus side they let u eat in lectures
1/11/16, 09:52 - Mom: perhaps they realize that u hv sleeping prob so just shift all ur classes to afternoon to help u
1/11/16, 09:52 - Cindy L: Lol
1/11/16, 09:52 - Cindy L: I doubt it
1/11/16, 09:53 - Cindy L: People only hv sleeping problem cuz they party too hard
1/11/16, 09:53 - Cindy L: Both my neighbours get up early in the morning and go to the gym and stuff
1/11/16, 09:54 - Cindy L: anyways I'm gonna try to improve my sleep hygiene
1/11/16, 09:54 - Cindy L: And sleep earlier
1/11/16, 09:54 - Mom: we also can eat/drink in lecturers b4 when i attended my uni
1/11/16, 09:54 - Cindy L: Cuz it seems to be the only thing which produced a drastic improvement
1/11/16, 09:55 - Cindy L: U can't do that in imperial according to my friend
1/11/16, 09:55 - Mom: üëèüëèüëèüëèüëè
1/11/16, 09:55 - Cindy L: It offends the prof
1/11/16, 09:55 - Cindy L: Apparently
1/11/16, 09:55 - Mom: no, he also brought soft drink into the class
1/11/16, 09:55 - Cindy L: Good
1/11/16, 09:56 - Cindy L: Imperial profs hv super large egos though
1/11/16, 09:58 - Mom: so they don't allow any drinks in lectures?
1/11/16, 09:59 - Cindy L: Water
1/11/16, 09:59 - Cindy L: Imperial's a bit weird
1/11/16, 10:00 - Cindy L: They sort of hv an inferiority complex
1/11/16, 10:00 - Cindy L: Of sorts
1/11/16, 10:00 - Mom: so what's the difference between water and can drink?
1/11/16, 10:00 - Cindy L: Saaaa
1/11/16, 10:00 - Cindy L: Water is a necessity
1/11/16, 10:00 - Mom: inferior or superior?
1/11/16, 10:00 - Cindy L: Inferior
1/11/16, 10:00 - Cindy L: Like they hv fragile self esteem
1/11/16, 10:01 - Mom: but if u bring in a water bottle, we don't know whether it's water of soft drink in it, right?
1/11/16, 10:01 - Cindy L: Probably cuz they used to be affiliated with uol
1/11/16, 10:01 - Cindy L: Okok
1/11/16, 10:01 - Cindy L: But u def can't eat
1/11/16, 10:01 - Mom: why inferior? bc of ranking lower than oxbridge?
1/11/16, 10:02 - Mom: fair enough, eating in class is sometimes troublesome
1/11/16, 10:02 - Cindy L: Dude I always bring snacks
1/11/16, 10:02 - Mom: then american uni is ur place
1/11/16, 10:02 - Cindy L: Inferior cuz they always need to reaffirm how good they are
1/11/16, 10:03 - Mom: come on, their worldwide ranking is so high
1/11/16, 10:03 - Cindy L: As opposed to lse doesn't give shits abt our ranking cuz we know that employers love us
1/11/16, 10:03 - Mom: that's true
1/11/16, 10:03 - Cindy L: I dunno, its just what my ic friend says
1/11/16, 10:04 - Cindy L: She also said that they teach u like idiots cuz that's what the profs think undergrads are
1/11/16, 10:04 - Cindy L: Hahahaha
1/11/16, 10:05 - Mom: like low iq students?
1/11/16, 10:05 - Cindy L: Like dumbasses who don't even know shit
1/11/16, 10:06 - Cindy L: I wish they taught like that at lse, .... Cuz I really don't know shit

1/11/16, 10:06 - Cindy L: Saaa she seems happy
1/11/16, 10:07 - Cindy L: I don't know whether she was joking or not
1/11/16, 10:07 - Mom: i think she has high standard on the uni
1/11/16, 10:07 - Mom: high expectations
1/11/16, 10:08 - Cindy L: Well u know we all complain abt ib but in the end we all like it
1/11/16, 10:08 - Mom: wtf

1/11/16, 10:10 - Mom: what's her major?
1/11/16, 10:10 - Cindy L: Undeclared
1/11/16, 10:10 - Mom: u can claim credit only on the basis that those subjects relate to ur major
1/11/16, 10:11 - Cindy L: Or relevant first yr courses
1/11/16, 10:11 - Cindy L: She said she was doing econ
1/11/16, 10:11 - Cindy L: But now I dunno if she changes her mind or not
1/11/16, 10:11 - Mom: so bio and chem not relate?
1/11/16, 10:13 - Cindy L: But u still needa take random  first yr courses
1/11/16, 10:13 - Cindy L: She still does chem btw
1/11/16, 10:16 - Mom: see ib is shit

1/11/16, 10:25 - Cindy L: Hahahaha
1/11/16, 10:26 - Mom: a bunch of failed ppl
1/11/16, 10:27 - Mom: do they hv inferior self-esteem?
1/11/16, 10:27 - Cindy L: Lol I think generally every single person in the country tries oxbridge
1/11/16, 10:28 - Mom: kind of lucky draw
1/11/16, 10:28 - Cindy L: Yea
1/11/16, 10:28 - Cindy L: Hahaha
1/11/16, 10:28 - Mom: hahaha

1/11/16, 10:29 - Mom: the lottery money has just gone, right?
1/11/16, 10:29 - Cindy L: Must be tough job to be admissions person at oxbridge
1/11/16, 10:29 - Mom: i don't think that
1/11/16, 10:29 - Mom: i think they like it
1/11/16, 10:29 - Cindy L: They hv to read through so many apps
1/11/16, 10:30 - Cindy L: I think that's why u need a tsa to get rid of some more efficiently
1/11/16, 10:30 - Cindy L: And Cambridge even interviews most of them.
1/11/16, 10:30 - Cindy L: Wow
1/11/16, 10:31 - Mom: so should apply to cambridge cuz u hv an interview and ur application fee justified
1/11/16, 10:31 - Cindy L: Yea I guess

1/11/16, 10:32 - Mom: exactly
1/11/16, 10:32 - Mom: u'll learn something in the application process even if they don't take u after the interview, right?
1/11/16, 10:32 - Cindy L: Not really.
1/11/16, 10:32 - Mom: that's value for money
1/11/16, 10:33 - Mom: why?
1/11/16, 10:33 - Cindy L: U learn stuff related to Oxbridge applications
1/11/16, 10:33 - Cindy L: That's like very niche stuff
1/11/16, 10:33 - Mom: no, i mean the interviewing experience
1/11/16, 10:34 - Cindy L: Erm their interview is different from employer interviews
1/11/16, 10:34 - Cindy L: Getting into jp Morgan is like a whole new story
1/11/16, 10:35 - Mom: i mean u'll hv the chance to talk to different levels of persons and see how they communicate and present their stuff
1/11/16, 10:35 - Cindy L: Sure

1/11/16, 10:38 - Mom: also in high holborn dorm?
1/11/16, 10:38 - Cindy L: I felt this thing like climb onto my bed and over my body
1/11/16, 10:38 - Cindy L: No not sure where it was
1/11/16, 10:39 - Cindy L: Some arbitrary bedroom in a house
1/11/16, 10:39 - Cindy L: Maybe tsing yi
1/11/16, 10:39 - Cindy L: So I literally felt this object climb over my body
1/11/16, 10:39 - Cindy L: It's wasn't human.
1/11/16, 10:40 - Mom: üò±üò±
1/11/16, 10:40 - Cindy L: Yea and I felt it

1/11/16, 10:41 - Mom: 3) u were awoken bc ur scare?
1/11/16, 10:41 - Mom: 4)  did that object do any harm to u?
1/11/16, 10:42 - Cindy L: Wait I shall draw it
1/11/16, 10:42 - Mom: ok
1/11/16, 10:45 - Cindy L: <Media omitted>
1/11/16, 10:45 - Cindy L: Imagine it could move and a bit flexible
1/11/16, 10:45 - Cindy L: So I felt that thing climb over my body
1/11/16, 10:46 - Cindy L: Yah it was scary but by that time I already knew I was dreaming
1/11/16, 10:46 - Mom: like a high chair?
1/11/16, 10:46 - Cindy L: Sort of but it was flat
1/11/16, 10:46 - Mom: then u just felt scary in ur dream
1/11/16, 10:46 - Cindy L: Yea but I knew I was dreamig
1/11/16, 10:46 - Mom: 2D?
1/11/16, 10:47 - Cindy L: No 3d
1/11/16, 10:47 - Cindy L: I said it can climb
1/11/16, 10:47 - Cindy L: Like how i drew it
1/11/16, 10:47 - Cindy L: Anyways
1/11/16, 10:47 - Mom: 3D, it has a thickness?
1/11/16, 10:47 - Cindy L: Lemme continue
1/11/16, 10:47 - Cindy L: So I knew I was dreaming
1/11/16, 10:48 - Cindy L: So I knew it wasn't real even though my brain could sense everything
1/11/16, 10:48 - Cindy L: Normally I would shake it off and try to move to wake myself up
1/11/16, 10:48 - Cindy L: From the nightmare
1/11/16, 10:48 - Cindy L: But I was really tired
1/11/16, 10:49 - Cindy L: So I kept still and waited for it to finish climbing into my bed
1/11/16, 10:49 - Cindy L: OK that's not the scary part
1/11/16, 10:49 - Cindy L: It didn't do anything
1/11/16, 10:50 - Cindy L: After it finished climbing over me I didn't feel its presence anymore
1/11/16, 10:50 - Cindy L: So after while it climb back over me and off the bed
1/11/16, 10:50 - Cindy L: I thought it was over
1/11/16, 10:50 - Cindy L: And then the thing brought back friends
1/11/16, 10:51 - Cindy L: At this point I can see them from the door
1/11/16, 10:51 - Mom: party?
1/11/16, 10:51 - Cindy L: Lol
1/11/16, 10:51 - Cindy L: I was like no way
1/11/16, 10:51 - Cindy L: And I woke up
1/11/16, 10:52 - Mom: Q: is that all in ur dream?
1/11/16, 10:52 - Mom: including ur feeing and sensation?
1/11/16, 10:52 - Cindy L: This is dream one
1/11/16, 10:53 - Cindy L: Yea including feeling and sensation
1/11/16, 10:53 - Cindy L: Quite vivid
1/11/16, 10:54 - Cindy L: The other dream was just I was in a car and we were like driving up this mountain
1/11/16, 10:54 - Mom: it like u were watching a video of urself
1/11/16, 10:54 - Cindy L: No its first person view
1/11/16, 10:55 - Cindy L: Like u are in that scenario
1/11/16, 10:55 - Cindy L: Imagine what u think virtual reality would be like
1/11/16, 10:55 - Cindy L: No smells or tastes
1/11/16, 10:55 - Mom: but u were seeing what happened in ur dream, right?
1/11/16, 10:55 - Cindy L: Yea
1/11/16, 10:56 - Cindy L: I was looking out of my eyes
1/11/16, 10:56 - Cindy L: I think in the beginning I didn't see anything cuz my eyes were closed
1/11/16, 10:56 - Cindy L: I was supposed to be sleeping
1/11/16, 10:57 - Mom: u hv ur eyes open later?
1/11/16, 10:57 - Cindy L: In the dream yea
1/11/16, 10:57 - Cindy L: Like when the thing climbed off
1/11/16, 10:57 - Mom: ic
1/11/16, 10:57 - Mom: so weird the dream
1/11/16, 10:57 - Cindy L: Yes
1/11/16, 10:57 - Mom: what abt second one?
1/11/16, 10:58 - Cindy L: It was just me in the back of a car and we drived up this mountain
1/11/16, 10:58 - Cindy L: And when we got up there there was this building
1/11/16, 10:58 - Cindy L: Which I instantly recognized as pmh
1/11/16, 10:58 - Cindy L: Hahaha
1/11/16, 10:58 - Cindy L: That's it
1/11/16, 10:58 - Mom: oh no
1/11/16, 10:58 - Cindy L: Don't remember what happened after
1/11/16, 10:59 - Cindy L: Not really a nightmare
1/11/16, 10:59 - Mom: ur so freak out
1/11/16, 10:59 - Mom: abt hospital
1/11/16, 10:59 - Cindy L: Anyways I also figured out what the hallucinations are
1/11/16, 11:00 - Cindy L: Cuz I also got them yesterday before I showered
1/11/16, 11:00 - Mom: u saw something
1/11/16, 11:00 - Cindy L: Wait
1/11/16, 11:01 - Cindy L: I was very sleepy in around 9:30
1/11/16, 11:01 - Cindy L: So I went to take a nap on my bed
1/11/16, 11:01 - Mom: 930 night time?
1/11/16, 11:01 - Cindy L: yes
1/11/16, 11:01 - Cindy L: didn't see anything then cuz my rem sleep tends to be blurred on waking as opposed to on falling alseep
1/11/16, 11:02 - Cindy L: so i didn't exactly fully wake up
1/11/16, 11:02 - Cindy L: there was a point where i must be bobbing between rem sleep and wakefulness
1/11/16, 11:02 - Cindy L: like going in and out between those two states
1/11/16, 11:03 - Cindy L: i saw u ironing clothes at the end of the bed
1/11/16, 11:03 - Cindy L: didn't realise that it didn't make sense at first
1/11/16, 11:03 - Cindy L: after i realised it didn't make any fucking sense
1/11/16, 11:04 - Cindy L: so i blinked and then i saw the clothes rack instead
1/11/16, 11:04 - Cindy L: but i wasn't exactly fully awake
1/11/16, 11:04 - Cindy L: so i went back to sleep
1/11/16, 11:04 - Cindy L: and then i started thinking about ghosts
1/11/16, 11:04 - Cindy L: bad news
1/11/16, 11:04 - Cindy L: cuz i looked at the wall
1/11/16, 11:04 - Cindy L: and then i saw this dark shadow
1/11/16, 11:04 - Cindy L: of a ghost.
1/11/16, 11:05 - Cindy L: which was carrying an axe above her head
1/11/16, 11:05 - Cindy L: and i could tell she was trying to chop my head off
1/11/16, 11:05 - Cindy L: i'm like oh shit
1/11/16, 11:05 - Cindy L: need to wake up
1/11/16, 11:05 - Cindy L: but its difficult cuz u still feel really tired
1/11/16, 11:05 - Cindy L: well in the end i woke up
1/11/16, 11:05 - Cindy L: and then i went to take a shower
1/11/16, 11:06 - Cindy L: so in those cases where i'm not sure whether i saw hallucinations or not
1/11/16, 11:06 - Cindy L: i think they're just me slipping between rem and wakefulness
1/11/16, 11:06 - Cindy L: rem makes me see crazy stuff
1/11/16, 11:07 - Cindy L: and during the brief periods where i'm awake, i think my eyes are actually open
1/11/16, 11:07 - Cindy L: so i see my surroundings
1/11/16, 11:07 - Cindy L: but then i slip back into rem sleep
1/11/16, 11:07 - Cindy L: and my brain constructs the dreamscape based on what i just saw
1/11/16, 11:08 - Cindy L: so that's why i still see my surroundings and i don't realise that i fall asleep
1/11/16, 11:08 - Cindy L: qed
1/11/16, 11:08 - Cindy L: if i try hard enough to move, i can fully wakeup
1/11/16, 11:09 - Cindy L: which is again a bit like when i try to move when i have cataplexy
1/11/16, 11:09 - Mom: 1) ru sure u rlly saw me in ur room with ur eyes opened?
1/11/16, 11:09 - Mom: 2)  also the figure from the wall?
1/11/16, 11:09 - Cindy L: noo  i didn't see u with my eyes open
1/11/16, 11:09 - Cindy L: i saw u in a dream
1/11/16, 11:10 - Cindy L: it was a shadow
1/11/16, 11:10 - Cindy L: so i knew the thing was behind me
1/11/16, 11:10 - Cindy L: i tend to see shadows and reflections rather than the thing itself
1/11/16, 11:10 - Mom: so both were from ur dream only?
1/11/16, 11:10 - Cindy L: dunno why
1/11/16, 11:10 - Cindy L: yea my point is when i see the crazy stuff, i'm dreaming
1/11/16, 11:10 - Cindy L: definitely in rem
1/11/16, 11:11 - Cindy L: but there are brief periods like maybe half a second or so
1/11/16, 11:11 - Cindy L: where my brain enters wakefulness
1/11/16, 11:11 - Cindy L: or is on the border
1/11/16, 11:11 - Cindy L: so i open my eyes for real then
1/11/16, 11:11 - Cindy L: and i actually see my surroundings
1/11/16, 11:12 - Mom: ur surroundings r normal?
1/11/16, 11:12 - Cindy L: the brain then uses these visual images to reconstruct the dreamscape
1/11/16, 11:12 - Cindy L: yea ofc teh surroundings are normal
1/11/16, 11:12 - Cindy L: cuz i'm looking at reality
1/11/16, 11:12 - Mom: what's u dinner last night?
1/11/16, 11:12 - Cindy L: so i don't realise when i fall back into rem
1/11/16, 11:13 - Cindy L: and that's why sometimes i think i'm hallucinating
1/11/16, 11:13 - Mom: ur
1/11/16, 11:13 - Cindy L: cuz i'm not sure whether i'm awake or not
1/11/16, 11:13 - Cindy L: ham
1/11/16, 11:13 - Cindy L: and cheese
1/11/16, 11:13 - Cindy L: and this mexican corn thing
1/11/16, 11:13 - Cindy L: it was the other half of my lunch
1/11/16, 11:14 - Mom: the roasted ham like the one at lunch?
1/11/16, 11:14 - Cindy L: yea
1/11/16, 11:14 - Cindy L: i thought maybe its something produced when proteins are metabolised
1/11/16, 11:14 - Cindy L: so i was looking into that
1/11/16, 11:14 - Cindy L: but protein is supposed to wake you up
1/11/16, 11:15 - Mom: u told that u felt drowsy after lunch and now u also felt sleepy after dinner
1/11/16, 11:15 - Cindy L: not make u sleepy
1/11/16, 11:15 - Cindy L: no actually that event happened almost 3hrs after dinner
1/11/16, 11:15 - Cindy L: i had dinner at 6
1/11/16, 11:15 - Cindy L: so i'm not even sure if its connected
1/11/16, 11:15 - Cindy L: or it might have been the honey glaze
1/11/16, 11:16 - Mom: 3hrs after meal - that means ur digestion almost completed and the nutrients start going into ur blood stream
1/11/16, 11:16 - Cindy L: yea but for lunch
1/11/16, 11:16 - Cindy L: i was drowsy within an hr
1/11/16, 11:17 - Cindy L: and i didn't get that weird feeling in my gut after dinner
1/11/16, 11:17 - Cindy L: which i did get after lunch
1/11/16, 11:18 - Mom: i was thinking whether there're any chemicals in the food when breaking down that cause ur   body's chemical imbalance and produce this kind of weird dream?
1/11/16, 11:18 - Cindy L: that's what i was trying to say yesterday
1/11/16, 11:19 - Mom: u hv exactly the same food for lunch and dinner?
1/11/16, 11:19 - Cindy L: yea
1/11/16, 11:19 - Cindy L: exactly the same
1/11/16, 11:19 - Cindy L: i had half in the morning and half in the evening
1/11/16, 11:19 - Mom: drinks?
1/11/16, 11:19 - Cindy L: i didn't have any coffee in the morning before lunch
1/11/16, 11:20 - Cindy L: only had it after lunch cuz i was feeling drowsy
1/11/16, 11:20 - Cindy L: and for dinner
1/11/16, 11:20 - Cindy L: i had like half a cup of hot chocolate.
1/11/16, 11:21 - Cindy L: well i didn't sleep so good yesterday, i'm probably gonna go into a brief seizure during lecture
1/11/16, 11:21 - Mom: u can repeat the test with exactly same setting to see if there is anything wrong with the food?
1/11/16, 11:21 - Mom: yesterday, u didn't hv lecture
1/11/16, 11:21 - Cindy L: yesterday was sunday -.-
1/11/16, 11:22 - Cindy L: i did go to the cinema the previous two days
1/11/16, 11:22 - Cindy L: and i always fell asleep briefly within 1 hr of the film
1/11/16, 11:22 - Mom: but u mention abt seizure during lecture? when?
1/11/16, 11:22 - Cindy L: like
1/11/16, 11:23 - Cindy L: its an extended period of muscle atonia basically
1/11/16, 11:23 - Cindy L: can't move
1/11/16, 11:23 - Cindy L: but can hear and still conscious
1/11/16, 11:23 - Cindy L: but after a while
1/11/16, 11:23 - Cindy L: not sure how long
1/11/16, 11:23 - Cindy L: consciousness alters as well
1/11/16, 11:23 - Cindy L: and i go to sleep
1/11/16, 11:24 - Cindy L: and then later i wake up by myself
1/11/16, 11:24 - Cindy L: automatically
1/11/16, 11:24 - Cindy L: by extended period i'm talking around 10 to 15 mins
1/11/16, 11:25 - Cindy L: that used to happen when i looked at computer screen for too long as well
1/11/16, 11:25 - Cindy L: now not so much
1/11/16, 11:26 - Cindy L: this is different from the rem hallucinations i was talking about previously
1/11/16, 11:30 - Cindy L: i also forgot to mention that all this shit tends to happen when i'm alone
1/11/16, 11:30 - Cindy L: which must mean god is fucking with me
1/11/16, 11:33 - Mom: i also notice that all these experience happened when ur in uk, right? in hk, u seldom hv so much weird thing
1/11/16, 11:34 - Mom: u know, i was once thinking there had been something happened at ur dorm b4
1/11/16, 11:34 - Mom: then i google the high holborn residence, but found nothing
1/11/16, 11:50 - Cindy L: mopps
1/11/16, 11:50 - Cindy L: even if u find something
1/11/16, 11:50 - Cindy L: don't tell me
1/11/16, 11:50 - Cindy L: don't u dare
1/11/16, 11:50 - Cindy L: or else i think my mind will break
1/11/16, 11:50 - Mom: but i can't find anything honestly
1/11/16, 11:51 - Mom: clean records
1/11/16, 11:51 - Cindy L: good to know
1/11/16, 11:52 - Mom: then the next thing is to investigate why ur dream is so weird in london
1/11/16, 11:54 - Mom: is it possible u feel rlly lonely that makes u generate this kind of weird thoughts and then like u said u have the dreamscape, then u just create other storyline?
1/11/16, 11:54 - Mom: i'm not saying ur making up things, but that might be ur creativity giving rise these kind of weird stuff?
1/11/16, 11:55 - Mom: just wild guess
1/11/16, 11:55 - Mom: but one thing i'm sure is that all such things happened only in ur dreams, and u don't hv any hallucinations
1/11/16, 11:56 - Mom: no class this afternoon?
1/11/16, 14:54 - Mom: * serotonin levels are lower in sleep than while awake
1/11/16, 14:56 - Mom: * they are at their lowest during REM sleep, also act as "REM inhibitor"
1/11/16, 15:08 - Cindy L: I know serotonin is low
1/11/16, 15:08 - Cindy L: Its completely depleted serotonin, adrenalin and histamine
1/11/16, 15:09 - Cindy L: With dominant levels of acetycholine
1/11/16, 15:11 - Cindy L: So I was just reading some stuff abt sleep paralysis again
1/11/16, 15:12 - Cindy L: Yea apparently u get hypnagogic sensations as well with it
1/11/16, 15:13 - Cindy L: And they seem similar to the stuff I'm describing
1/11/16, 15:13 - Mom: ur too sensitive, ur trying to fit urself into the illness and get diagnosis
1/11/16, 15:14 - Mom: i just realised ur nightmares were actually not nightmares
1/11/16, 15:14 - Cindy L: ... I just suggest it's similar to sleep paralysis
1/11/16, 15:15 - Cindy L: Even if I have narco
1/11/16, 15:15 - Cindy L: It's like narco version 2.0
1/11/16, 15:15 - Mom: 1)  u saw me ironing at the end of ur bed - this is just from ur memory cuz u used to see me ironing at young age
1/11/16, 15:15 - Cindy L: No I literally saw u there. At the end
1/11/16, 15:15 - Mom: 2) ur memory of pmh, this is simple and easy to explain
1/11/16, 15:16 - Cindy L: Pmh is a dream
1/11/16, 15:16 - Cindy L: That's separate
1/11/16, 15:16 - Mom: if u see me, why don't u talk to me?
1/11/16, 15:16 - Cindy L: I dunno I never talk to the visions.
1/11/16, 15:16 - Mom: i'm not that scare, right?
1/11/16, 15:16 - Mom: but u just saw me ironing, right?
1/11/16, 15:17 - Cindy L: And I can't move
1/11/16, 15:17 - Cindy L: Forgot to say that
1/11/16, 15:17 - Mom: did i look at u and talk to u or whatever?
1/11/16, 15:18 - Cindy L: No, ur just ironing
1/11/16, 15:18 - Cindy L: It was very brief moment
1/11/16, 15:19 - Mom: no. 1, i'm still alive here, that won't be my spirit
1/11/16, 15:19 - Cindy L: üòë
1/11/16, 15:19 - Cindy L: üòëüòëüòëüòëüòëüòëüòëüòëüòëüòë
1/11/16, 15:20 - Mom: no.2 u don't even remember surely that ur eyes were open at that particular point of time, how could u be so certain that's not an image from ur dream/memory?
1/11/16, 15:21 - Mom: what i'm trying to say is that don't try to think of something particularly weird stuff to scare urself and make urself unnecessary nervous, right?
1/11/16, 15:23 - Cindy L: U know during sleep paralysis
1/11/16, 15:23 - Mom: 3)  as for that non-human stuff in ur dream, think abt the supporter i recently bought u, the shape looks very much alike with the picture u drew
1/11/16, 15:23 - Cindy L: Eyes r closed
1/11/16, 15:23 - Cindy L: What supporter?
1/11/16, 15:23 - Mom: so, i'm quite certain that all these r from ur dream and creativity
1/11/16, 15:23 - Cindy L: The neck supporter? I hvent even received ot
1/11/16, 15:23 - Mom: ur so creative
1/11/16, 15:23 - Cindy L: .....
1/11/16, 15:24 - Cindy L: Yo don't u see how we need to understand rem to fix cataplexy?
1/11/16, 15:25 - Mom: i know ur trying to explain ur cataplexy
1/11/16, 15:29 - Cindy L: I'm trying to understand how the neuromuscular system is connected to the limbix system
1/11/16, 15:29 - Cindy L: And then I'm trying to fucking debug this program.
1/11/16, 15:30 - Cindy L: Honestly I think adrenaline is probably the one which fucked up
1/11/16, 15:30 - Cindy L: Cuz
1/11/16, 15:30 - Cindy L: Adrenaline is a muscle relaxant
1/11/16, 15:30 - Cindy L: At the same time it also regulates mood
1/11/16, 15:31 - Cindy L: So we must look into the amygdala
1/11/16, 15:31 - Cindy L: Cuz some how all of this is related to the fight or flight system.
1/11/16, 15:33 - Mom: i'm trying to fix my wifi cuz they're not working tonight, always no wifi
1/11/16, 15:36 - Mom: https://thumbnail.image.rakuten.co.jp/@0_gold/nakayama-shiki/images/item/supporter/3720/3720_item_001.jpg?_ex=168x168

1/11/16, 15:42 - Cindy L: It was big and thick
1/11/16, 15:44 - Mom: with ur imaginations and creativity, thing might be altered
1/11/16, 15:45 - Mom: that damp wifi connection makes me so tired
1/11/16, 15:49 - Mom: sorry, got to shower first

1/12/16, 15:26 - Cindy L: And he was serving me food
1/12/16, 15:27 - Cindy L: And then I forgot what he talked abt
1/12/16, 15:27 - Cindy L: And then the subject was abt this other person who is dead
1/12/16, 15:27 - Cindy L: At some point
1/12/16, 15:28 - Cindy L: I realised that the person I was talking was the dead person .
1/12/16, 15:28 - Cindy L: Which was fucking creepy as hell
1/12/16, 15:28 - Cindy L: And I also had a feeling I wasn't eating food
1/12/16, 15:28 - Cindy L: And then I woke up

1/13/16, 08:39 - Cindy L: Make y hv heat flushes
1/13/16, 08:40 - Mom: i think that's ur thyroid causing it
1/13/16, 08:40 - Cindy L: No
1/13/16, 08:40 - Cindy L: I'm not getting hot flushes
1/13/16, 08:40 - Cindy L: It heart rate is supposed to rise
1/13/16, 08:40 - Cindy L: Hence not estradiol levels
1/13/16, 08:41 - Cindy L: Probably
1/13/16, 08:41 - Cindy L: Irregular heat regulation cuz orexin
1/13/16, 08:42 - Mom: orexin doesn't make u heat
1/13/16, 08:42 - Cindy L: Though my skin temp is normal not sleeping.
1/13/16, 08:42 - Cindy L: Low orexin does
1/13/16, 08:43 - Mom: if ur going to ovulate, then ur body temp will rise in the morning
1/13/16, 08:43 - Cindy L: That's ttue
1/13/16, 08:43 - Cindy L: True
1/13/16, 08:43 - Cindy L: But doesn't explain why it happens every single night.
1/13/16, 08:44 - Mom: and if that's low orexin level u shudn't be awaken but instead asleep
1/13/16, 08:44 - Mom: but do u rlly wake up at 4 bc of ur body temp rise every night?
1/13/16, 08:44 - Mom: every morning?

1/13/16, 12:37 - Mom: that's a new model at that time
1/13/16, 12:37 - Cindy L: ok factor in depreciation

1/13/16, 14:23 - Mom: then?

1/13/16, 14:25 - Mom: and u just fell on the floor having looked at the post?
1/13/16, 14:26 - Cindy L: No I was gonna type a reply
1/13/16, 14:26 - Cindy L: And then I laughed at that too
1/13/16, 14:27 - Cindy L: Plus not to mention u was standing cuz standing desk
1/13/16, 14:27 - Cindy L: And then she called me and basically repeated he message
1/13/16, 14:27 - Cindy L: So the same joke was repeated abt 5 times
1/13/16, 14:28 - Cindy L: While led me to completely collapse on the floor for quite a while
1/13/16, 14:28 - Cindy L: I couldn't even turn on the speakerphone
1/13/16, 14:28 - Mom: fell on the floor from a standing point right?
1/13/16, 14:29 - Cindy L: Pretty much
1/13/16, 14:29 - Mom: did u hurt ur body/head?
1/13/16, 14:30 - Cindy L: No
1/13/16, 14:30 - Cindy L: I am a master fallrr
1/13/16, 14:30 - Cindy L: Faller
1/13/16, 14:30 - Cindy L: Except I don't know how to break fall
1/13/16, 14:30 - Mom: how long u recover from that position? half an hour?
1/13/16, 14:30 - Cindy L: Maybe I should learn that
1/13/16, 14:30 - Cindy L: Yea literally
1/13/16, 14:30 - Cindy L: It was like
1/13/16, 14:31 - Cindy L: There were brief moments when I regain muscle tone
1/13/16, 14:31 - Cindy L: To pick myself up
1/13/16, 14:31 - Cindy L: And then I just collapse back again
1/13/16, 14:31 - Cindy L: And also
1/13/16, 14:31 - Cindy L: I had hypnagogic sensations
1/13/16, 14:32 - Cindy L: Like I thought I was playing some horror game on my phone
1/13/16, 14:32 - Cindy L: I could here sounds from it
1/13/16, 14:32 - Mom: ru conscious for those half hour duration?
1/13/16, 14:32 - Cindy L: But the screen was dark which I though was because the screen bright was was down
1/13/16, 14:32 - Cindy L: Yea full consciousness
1/13/16, 14:33 - Cindy L: Cuz I had to answer my friend on the phone
1/13/16, 14:33 - Cindy L: And then so I kept trying to quit the game on my phone
1/13/16, 14:33 - Cindy L: Outside my door I also heard a crowd of people out there talking
1/13/16, 14:34 - Cindy L: But I knew that there was nobody outside cuz I had my door propped open
1/13/16, 14:34 - Mom: u can't move during that 30mins, how could u continue talk to ur friend?
1/13/16, 14:34 - Cindy L: Yea I couldnt
1/13/16, 14:34 - Cindy L: But before I loss complete tone
1/13/16, 14:34 - Cindy L: I answered the phone
1/13/16, 14:34 - Cindy L: So she was on the line
1/13/16, 14:35 - Cindy L: and I couldn't reply
1/13/16, 14:35 - Cindy L: If I put in a massive amount of efort
1/13/16, 14:35 - Cindy L: I could press on or two buttons
1/13/16, 14:35 - Cindy L: So I clicked Google voice to input text
1/13/16, 14:36 - Mom: wait a minute
1/13/16, 14:36 - Mom: let me clarify ur position here
1/13/16, 14:36 - Mom: 1)  u fell on the floor bc of an episode
1/13/16, 14:37 - Mom: 2)  u lose ur muscle tone and even can't speak to ur friend on the phone
1/13/16, 14:37 - Cindy L: OK I think I was paralysed for abt 10 -15 mins
1/13/16, 14:37 - Mom: 3)  but u start to have sensations hearing sounds from the phone and from outside ur room right
1/13/16, 14:38 - Cindy L: Cuz I just checked WhatsApp history
1/13/16, 14:38 - Cindy L: Yep
1/13/16, 14:38 - Mom: 4) as u said the whole process last for abt 10-15 mins
1/13/16, 14:39 - Cindy L: Yep
1/13/16, 14:39 - Cindy L: Makes sense
1/13/16, 14:39 - Cindy L: Long cataplexy episodes always induce hypnagogic sensations
1/13/16, 14:39 - Mom: q: ur actually not talking to ur friend during these 15 mins right
1/13/16, 14:39 - Cindy L: I couldn't
1/13/16, 14:40 - Mom: i was just confirming my understanding
1/13/16, 14:40 - Cindy L: But she was connected for quite a whike
1/13/16, 14:40 - Cindy L: And then I hung up
1/13/16, 14:40 - Cindy L: And after that was when I got the hypnagogic shit
1/13/16, 14:41 - Mom: hmm
1/13/16, 14:42 - Mom: 10-15mins is a rather long period
1/13/16, 14:42 - Cindy L: Yep
1/13/16, 14:42 - Mom: in my memory, u seldom have such long episode
1/13/16, 14:42 - Cindy L: Short cataplexy eps last less than 1 min
1/13/16, 14:43 - Cindy L: Most of the time is just brief weakness and irregular breathing
1/13/16, 14:43 - Mom: yea, those r the usaual eps
1/13/16, 14:43 - Mom: how often do u have so long eps in ur memory?
1/13/16, 14:44 - Cindy L: When I watch YouTube videos
1/13/16, 14:44 - Cindy L: Sometimes
1/13/16, 14:44 - Cindy L: Rare
1/13/16, 14:44 - Cindy L: Dude actually i haven't even laughed so hard for a long time
1/13/16, 14:44 - Mom: u think its the accumulative effect?
1/13/16, 14:45 - Cindy L: But I get hypnagogic sensations quite often
1/13/16, 14:45 - Cindy L: Not really
1/13/16, 14:45 - Cindy L: Lvl of cataplexy hasn't really chanhed
1/13/16, 14:45 - Cindy L: Just as bad a before
1/13/16, 14:45 - Cindy L: I just avoid funny stuff
1/13/16, 14:46 - Mom: but level of sleepiness remains unchanged?
1/13/16, 14:47 - Cindy L: eds improved
1/13/16, 14:47 - Cindy L: I think
1/13/16, 14:47 - Cindy L: Or maybe I just found more distractions
1/13/16, 14:47 - Cindy L: And not to mention more people here
1/13/16, 14:47 - Cindy L: To interact with
1/13/16, 14:47 - Cindy L: I suppose
1/13/16, 14:48 - Cindy L: No but eds did improve
1/13/16, 14:48 - Mom: u mean doing more things keep u awake?
1/13/16, 14:48 - Cindy L: Kind of
1/13/16, 14:48 - Cindy L: No I take it back
1/13/16, 14:48 - Cindy L: I think it's improved
1/13/16, 14:48 - Mom: ok
1/13/16, 14:49 - Mom: but ur cataplexy won't last for such a long duration b4?
1/13/16, 14:49 - Cindy L: No I always had long periods
1/13/16, 14:50 - Mom: and i wonder u just go into rem sleep immediate after the cataplexy eps
1/13/16, 14:50 - Cindy L: If the funny stimulus is repeatedly applied
1/13/16, 14:50 - Cindy L: Then I will basically go into a long episode
1/13/16, 14:50 - Cindy L: It's not sleeping
1/13/16, 14:50 - Cindy L: Cuz I was fully conscious
1/13/16, 14:50 - Mom: but u had weird sensation right
1/13/16, 14:51 - Cindy L: Yes
1/13/16, 14:51 - Cindy L: I heard stufd
1/13/16, 14:51 - Cindy L: They r clearly hypnagogic sensations/ hallucinations
1/13/16, 14:51 - Cindy L: Whatever name u like to call them
1/13/16, 14:52 - Mom: therefore u have already gone to another environment
1/13/16, 14:52 - Mom: how could u say ur conscious?
1/13/16, 14:54 - Mom: if ur rlly conscious, u shud have receive clear information from surrounding, not distorted sensations which blurr ur correct judgement
1/13/16, 14:54 - Cindy L: .....
1/13/16, 14:55 - Cindy L: Fuck u mopps I know what conscious is.
1/13/16, 14:55 - Mom: why so angry?
1/13/16, 14:56 - Mom: i just want to point out that ur brain might have already gone into another state from wakefulness to rem/sleep state
1/13/16, 14:57 - Cindy L: That's why I'm telling u they r hallucinations
1/13/16, 14:57 - Cindy L: Those r stuff that are supposed to stay in the rem world leaking into my wakeful reality
1/13/16, 14:58 - Cindy L: Not to mention the sad news is the nobody knows how rem atonia works
1/13/16, 14:58 - Cindy L: Or why we even dream.
1/13/16, 15:08 - Cindy L: The only Good thing is that they finally started looking into t cells
1/13/16, 15:09 - Cindy L: Which still means that fossil fuels will run out faster than I can hope of any cure.
1/13/16, 15:11 - Mom: i dare not to reply la cuz i don't want to get fucked
1/13/16, 15:12 - Cindy L: Ha hahaha
1/13/16, 15:13 - Cindy L: That actually made me laugh
1/13/16, 15:13 - Cindy L: I might as well spend the rest of the day making lemoande

1/13/16, 15:27 - Mom: ru stil taking vitamin D?
1/13/16, 15:36 - Mom: Around 3 or 4am is when adrenaline peaks typically, so if your stress hormone baseline is high, that surge can wake you up. Matt sees that a lot. From 12 Paleo Myths, in the list of common paleo fail symptoms:
‚ÄúWaking at 4am \nOur natural rhythms seem to set 4am as the time to awaken with a surge of adrenaline when things start to become ‚Äúoff.‚Äù I do believe that this can have something to do with running out of sugar and salt at the cellular level ‚Äì once again relating to overall metabolism. \nUsually there is a strong urge to urinate and feelings of extreme hunger or thirst, rapid pulse, and anxiety. Putting sugar and salt under the tongue at this time is very helpful for taming this adrenaline surge. This is another thing to watch out for and take action to correct.‚Äù \nYou can also try a salty carby snack, like two or three crackers or pretzels, to help deal with that, and get you back to a less stress-hormone dominant state, and more quickly back to sleep.

1/15/16, 16:33 - Mom: that's why lse has so little meeting time cuz students hv to do many reading by themselves
1/15/16, 16:33 - Cindy L: in a different country where u have to collect ur own data for

1/15/16, 16:34 - Mom: don't know, just guess
1/15/16, 16:34 - Cindy L: it's literally collect ur own data
1/15/16, 16:35 - Cindy L: for the exam you just read and interpret regression tables in way too many words than necessary
1/15/16, 16:35 - Mom: ok
1/15/16, 16:35 - Cindy L: u know how the girl next me speaks?
1/15/16, 16:36 - Cindy L: ok
1/15/16, 16:36 - Cindy L: it's like
1/15/16, 16:37 - Cindy L: politicians get the incentive to conduct monetary transactions to buy off political activity from people belonging to the less financially capable classes
1/15/16, 16:37 - Cindy L: normal talk:
1/15/16, 16:37 - Cindy L: poilticians bribe poor people to vote for them.
1/15/16, 16:37 - Cindy L: *face palm
1/15/16, 16:38 - Mom: then she doesn't like u right?
1/15/16, 16:39 - Cindy L: well i dunno about that
1/15/16, 16:39 - Cindy L: but
1/15/16, 16:39 - Cindy L: its like slow death
1/15/16, 16:39 - Mom: u mean after the conversation?
1/15/16, 16:40 - Cindy L: the whole damn thing
1/15/16, 16:40 - Cindy L: i only hang out with people from math u know
1/15/16, 16:40 - Cindy L: its that sad
1/15/16, 16:41 - Mom: cuz the maths ppl can't count on politics students
1/15/16, 16:41 - Cindy L: no cuz they speak normally
1/15/16, 16:41 - Mom: so funny
1/15/16, 16:42 - Cindy L: or business and managment
1/15/16, 16:42 - Cindy L: those people are more normal
1/15/16, 16:42 - Mom: do u mean the russian girl?
1/15/16, 16:42 - Mom: isn't she a general studies student?
1/15/16, 16:42 - Cindy L: she's econ major
1/15/16, 16:42 - Cindy L: nah i don't really hang out with the russian girl
1/15/16, 16:42 - Cindy L: that much
1/15/16, 16:43 - Cindy L: she's just my neighbour
1/15/16, 16:43 - Cindy L: i mean
1/15/16, 16:43 - Cindy L: what can we do
1/15/16, 16:43 - Cindy L: she like classical music

1/15/16, 16:43 - Cindy L: and is all fruit and yogurt
1/15/16, 16:43 - Mom: i mean the one u mentioned speaking so abnormally abt politicians
1/15/16, 16:44 - Cindy L: dude
1/15/16, 16:44 - Cindy L: it's not just that girl
1/15/16, 16:44 - Cindy L: majority of government students are like that
1/15/16, 16:44 - Cindy L: its like they cannot communicate ideas in a non verbose manner
1/15/16, 16:45 - Mom: but isn't it normal for a politician and a pre-politician?
1/15/16, 16:46 - Cindy L: u realise the students from lse do not become politicians?
1/15/16, 16:46 - Mom: hmm
1/15/16, 16:46 - Cindy L: its like that tv show
1/15/16, 16:46 - Cindy L: the thick of it
1/15/16, 16:46 - Cindy L: so true
1/15/16, 16:46 - Cindy L: everything is bullshit
1/15/16, 16:46 - Cindy L: real bullshit
1/15/16, 16:47 - Mom: so why study politics and go to lse to study politics?
1/15/16, 16:48 - Cindy L: i remember now
1/15/16, 16:48 - Cindy L: i thought i was gonna learn about globalization
1/15/16, 16:48 - Cindy L: turns out not
1/15/16, 16:49 - Mom: u thought the course learn abt globalization?
1/15/16, 16:49 - Mom: and turns out not?
1/15/16, 16:49 - Cindy L: brb
1/15/16, 16:50 - Mom: so ru saying that u mis-interpret the course?
1/15/16, 16:56 - Cindy L: yea ofc
1/15/16, 16:56 - Cindy L: we already figured this out ages ago
1/15/16, 16:56 - Cindy L: it's not rocket science
1/15/16, 16:56 - Cindy L: though i think rocket science is making more progress than brain science
1/15/16, 16:56 - Cindy L: phhuhuuh
1/15/16, 16:57 - Mom: then i think u shud choose ir and econ
1/15/16, 16:58 - Cindy L: no if i'm choosing anything i'm gonna do math and econ instead
1/15/16, 17:00 - Mom: but what're u plan now? just waiting for imperial? transfer to maths and econ at lse? or apply for transfer to a us uni? u have to think it now?
1/15/16, 17:01 - Cindy L: 1. imperial
1/15/16, 17:01 - Cindy L: 2. cmu transfer if possible cuz they have a brain hub there
1/15/16, 17:01 - Cindy L: lol going back to cmu again
1/15/16, 17:02 - Cindy L: 3. switch to math and econ
1/15/16, 17:02 - Cindy L: i can still be a dev if i do math and econ
1/15/16, 17:02 - Cindy L: anyways i think first year is just ma100
1/15/16, 17:02 - Cindy L: and they have electives
1/15/16, 17:02 - Cindy L: and i did the econ bit
1/15/16, 17:02 - Cindy L: so its just one paper
1/15/16, 17:03 - Mom: but my point is u have to start doing all the preparation works like applications....etc
1/15/16, 17:03 - Mom: not just waiting until march
1/15/16, 17:03 - Cindy L: i need to just ask about the transfer
1/15/16, 17:04 - Cindy L: u see i am waiting for imperial
1/15/16, 17:04 - Mom: i know it ofc
1/15/16, 17:04 - Cindy L: to see if they are gonna seriously consider my app or not
1/15/16, 17:04 - Cindy L: i can't believe they don't even send an acknowledgement email
1/15/16, 17:05 - Mom: but the point is u never know until may be so late in mar/may
1/15/16, 17:05 - Cindy L: i mean really all i need to know is 1/ did they receive my app? 2/ did they throw my app in the bin? 3/ are the gonna interview me
1/15/16, 17:06 - Mom: i just read from the studentroom, ppl applying last yr said they were rejected after 5 months of waiting without any communication from imperial
1/15/16, 17:06 - Cindy L: ....
1/15/16, 17:06 - Cindy L: what the hell
1/15/16, 17:06 - Cindy L: not even a thank you for your application?
1/15/16, 17:07 - Mom: ofc not
1/15/16, 17:07 - Cindy L: jesus christ
1/15/16, 17:07 - Cindy L: u know what i'll see how different math and econ is first
1/15/16, 17:07 - Cindy L: i know a guy from that dept
1/15/16, 17:08 - Mom: ppl got offer even didn't receive communications from imperial, they just knew it from ucas
1/15/16, 17:08 - Cindy L: right
1/15/16, 17:08 - Cindy L: so i assume they just use the ucas system
1/15/16, 17:08 - Cindy L: fine fair enough
1/15/16, 17:08 - Cindy L: i'll assume they received it
1/15/16, 17:09 - Cindy L: i think they just email u if they wanna interview you
1/15/16, 17:09 - Cindy L: well now we wai
1/15/16, 17:09 - Cindy L: tt
1/15/16, 17:09 - Mom: so i suggest besides of waiting, u shud start prepare for other alternatives in the same time
1/15/16, 17:09 - Cindy L: ucas apps just closed today
1/15/16, 17:10 - Cindy L: ok i'll email carnegie mellon next week
1/15/16, 17:10 - Mom: but it seems that they're giving out offer already
1/15/16, 17:10 - Mom: i just read one from studentroom.uk
1/15/16, 17:10 - Cindy L: maybe that student was exceptional
1/15/16, 17:11 - Cindy L: is this specifically for deng?
1/15/16, 17:12 - Mom: don't know, but from what i read from the forum what imperial wants are those having geniune knowledge and motivation abt the course they offer
1/15/16, 17:12 - Cindy L: okay so not design eng
1/15/16, 17:12 - Cindy L: irrelevant then
1/15/16, 17:12 - Mom: they want a solid applicant
1/15/16, 17:12 - Cindy L: dude higher math and physics and i already meet their offer and i write a pretty damn good ps if i must say
1/15/16, 17:13 - Cindy L: isn't that like the definition of solid?
1/15/16, 17:13 - Cindy L: plus i'm female
1/15/16, 17:13 - Mom: hope they pick u
1/15/16, 17:13 - Cindy L: or i'll see if carnegie mellon will
1/15/16, 17:16 - Cindy L: kind of a pity to have to leave london though
1/15/16, 17:17 - Cindy L: i forgot to mention one of my modules this yr is basically a pass/fail
1/15/16, 17:17 - Cindy L: hahaha
1/15/16, 17:20 - Mom: no grade?
1/15/16, 17:20 - Cindy L: it doesn't count
1/15/16, 17:20 - Cindy L: basically what  they do it
1/15/16, 17:20 - Cindy L: take your 'papers'
1/15/16, 17:20 - Cindy L: and average out the performance
1/15/16, 17:20 - Mom: but i remember u said first yr count 1/9 of the total grade right?
1/15/16, 17:20 - Cindy L: no
1/15/16, 17:20 - Cindy L: 11%
1/15/16, 17:21 - Cindy L: and that's not how it works
1/15/16, 17:21 - Mom: 1/9 = 11%
1/15/16, 17:21 - Cindy L: apparently for a 1st
1/15/16, 17:21 - Cindy L: all u need is 5 papers with a first
1/15/16, 17:21 - Cindy L: that's less than half of them
1/15/16, 17:21 - Mom: 5 papers from 3 years?
1/15/16, 17:21 - Cindy L: yep
1/15/16, 17:22 - Mom: wow it sounds like easy
1/15/16, 17:22 - Cindy L: the guy from third year said so
1/15/16, 17:22 - Mom: but is it hard to get a first
1/15/16, 17:22 - Mom: in a paper
1/15/16, 17:22 - Cindy L: not sure
1/15/16, 17:22 - Cindy L: people say
1/15/16, 17:23 - Cindy L: there are some people who get lie 90% or even close to full on paper
1/15/16, 17:23 - Cindy L: this is every year
1/15/16, 17:23 - Cindy L: so i suppose it's not that hard?
1/15/16, 17:23 - Cindy L: well the one paper i did was not that hard
1/15/16, 17:24 - Cindy L: and they gave u adequate time to answer the questions
1/15/16, 17:24 - Mom: but 1st year papers don't count right?
1/15/16, 17:24 - Cindy L: so time mgmt is not that hard
1/15/16, 17:24 - Cindy L: 3 of them do
1/15/16, 17:25 - Cindy L: i know what u're thinking right now
1/15/16, 17:25 - Mom: okay then best of luck
1/15/16, 17:25 - Cindy L: if it's that easy to get a first, why don't more people get a first?
1/15/16, 17:25 - Mom: ??
1/15/16, 17:25 - Mom: no i don't think that
1/15/16, 17:25 - Cindy L: that's cuz white people are dumb
1/15/16, 17:25 - Cindy L: they take interesting courses
1/15/16, 17:26 - Mom: lol

1/15/16, 19:02 - Mom: hv read the name transferwise but never study what it is
1/15/16, 19:02 - Cindy L: oh well just in case
1/15/16, 19:03 - Cindy L: cuz i've heard that they are gonna raise interest rates
1/15/16, 19:03 - Cindy L: transferwise is like a way to buy currency without doing so from the bank
1/15/16, 19:03 - Cindy L: not sure how they do it

1/16/16, 08:31 - Cindy L: U rmb long a go u asked me what impression western ppl here had of the lse?
1/16/16, 08:33 - Cindy L: So  apparently in Europe, lse is known as the top IR school, not econ.
1/16/16, 08:33 - Cindy L: Essentially, they created it IR as a discipline
1/16/16, 08:34 - Cindy L: So I was like
1/16/16, 08:34 - Cindy L: Wh√†aa... This makes so much sense now

1/16/16, 10:01 - Cindy L: It was so funny
1/16/16, 10:02 - Cindy L: Half of it was just the guy yelling at the lady for using the term 'recessional growth'
1/16/16, 10:02 - Cindy L: Which just means less growth
1/16/16, 10:02 - Cindy L: So I agree with that dude.

1/17/16, 16:01 - Cindy L: Which is actually quite good
1/17/16, 16:01 - Cindy L: I just hate government
1/17/16, 16:02 - Cindy L: With a burning passion
1/17/16, 16:02 - Mom: but it seems ur so chaotic now
1/17/16, 16:02 - Cindy L: What do you mean?

1/17/16, 16:04 - Cindy L: And irrelevant
1/17/16, 16:05 - Cindy L: Not planning to change the world either so understanding voter behaviour aint gonna do much for me
1/17/16, 16:05 - Cindy L: According to my friend
1/17/16, 16:06 - Cindy L: Lots of ic people go into finance cuz engineering aren't high enough pay
1/17/16, 16:06 - Cindy L: But they're like super serious over there

1/17/16, 16:08 - Cindy L: Oh turns outy friend hates cad, sketching and using the machines.
1/17/16, 16:09 - Cindy L: *Turns out my friend
1/17/16, 16:09 - Cindy L: So I guess u were right she doesn't like eng cuz shes not suited for it maybe
1/17/16, 16:09 - Mom: see i guess right
1/17/16, 16:10 - Mom: ur friend picks the wrong choice as well
1/17/16, 16:10 - Mom: so ru going to apply for the scholarship?
1/17/16, 16:10 - Cindy L: Yea but she really didn't hv much of a choice
1/17/16, 16:10 - Cindy L: Cuz parenta
1/17/16, 16:10 - Cindy L: Yea why not
1/17/16, 16:10 - Cindy L: 27k is a lot to pay

1/17/16, 16:11 - Cindy L: No just asians
1/17/16, 16:11 - Cindy L: We were discussing school fees the other day with the Brit guy next door
1/17/16, 16:11 - Cindy L: And googling up gdps
1/17/16, 16:11 - Cindy L: Only in lse.
1/17/16, 16:11 - Cindy L: Hahaha
1/17/16, 16:12 - Mom: what's gdps?
1/17/16, 16:12 - Cindy L: GDP
1/17/16, 16:15 - Cindy L: Apparently gen course kids get 10%off master here
1/17/16, 16:15 - Cindy L: And then the Americans came enthusiastically
1/17/16, 16:15 - Cindy L: Cuz cheap cheap
1/17/16, 16:33 - Mom: yea compare to american fee, it's so cheap to study in lse
1/17/16, 16:34 - Mom: this also explains why lse is so international
1/17/16, 16:53 - Cindy L: Hahaha
1/17/16, 16:53 - Cindy L: It's not really that international
1/17/16, 16:53 - Cindy L: Everybody hates each other
1/17/16, 16:53 - Cindy L: It's so rare to find someone who will talk to everyone
1/17/16, 16:54 - Mom: why? ur just there to study and get a degree
1/17/16, 16:55 - Mom: u can't say ppl hates each other, they just don't bother to care everything except their own
1/17/16, 16:56 - Cindy L: No I just remember one thing I really agree with now which the head of undergrad said on the first day
1/17/16, 16:56 - Cindy L: Was that u really learn a lot more abt the world if u just go around lse talking to different people
1/17/16, 16:56 - Cindy L: U don't actually get that much from the actual course itself
1/17/16, 16:57 - Cindy L: I mean I can Google up half the stuff I study
1/17/16, 16:57 - Mom: he's so frank
1/17/16, 16:58 - Mom: but was he saying that lse is a shit uni
1/17/16, 16:58 - Mom: hahahaha
1/17/16, 16:59 - Cindy L: Well he was kinda encouraging people to go out and meet other people
1/17/16, 16:59 - Cindy L: Like he said there's only so much you can learn from the books
1/17/16, 16:59 - Cindy L: I reinterpreted everything üòÅ
1/17/16, 17:00 - Mom: yea the positive side is like that
1/17/16, 17:00 - Mom: good positive thinking
1/17/16, 17:00 - Cindy L: There's positive and negative to everything no use thinking abt it
1/17/16, 17:00 - Cindy L: Or arguing abt it either
1/17/16, 17:01 - Cindy L: That's why advertising can exist
1/17/16, 17:01 - Mom: no, i mean if u only think of the positive side of even the most negative stuff, then u might be able to turn things in a way as u thought
1/17/16, 17:01 - Mom: that's the power of positive thinking
1/17/16, 17:02 - Cindy L: ....
1/17/16, 17:02 - Cindy L: I don't get it
1/17/16, 17:02 - Mom: u'll get some day
1/17/16, 17:02 - Mom: get it
1/17/16, 17:02 - Cindy L: My reinterpretation is the negative way.
1/17/16, 17:02 - Cindy L: Cuz if there's only u can learn from the course
1/17/16, 17:02 - Cindy L: U don't do the work
1/17/16, 17:03 - Cindy L: Because it's not as valuable as getting more db contacts
1/17/16, 17:03 - Cindy L: Fb
1/17/16, 17:03 - Cindy L: What u mean to say is the guy expressed it in a positive, nice way
1/17/16, 17:03 - Cindy L: I'm just a realisy
1/17/16, 17:04 - Cindy L: Realist
1/17/16, 17:05 - Mom: i'm saying that u HAVE to think in a way as ur undergrad head, otherwise u wud be learning nothing from lse
1/17/16, 17:05 - Cindy L: Right
1/17/16, 17:05 - Cindy L: I see what u mean
1/17/16, 17:05 - Mom: and this is no good for character development
1/17/16, 17:05 - Cindy L: No u always learn stuff
1/17/16, 17:05 - Cindy L: That's why I never wanted to travel back in time.
1/17/16, 17:05 - Cindy L: Until something very bad happened.
1/17/16, 17:06 - Cindy L: Was it worth the lessons learnt though?
1/17/16, 17:06 - Cindy L: Hmmm something i am still thinking abt
1/17/16, 17:07 - Mom: then take ur time to think abt it
1/17/16, 17:08 - Mom: tbh, lse is not that bad
1/17/16, 17:08 - Mom: it's still a good uni
1/17/16, 17:08 - Cindy L: Yeah
1/17/16, 17:08 - Mom: üòÅ
1/17/16, 17:08 - Cindy L: So that's why I thought OK just getting out of government is good enough for me
1/17/16, 17:08 - Cindy L: Hahahaha
1/17/16, 17:08 - Cindy L: Cuz gov is pain
1/17/16, 17:08 - Cindy L: And slow death

1/17/16, 17:45 - Cindy L: I'm thinking if I should get a plan
1/17/16, 17:45 - Cindy L: Cuz right now I hv to pay every month as well
1/17/16, 17:45 - Mom: cheaper for a plan?
1/17/16, 17:45 - Cindy L: The machine is 0
1/17/16, 17:45 - Cindy L: But I dunno
1/17/16, 17:45 - Cindy L: 24 months
1/17/16, 17:46 - Mom: but if machine 0, monthly plan fee wud be much higher
1/17/16, 17:46 - Mom: u hv to compute the total costs in each case
1/17/16, 17:46 - Cindy L: Yea so I just factor in phone cost

1/17/16, 17:47 - Cindy L: I definitely can't buy an ipgone
1/17/16, 17:47 - Cindy L: Iphone
1/17/16, 17:47 - Cindy L: U keep droppingit
1/17/16, 17:47 - Cindy L: I keep dropping it
1/17/16, 17:47 - Mom: machine cost + monthly plan = ? vs total contract monthly plan cost + machine 0
1/17/16, 17:50 - Cindy L: Huh I remember its abt the same.
1/17/16, 17:51 - Cindy L: Most people tell u to just buy the phone
1/17/16, 17:51 - Mom: but here in hk, the 0 machine plan is usually higher in total cost
1/17/16, 17:52 - Mom: so buying a phone directly is cheaper
1/17/16, 17:52 - Mom: but is that the case in uk?
1/17/16, 17:53 - Cindy L: Yes that's what I'm trying to say
1/17/16, 17:54 - Cindy L: I wish the neck massager had more connection point s or was bigger

1/18/16, 11:54 - Mom: they want to do it again?
1/18/16, 11:55 - Cindy L: They would rather be at that workload
1/18/16, 11:55 - Mom: they thought their workload now at uni is too heavy that they can't even bear?
1/18/16, 11:56 - Cindy L: Anyways I think I nearly snapped yesterday when the Indian girl came in while I was cooking

1/18/16, 11:59 - Cindy L: I already said an internal fuck u to myself
1/18/16, 11:59 - Cindy L: And then she started complaining abt how she really doesn't feel very good and that she feels faint

1/18/16, 12:03 - Cindy L: So alas
1/18/16, 12:03 - Mom: then just ask her to wait
1/18/16, 12:03 - Cindy L: But I left afterwards cuz even looking at her face made me pissed

1/18/16, 12:05 - Mom: did she ever ask other person to teach her how to do stuff?
1/18/16, 12:05 - Cindy L: If I say fuck you I'm using the kitchen, fuck off. There are gonna be complications.
1/18/16, 12:05 - Cindy L: Yea

1/18/16, 12:09 - Cindy L: This person is just so incapable u can't even imagine
1/18/16, 12:09 - Cindy L: Apparently in India they live in giant mansions with like a hundred servants who follow you where ever you go
1/18/16, 12:10 - Cindy L: I'm not kidding
1/18/16, 12:10 - Mom: u didn't do anything wrong, but u must learn to be calm and apathetic to something which doesn't matter ur fortune
1/18/16, 12:10 - Cindy L: You know the joke where HK kids don't know that apples are red and that bananas are yellow?
1/18/16, 12:11 - Mom: i get what u mean abt that girl, but does it matter me? i don't rlly care
1/18/16, 12:11 - Cindy L: So I was chopping a brown onion... And she came along and asked me what it was
1/18/16, 12:11 - Cindy L: I told her it was onion
1/18/16, 12:11 - Cindy L: She didn't believe me cuz the onions she uses are redm
1/18/16, 12:11 - Cindy L: üòÇ
1/18/16, 12:11 - Mom: if i were u, i don't tell her it's onion, i wud say others
1/18/16, 12:12 - Cindy L: Yea she thought it was garlic at first
1/18/16, 12:12 - Mom: she's actually a princess, how can u talk to a princess in a normal way
1/18/16, 12:12 - Cindy L: So the Brit guy and the older guy really hates her as well next door
1/18/16, 12:13 - Mom: see everybody just show their own emotion except u
1/18/16, 12:13 - Mom: then she approaches u all the time
1/18/16, 12:13 - Cindy L: Yea they complain to me not her facr
1/18/16, 12:13 - Cindy L: That's why I know
1/18/16, 12:13 - Cindy L: She also bugs the Russian girl
1/18/16, 12:14 - Mom: so as i said if i were u, i wudn't tell her the correct thing
1/18/16, 12:14 - Cindy L: Sure
1/18/16, 12:14 - Cindy L: Then she'll blow us up with her pressure cooker
1/18/16, 12:14 - Mom: i think the indian girl can sense that nobody likes her
1/18/16, 12:15 - Mom: why don't u tell the security stuff at ur dorm that somebody is bringing in a pressure cooker which is so dangerous
1/18/16, 12:16 - Cindy L: They allow pressure cookers here
1/18/16, 12:16 - Cindy L: Cuz students aren't as smart as imperial kids here
1/18/16, 12:17 - Cindy L: Anyways whatever.
1/18/16, 12:17 - Cindy L: That's yesterday's funny story
1/18/16, 12:18 - Cindy L: And also that people have to hide in our kitchen cuz the guy next can't shut his bitch up when he fucks her
1/18/16, 12:19 - Cindy L: The Singaporean finds it funny
1/18/16, 12:19 - Cindy L: I wanna just blow them up
1/18/16, 12:19 - Mom: üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
1/18/16, 12:19 - Cindy L: See what I mean by needing a hole

1/18/16, 14:06 - Cindy L: Hey
1/18/16, 14:07 - Cindy L: Eeg alpha waves are a sign of rem no?
1/18/16, 14:08 - Mom: yea
1/18/16, 14:08 - Mom: what?
1/18/16, 14:08 - Cindy L: Well I was looking at this
1/18/16, 14:08 - Cindy L: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postprandial_somnolence
1/18/16, 14:09 - Cindy L: And
1/18/16, 14:09 - Cindy L: In 2015 a study, reported in the journalErgonomics, showed that, for twenty healthy subjects, exposure to blue-enriched light during the post-lunch dip period significantly reduced the¬†EEG¬†alpha activity, and increased task performance.
1/18/16, 14:10 - Cindy L: Should I immediately by myself a blue lamp?
1/18/16, 14:10 - Cindy L: Buy
1/18/16, 14:10 - Mom: where to buy? amazon?
1/18/16, 14:11 - Mom: but isn't it blue light also comes out from computer screen?
1/18/16, 14:13 - Cindy L: Yea
1/18/16, 14:13 - Cindy L: Blue enriched light
1/18/16, 14:13 - Cindy L: Not sure what they mean exactly
1/18/16, 14:14 - Mom: k
1/18/16, 14:14 - Cindy L: Will check paper layer
1/18/16, 14:14 - Cindy L: Later
1/18/16, 14:14 - Cindy L: But I'm pretty sure sony screens are blue enriched
1/18/16, 14:14 - Cindy L: I remember I got the new laptop beginning of 2015?
1/18/16, 14:14 - Mom: so u shud buy a sony mobile phone

1/18/16, 14:16 - Cindy L: When we moved right?
1/18/16, 14:17 - Cindy L: I was wondering if prolong exposure to certain light colour will affect the brain then
1/18/16, 14:17 - Mom: dec 14 or jan/ feb 15?
1/18/16, 14:17 - Cindy L: Ok
1/18/16, 14:17 - Mom: i do think there's influence
1/18/16, 14:18 - Cindy L: I mean since obviously they can suppress alpha waves

1/20/16, 08:01 - Mom: üò∞
1/20/16, 08:03 - Cindy L: I wanna cry
1/20/16, 08:03 - Cindy L: When I went to bed I had hallucinations
1/20/16, 08:04 - Cindy L: And then I couldn't fall asleep due to anxiety
1/20/16, 08:04 - Cindy L: Until I started listening to some music I could finally sleep
1/20/16, 08:04 - Cindy L: And then I woke up at 4
1/20/16, 08:04 - Cindy L: Cuz my body was too hot
1/20/16, 08:05 - Cindy L: And I couldn't fall asleep until like 6 in the morning
1/20/16, 08:05 - Cindy L: And when I could finally get some sleep, I had a terrifying nightmare.
1/20/16, 08:06 - Mom: What hallucination?
1/20/16, 08:07 - Cindy L: I don't remember exactly, but when I was going to sleep I was extremely scared of something
1/20/16, 08:07 - Cindy L: And I kept thinking there was something at the end of my bed
1/20/16, 08:08 - Mom: Just thinking? Didn't actually see anything
1/20/16, 08:10 - Cindy L: Can we not discuss whether they were hallucinations or not
1/20/16, 08:11 - Mom: K
1/20/16, 08:11 - Cindy L: They were fucking scary and u would think u were crazy if u get that fear.
1/20/16, 08:11 - Mom: so tired now?
1/20/16, 08:11 - Cindy L: No I'm freaking terrified
1/20/16, 08:14 - Mom: Go to kitchen
1/20/16, 08:20 - Cindy L: I hv low sanity
1/20/16, 08:20 - Cindy L: I am in kitchen.
1/20/16, 08:22 - Mom: Do u hv class this morning, if not then cook some food for bkf, after that u might be able to sleep again
1/20/16, 08:23 - Mom: Perhaps go back to lse library and stay there, u might feel more secure
1/20/16, 08:30 - Cindy L: No
1/20/16, 08:31 - Cindy L: I'm not going back to sleep again
1/20/16, 08:31 - Cindy L: And I know at some point during today
1/20/16, 08:31 - Cindy L: I will hv a seizure
1/20/16, 08:32 - Mom: next time, if u rlly can't sleep find some food to eat to make u sleep better or find something to do to divert ur thought
1/20/16, 08:33 - Mom: can u try think of other stuff to keep ur mind busy?
1/20/16, 08:34 - Mom: like read recipe
1/20/16, 08:35 - Mom: ru ok now?
1/20/16, 08:35 - Mom: still terrified?
1/20/16, 08:35 - Mom: hv u received the second parcel which i sent to u?
1/20/16, 08:36 - Mom: it's neck puller
1/20/16, 08:36 - Cindy L: U know when u play survival games, there is a sanity bar
1/20/16, 08:36 - Cindy L: That bar is in the low right now for me.
1/20/16, 08:37 - Mom: how can i help?
1/20/16, 08:37 - Cindy L: I spent two hrs colouring in a snake to try to sleep
1/20/16, 08:37 - Mom: to eat cheese
1/20/16, 08:37 - Mom: u said u'll sleep when u eat cheese right?
1/20/16, 08:38 - Cindy L: I don't want to sleep right now.
1/20/16, 08:38 - Mom: ok
1/20/16, 08:38 - Mom: try other stuff that might increase ur sanity
1/20/16, 08:39 - Mom: hv u received the neck puller?
1/20/16, 08:39 - Cindy L: ... I tried to strangle somebody.
1/20/16, 08:40 - Mom: no, that's for u to adjust ur spinal position
1/20/16, 08:41 - Cindy L: As in I nearly strangled someone to death in my dream
1/20/16, 08:41 - Mom: u know, the observatory said it's going to snow in hk on saturday
1/20/16, 08:41 - Cindy L: üëèüèº
1/20/16, 08:42 - Mom: is it snowing in uk?
1/20/16, 08:42 - Cindy L: No
1/20/16, 08:43 - Mom: why don't play mahjong if can't sleep?
1/20/16, 08:43 - Mom: that's so boring, it makes u tired and sleepy
1/20/16, 08:43 - Cindy L: No I can play for two hrs
1/20/16, 08:43 - Cindy L: I even coloured in a snake for two hrs.
1/20/16, 08:44 - Mom: did u win?
1/20/16, 08:44 - Cindy L: .... No they strangled me back
1/20/16, 08:44 - Mom: i mean did u win in the mahjong game?
1/20/16, 08:45 - Mom: can i see ur sleep data last night?
1/20/16, 08:45 - Cindy L: No I didn't play mahjong I coloured in a snake
1/20/16, 08:46 - Mom: i mean next time don't go colouring snake, play mahjong
1/20/16, 08:46 - Mom: then u can concentrate on the game, not ur surroundings or other stuff
1/20/16, 08:47 - Cindy L: Colouring in the snake was supposed to help me concentrate
1/20/16, 08:48 - Cindy L: My point is it took two hrs of therapeutic activity for me to go to sleep again.
1/20/16, 08:48 - Mom: but ur thought will be concentrated on snake thingy which is not very good
1/20/16, 08:48 - Mom: i get ur point already
1/20/16, 08:48 - Mom: i'm trying to tell u that u can try some other stuff instead of just colouring\
1/20/16, 08:49 - Mom: bc different activities wud hv different effect on ur concentration
1/20/16, 08:49 - Cindy L: The watch didn't collect any data
1/20/16, 08:49 - Cindy L: Cuz I barely slept
1/20/16, 08:49 - Mom: why?
1/20/16, 08:50 - Mom: even if u didn't sleep, the watch should show awake, right?
1/20/16, 08:50 - Cindy L: I already said because my body was very hot
1/20/16, 08:50 - Cindy L: No
1/20/16, 08:50 - Cindy L: The watch needs to register sleep
1/20/16, 08:50 - Cindy L: It's not an eeg
1/20/16, 08:51 - Mom: then that watch is like a toy
1/20/16, 08:51 - Cindy L: U r a toy
1/20/16, 08:51 - Mom: ur body is hot bc of the adrenaline, i think
1/20/16, 08:53 - Mom: ur adrenaline system has tag a wrong internal clock that makes u getting hot in the mid-night instead of morning, and that's why u feel tired and sleepy in the morning
1/20/16, 08:53 - Cindy L: The watch measures sleep by reading changes in heart rate
1/20/16, 08:54 - Mom: ok
1/20/16, 08:54 - Cindy L: Not its just my butt and thigh and back area
1/20/16, 08:55 - Cindy L: The upper torso is normal and super cold.
1/20/16, 08:55 - Mom: did u sleep on ur bed or on ur side?
1/20/16, 08:56 - Mom: on ur back
1/20/16, 08:56 - Cindy L: Side
1/20/16, 08:56 - Mom: heating?
1/20/16, 08:56 - Mom: i mean heater on?
1/20/16, 08:56 - Mom: and window closed?
1/20/16, 08:57 - Cindy L: I dunno I don't control the heater now do i
1/20/16, 08:57 - Cindy L: I always open my window
1/20/16, 08:57 - Cindy L: So that's a redundant question
1/20/16, 08:58 - Mom: we're not arguing right?
1/20/16, 08:59 - Mom: u just said ur heart rate has raised, this is a fact that ur adrenaline lvl has raised as well
1/20/16, 09:00 - Cindy L: I never raise my hr had increased
1/20/16, 09:00 - Cindy L: I never said
1/20/16, 09:01 - Mom: the sleep watch registers ur sleep according to ur heart rate
1/20/16, 09:01 - Cindy L: Doesn't mean it increases
1/20/16, 09:01 - Cindy L: I only said changes
1/20/16, 09:01 - Mom: u know when ur in sleep time, ur heart rate is decreased so that the sleep watch knows ur sleeping
1/20/16, 09:01 - Cindy L: And also in blood pressure
1/20/16, 09:03 - Mom: if ur body gets heater, there must be more blood flow in those areas and it must be ur brain to tell ur heart beat faster to increase blood flow, am i right?
1/20/16, 09:03 - Mom: heat won't come from outside ur body
1/20/16, 09:03 - Cindy L: Do u think I should go see the counsellor?
1/20/16, 09:05 - Mom: to tell what?
1/20/16, 09:05 - Mom: ur sleep prob?
1/20/16, 09:05 - Mom: ur anixety?
1/20/16, 09:05 - Cindy L: All
1/20/16, 09:06 - Mom: what wud u expect her to offer in return, i mean what kind of help
1/20/16, 09:07 - Mom: hv u thought of returning to hk's universities?
1/20/16, 09:07 - Cindy L: Nothing I just want another human being to understand my pain.
1/20/16, 09:08 - Mom: my thought is that: if u tell the lse consellor, she def wud ask to go seek medical help from nhs
1/20/16, 09:09 - Cindy L: So
1/20/16, 09:09 - Mom: they might also offer a varieties of psychiatric counselling session to u to try to help u ease ur prob, but then u hv to talk, talk, talk all abt ur prob again again and again
1/20/16, 09:10 - Mom: like what u did b4 getting ur diagnosis in hk, don't u feel tired of just talking talking and talking
1/20/16, 09:10 - Mom: and at the end, without any solid help?
1/20/16, 09:11 - Cindy L: Sometimes I feel that u and my father are not very human.
1/20/16, 09:12 - Mom: then come back to hk for universities, that's the only way i can think of now
1/20/16, 09:12 - Mom: then i can take care of u and ur sister altogether
1/20/16, 09:12 - Cindy L: I don't demand a solution.
1/20/16, 09:13 - Mom: u know, we don't hv relatives in uk to look after ur situation
1/20/16, 09:15 - Mom: think abt the money involved in future medical expenses if ur not insured
1/20/16, 09:15 - Mom: this is a realistic prob
1/20/16, 09:15 - Cindy L: What the fuck are u saying?
1/20/16, 09:16 - Mom: if u tell the nhs abt ur previous health, ur def not insured, how can i not thinking of the money prob?
1/20/16, 09:16 - Cindy L: R u even talking like a human being right now?
1/20/16, 09:17 - Mom: so what do u want?
1/20/16, 09:17 - Cindy L: I'm gonna go sleep
1/20/16, 09:18 - Mom: u better go running la
1/20/16, 09:48 - Mom: hey, tell me how not human i am?
1/20/16, 11:42 - Cindy L: Like
Person a: I had a bad day today
Normal response: why? What happened?? Poor you.
You: what do you want me to do abt it? What do you want from me?
Dad: (runs away)
1/20/16, 11:43 - Cindy L: But never mind I just slept a bit. The fear response probably just made me a bit sensitive
1/20/16, 11:43 - Cindy L: So I went cray cray
1/20/16, 11:43 - Cindy L: One thing I forgot to mention
1/20/16, 11:44 - Cindy L: When I was trying to sleep yesterday, .. How to explain
1/20/16, 11:45 - Cindy L: Like sudden intense irrational fear of something.
1/20/16, 11:45 - Cindy L: And I felt so many sharp electrical signals.
1/20/16, 11:46 - Cindy L: At one point my left hand started to freeze (I.e. muscle tension)
1/20/16, 11:47 - Cindy L: That is so obviously the adrenal response fight or flight
1/20/16, 11:47 - Cindy L: My amygdala is probably getting bigger too damnit
1/20/16, 11:48 - Cindy L: These 'fear' sessions just come suddenly
1/20/16, 11:48 - Cindy L: Not sure if they're the same as anxiety attacks.
1/20/16, 11:49 - Cindy L: I remember the girl who transferred in yr12 has anxiety attacks and she didn't go to school for a long time.
1/20/16, 11:50 - Cindy L: OK I checked
1/20/16, 11:50 - Cindy L: Yea Im having mild anxiety attacks
1/20/16, 11:51 - Cindy L: That sudden intense irrational fear
1/20/16, 11:51 - Cindy L: This is new
1/20/16, 11:51 - Cindy L: üòû
1/20/16, 11:52 - Cindy L: I've had a few so far
1/20/16, 11:52 - Cindy L: Maybe less than five
1/20/16, 11:52 - Cindy L: Less than three
1/20/16, 11:52 - Cindy L: Two or three
1/20/16, 11:53 - Cindy L: I definitely remember them always happening when I go to sleep
1/20/16, 11:54 - Cindy L: Like the moment I turn the light off and then I hv to turn it on light again in attempt to stop the intense fear
1/20/16, 11:57 - Cindy L: And yesterday I also collapsed on the ground from surprising and laughing
1/20/16, 11:57 - Cindy L: Surprised
1/20/16, 12:37 - Mom: 1)  u had a bad day today - woke up from a nightmare and so scary
1/20/16, 12:39 - Mom: my response:  1)  i understood how scary ur and didn't want to talk abt ur experience, so i tried to talk abt other stuff trying to divert ur mindset at that moment
1/20/16, 12:40 - Mom: 2)  I had been trying to suggest alternatives to ease ur worry and scary, but u seemed not listening, u seemed just want to talk abt how scary ur
1/20/16, 12:42 - Mom: 3)  ok, i realised that ur not trying to take advice, so i just want u to understand what alternatives and their consequences might bring in
1/20/16, 12:43 - Mom: 4)  u didn't get my msg and intention, and starting to become angry and complain
1/20/16, 12:48 - Mom: 5)  what else can i do? the question: "what do u want me to do abt ur situation?" is the last resort i can do to ask u to face ur current prob? actually, i rlly can't do nothing to help ur sleep prob cuz ur in uk now and i'm in hk, and this is in fact my difficulties not being able to give up a warm hug
1/20/16, 12:51 - Mom: 6) i think ur behaviour b4 only comes from ur inability to control ur emotion at that moment cuz ur rlly frightened by ur nightmare
1/20/16, 12:52 - Mom: 7)  unless u want to stick with the psychiatric med, u still hv to hv a well-organised, regular daily activities/sleep/rest schedule
1/20/16, 12:56 - Mom: 8) do u want to suspense ur current studies? still thought of going to a new uni? all depends on how u can organise ur emotion which nobody can help even the medicine
1/20/16, 12:57 - Mom: 9) think abt a situation: if u were me, how and what wud u do? u don't hv to answer me, just think it
1/20/16, 12:58 - Mom: 10 ) and finally, i'm not going to reply any msg today

1/21/16, 03:08 - Cindy L: I woke from nightmare again.
1/21/16, 03:09 - Cindy L: I hv a feeling this is gonna go on for a while...

1/21/16, 03:14 - Cindy L: I'm eating cheese right now
1/21/16, 03:14 - Mom: just saying, if ur sleeping not very well and woke up with headache, perhaps that's the bad ventilation inside ur room
1/21/16, 03:15 - Mom: this usually happens in winter cuz u've heater inside ur room
1/21/16, 03:15 - Cindy L: No most times I hv nightmare my head hurts.
1/21/16, 03:16 - Mom: if ventilation is not good inside the room, it also makes u having bad dreams
1/21/16, 03:16 - Mom: just my experience
1/21/16, 03:16 - Cindy L: I open my windows though
1/21/16, 03:16 - Cindy L: Should I open my door as well
1/21/16, 03:16 - Cindy L: I could.

1/21/16, 03:19 - Cindy L: I eat it before bed
1/21/16, 03:19 - Mom: get a bit more cuz that contains melatonin
1/21/16, 03:20 - Cindy L: ....

1/21/16, 03:26 - Cindy L: Things to do with fire
1/21/16, 03:26 - Cindy L: No
1/21/16, 03:26 - Cindy L: More like
1/21/16, 03:26 - Cindy L: The devil
1/21/16, 03:27 - Mom: u were caught and tortured by devil?
1/21/16, 03:27 - Cindy L: There was also a rollercoaster ride
1/21/16, 03:27 - Cindy L: No
1/21/16, 03:27 - Cindy L: Its never that straight forward
1/21/16, 03:27 - Cindy L: Oh I couldn't wake up from inside the dream either.
1/21/16, 03:28 - Mom: u mean u've dreams inside ur dream?
1/21/16, 03:28 - Cindy L: No
1/21/16, 03:28 - Cindy L: As in I can't wake up from the dream myself
1/21/16, 03:28 - Cindy L: Normally I can
1/21/16, 03:29 - Cindy L: I remember crawling around in the dark cuz I couldn't walk, screaming.
1/21/16, 03:29 - Mom: u meant even in critical time, ur still in the dream and it went on going
1/21/16, 03:30 - Cindy L: Yea sort of
1/21/16, 03:30 - Cindy L: Yea
1/21/16, 03:32 - Mom: so ur just in the darkness without any help in ur dream instead of seeing something scary, right?  and the feeling makes u frightened?
1/21/16, 03:32 - Cindy L: Yea
1/21/16, 03:32 - Cindy L: That's really scary u know
1/21/16, 03:32 - Cindy L: Plus all the other batshit scary stuff which happened before
1/21/16, 03:33 - Mom: do u think this is kind of emotional stress instead of physical stress?
1/21/16, 03:33 - Cindy L: Ofc its emotional stress
1/21/16, 03:34 - Cindy L: It's translating into physical stress
1/21/16, 03:34 - Mom: but my point is u actually didn't see anything, its just ur feeling that scared u
1/21/16, 03:34 - Cindy L: Hence the anxiety attacks.
1/21/16, 03:34 - Mom: if this is the case, u hv to learn to relax and calm ur mindset down
1/21/16, 03:34 - Mom: go do meditation
1/21/16, 03:35 - Cindy L: No there were a lot of actually scary and freaky shit happening before me crawling around in the dark
1/21/16, 03:35 - Cindy L: OK I only woke up because I anticipated worse things.
1/21/16, 03:36 - Cindy L: And I was trying to get away from some monster a well
1/21/16, 03:36 - Cindy L: As usual
1/21/16, 03:36 - Cindy L: In most of my dream I'm always trying to get away from something or being chased or running away.
1/21/16, 03:36 - Cindy L: Dreams
1/21/16, 03:37 - Mom: i can imagine that ur situation is just a toddler waking up from nightmare in the middle of the  night, and usually the best comfort is someone from ur family to give u a hug
1/21/16, 03:37 - Mom: so i don't think drug in this case wud help
1/21/16, 03:37 - Cindy L: Yep actually that's exactly the situation
1/21/16, 03:37 - Cindy L: In the nightmare
1/21/16, 03:38 - Cindy L: I saw something in bed
1/21/16, 03:38 - Cindy L: And then I knew it was bad
1/21/16, 03:38 - Cindy L: So I tried to get away and find help
1/21/16, 03:38 - Mom: so poor
1/21/16, 03:38 - Cindy L: Alas my legs won't work so I had to drag my body to the corridor
1/21/16, 03:38 - Cindy L: Which was in the dark
1/21/16, 03:39 - Mom: learn to fight back the bad feeling
1/21/16, 03:39 - Cindy L: And I kept screaming to try to wake up, but I don't think my voice came out either
1/21/16, 03:39 - Cindy L: Yea I need to learn how to lucid dream
1/21/16, 03:39 - Mom: sure la cuz ur in a dream
1/21/16, 03:40 - Cindy L: That's not doable in a few nights
1/21/16, 03:40 - Cindy L: What worries me is the anxiety attacks.
1/21/16, 03:41 - Cindy L: I also feel electrical zaps in my brain
1/21/16, 03:41 - Mom: u hv to learn to fight ur emotion otherwise u'll be trapped in this situation for long time
1/21/16, 03:42 - Mom: firstly, just try ignore these bad feeling, tell ur brain that its normal, not big deal
1/21/16, 03:42 - Mom: then ur bad feeling can't go further
1/21/16, 03:43 - Mom: most important is that u must try
1/21/16, 03:44 - Mom: cuz in any case nobody can help except urself
1/21/16, 03:47 - Cindy L: Kay.
1/21/16, 03:53 - Mom: read more abt the misfortune stories, ppl in that situation still strike to survive, which should give u strength to fight ur emotion, i trust
1/21/16, 10:38 - Cindy L: I almost had another one
1/21/16, 10:38 - Cindy L: I was watching scary shows on the TV and I couldn't look away
1/21/16, 10:39 - Cindy L: I remember one of them was called 'us and them'
1/21/16, 10:39 - Cindy L: And then I woke up at 6am.
1/21/16, 10:40 - Mom: is that ur dream?
1/21/16, 10:41 - Mom: even dreaming and watch scary movies?
1/21/16, 13:37 - Cindy L: Yea
1/21/16, 13:37 - Cindy L: That's my dream
1/21/16, 13:40 - Mom: don't watch scary movies la
1/21/16, 13:41 - Mom: watch sad movies la, then u won't hv nightmare and cause cataplexy

1/22/16, 13:05 - Mom: so whats important
1/22/16, 13:05 - Cindy L: The brain is fucking connected to the immune system
1/22/16, 13:05 - Cindy L: It doesn't even go through the bbb
1/22/16, 13:06 - Cindy L: I fucking injected myself with iggs.
1/22/16, 13:07 - Cindy L: Genius!
1/22/16, 13:07 - Cindy L: Can we go sue them now.
1/22/16, 13:08 - Mom: oh yea, i remember that i've read something abt the brain is connected to a separate lymph system, did i send u the paper?
1/22/16, 13:09 - Cindy L: This one is from July 2015
1/22/16, 13:09 - Cindy L: So I dunno
1/22/16, 13:10 - Cindy L: My orexins could seriously be dead
1/22/16, 13:11 - Mom: i'll go find that paper and send it to u
1/22/16, 13:12 - Cindy L: I think I should seriously do a spinal tap
1/22/16, 13:12 - Mom: that's why i've reservation at that moment, but i also can't risk ur treatment opportunity if there rlly is
1/22/16, 13:12 - Mom: this is tough
1/22/16, 13:14 - Cindy L: What? To get a spinal tap?
1/22/16, 13:14 - Cindy L: I'm sure if u pay enough u can get one.
1/22/16, 13:15 - Cindy L: And don't think abt the gene sequencing test
1/22/16, 13:15 - Mom: actually at that moment, we shudn't be so rush for a medical treatment bc even those doctors didn't know much abt the diagnosis
1/22/16, 13:15 - Cindy L: It's not helpful since my case is not genetic
1/22/16, 13:16 - Cindy L: Unless u count the fact that dad is mildly autistic
1/22/16, 13:16 - Cindy L: Lol don't tell him that
1/22/16, 13:16 - Cindy L: This is not medical treatment
1/22/16, 13:16 - Cindy L: This is collecting recorda
1/22/16, 13:16 - Cindy L: Records
1/22/16, 13:17 - Cindy L: Before it changes
1/22/16, 13:17 - Cindy L: Cuz it might
1/22/16, 13:18 - Cindy L: Btw do u know how to read raw eeg data?
1/22/16, 13:18 - Cindy L: Lol
1/22/16, 13:18 - Mom: how wud i know?
1/22/16, 13:19 - Mom: pmh didn't even give us an eeg report
1/22/16, 13:20 - Cindy L: No what abt the one from the neurologist?
1/22/16, 13:21 - Cindy L: I dunno I thought maybe u learnt to do so while I was gone
1/22/16, 13:21 - Mom: u did do an eeg at neuro Wong
1/22/16, 13:21 - Mom: didn't
1/22/16, 13:21 - Cindy L: Yea I did
1/22/16, 13:22 - Mom: when?
1/22/16, 13:22 - Cindy L: Test for seizure
1/22/16, 13:22 - Cindy L: He tested me for epillepsy
1/22/16, 13:22 - Cindy L: I rmb
1/22/16, 13:22 - Mom: is that eeg report?
1/22/16, 13:22 - Cindy L: Yes
1/22/16, 13:23 - Cindy L: The one with all the waves
1/22/16, 13:23 - Mom: oh yea, it is
1/22/16, 13:23 - Cindy L: Face palm.
1/22/16, 13:23 - Cindy L: Have u scanned it?
1/22/16, 13:24 - Mom: i think an ordinary person doesn't know how to read it from its face
1/22/16, 13:28 - Mom: <Media omitted>
1/22/16, 13:28 - Mom: <Media omitted>
1/22/16, 13:28 - Mom: <Media omitted>
1/22/16, 13:28 - Mom: <Media omitted>
1/22/16, 13:28 - Mom: <Media omitted>
1/22/16, 13:28 - Mom: <Media omitted>
1/22/16, 13:29 - Mom: <Media omitted>
1/22/16, 13:33 - Cindy L: Yea I was just wondering
1/22/16, 13:34 - Mom: and remember that we're the one telling the doctors that ur suffering from narcolepsy, we've already given them a pre-disposition
1/22/16, 13:35 - Cindy L: What do the small words on the grey side bar say?
1/22/16, 13:36 - Mom: <Media omitted>
1/22/16, 13:37 - Cindy L: OK I think those r the names of the sensor positions
1/22/16, 13:38 - Mom: no idea
1/22/16, 13:39 - Mom: probably yes
1/22/16, 13:40 - Cindy L: There's not much study into laughter and happy feelings
1/22/16, 13:41 - Cindy L: Just chums writing abt the power of laughter and positive thinking
1/22/16, 13:41 - Cindy L: Lots abt anxiety and fear though
1/22/16, 13:42 - Mom: bc ppl don't even know which part of the brain regulates laughter
1/22/16, 13:42 - Cindy L: Too many
1/22/16, 13:43 - Mom: hv u read anything abt the brain's function on happy and laughter?
1/22/16, 13:44 - Cindy L: No just chums writing abt it like I said.
1/22/16, 13:44 - Cindy L: And those neurotransmitters
1/22/16, 13:44 - Cindy L: Serotonin, dopamine
1/22/16, 13:44 - Cindy L: There's one more.
1/22/16, 13:44 - Cindy L: Can't rmb
1/22/16, 13:44 - Cindy L: Adrenaline
1/22/16, 13:44 - Cindy L: Yes
1/22/16, 13:45 - Cindy L: But these regulate pleasant feelings
1/22/16, 13:45 - Cindy L: Not really happy
1/22/16, 13:45 - Cindy L: Or surprise
1/22/16, 13:46 - Mom: adrenaline concerns with flight/fight emotions, right?
1/22/16, 13:47 - Cindy L: Yea adrenaline regulates the whole system
1/22/16, 13:47 - Cindy L: Which is confusing like how can one chemical do so many things?
1/22/16, 13:48 - Mom: no, not one chemical affects so many things, it's many different chemicals affect many response altogether
1/22/16, 13:49 - Mom: and scientists even can't quite sure which one correspond to which emotion
1/22/16, 13:49 - Cindy L: Yes
1/22/16, 13:49 - Cindy L: That is right
1/22/16, 13:51 - Cindy L: U know I re
1/22/16, 13:51 - Mom: i used to negate taking drug at this stage, u rmb bc as i read more, i just find out those psych med ususally can't cure the prob but instead make it complicated
1/22/16, 13:51 - Cindy L: I read so many of these science papers
1/22/16, 13:52 - Cindy L: And I realise most of them aren't even coming from those 'top' unis
1/22/16, 13:52 - Cindy L: I.e. I haven't even seen a single paper from mit
1/22/16, 13:52 - Cindy L: I swear
1/22/16, 13:53 - Mom: is mit specialize in medical science?
1/22/16, 13:53 - Cindy L: And people in imperial are researching abt the tensile strength of fucking cheese
1/22/16, 13:53 - Mom: or just mechanical stuff?
1/22/16, 13:53 - Cindy L: MIT does all sciences
1/22/16, 13:53 - Cindy L: They have a neuroscience dept
1/22/16, 13:54 - Cindy L: Neither hv I seen a ucl paper
1/22/16, 13:54 - Cindy L: I thoguht they were first in the world
1/22/16, 13:55 - Mom: so, what can we if they don't produce neuro research paper?
1/22/16, 13:56 - Cindy L: What just an interesting thing I noticed
1/22/16, 13:56 - Cindy L: <Media omitted>
1/22/16, 13:56 - Cindy L: Related to the earlier article
1/22/16, 13:58 - Mom: http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/294965.php
1/22/16, 13:58 - Mom: i read this b4
1/22/16, 13:59 - Cindy L: Yea its the same article
1/22/16, 14:00 - Cindy L: Seems like its pretty easy for the BBB to be vulnerable
1/22/16, 14:01 - Cindy L: Perhaps I had inflammation in my brain.
1/22/16, 14:01 - Mom: u mean now or b4?
1/22/16, 14:01 - Cindy L: B4
1/22/16, 14:03 - Mom: possible, rmb that u had done a blood test at neuro Wong abt how fast ur red blood cell sink, and the result showed that u had inflammation
1/22/16, 14:04 - Mom: at that time, neuro Wong explained that it might be ur eczema
1/22/16, 14:05 - Mom: but if ur brain had inflammation b4, the injection of iggs shud theoretically help to reduce inflammation
1/22/16, 14:05 - Mom: then u shud be better after the injection, but not getting worse
1/22/16, 14:08 - Cindy L: But isn't inflammation increased amount of igg
1/22/16, 14:09 - Cindy L: And we still don't know how ivig works theoretically
1/22/16, 14:10 - Cindy L: So we don't know for certain what should happen after ivig
1/22/16, 14:10 - Cindy L: So all we know is that I hv some sort of chronic inflammation
1/22/16, 14:12 - Cindy L: doesn't inflammation cause irreversible damage?
1/22/16, 14:14 - Mom: don't exactly know
1/22/16, 14:14 - Mom: that's why i force u to take fish oil which is supposed to reduce inflammation in ur body
1/22/16, 14:14 - Cindy L: but even stroke victims can be cured.
1/22/16, 14:17 - Mom: yea, as long as we can re-activate those cell
1/22/16, 14:19 - Cindy L: did i tell u i tried meditating yesterday
1/22/16, 14:20 - Mom: no
1/22/16, 14:20 - Mom: where did u try? go to class or just do it urself?
1/22/16, 14:20 - Mom: and how u feel after?
1/22/16, 14:21 - Cindy L: i have this app
1/22/16, 14:22 - Cindy L: and i lets u know how well u are doing through this interactive weather thing
1/22/16, 14:22 - Cindy L: and u try to keep the weather calm
1/22/16, 14:22 - Cindy L: i did it yesterday
1/22/16, 14:22 - Cindy L: and had 3 mins of storms
1/22/16, 14:23 - Mom: don't get it?
1/22/16, 14:23 - Mom: what weather thingy?
1/22/16, 14:23 - Cindy L: the app measures how 'calm' u are
1/22/16, 14:24 - Mom: what does "storms" mean?
1/22/16, 14:26 - Cindy L: and on the screen u see this scene
1/22/16, 14:26 - Cindy L: and the weather will change
1/22/16, 14:26 - Cindy L: according to how calm u are
1/22/16, 14:27 - Mom: where is the screen?
1/22/16, 14:27 - Cindy L: on the phone
1/22/16, 14:27 - Cindy L: i'm talking about a mobile app
1/22/16, 14:28 - Mom: so u didn't explain "storm"
1/22/16, 14:29 - Cindy L: so stormy weather = not calm mind
1/22/16, 14:31 - Mom: so, does it reflect ur mindset yesterday?
1/22/16, 14:31 - Cindy L: my mind is always stormy
1/22/16, 14:32 - Mom: but ur app said u just hv 3 mins storms only!!
1/22/16, 14:32 - Cindy L: cuz i only attempted to meditate for 3 mins
1/22/16, 14:33 - Mom: üòÇ
1/22/16, 14:33 - Mom: 3 mins meditation = 3 mins storms
1/22/16, 14:34 - Cindy L: hahaha
1/22/16, 14:36 - Mom: so, ru going to do meditation in the long run?
1/22/16, 14:36 - Cindy L: i guess
1/22/16, 14:36 - Cindy L: i started to do colouring
1/22/16, 14:36 - Cindy L: it's surprisingly therapeutic
1/22/16, 14:36 - Cindy L: i can colour in a snake for two hours
1/22/16, 14:44 - Cindy L: omg
1/22/16, 14:44 - Cindy L: amazon is expanding
1/22/16, 14:38 - Mom: Rlly, but its boring
1/22/16, 14:40 - Mom: so, did u do colouring last mid-night?
1/22/16, 14:44 - Cindy L: no im super focused when i colour
1/22/16, 14:44 - Cindy L: hahaha
1/22/16, 14:45 - Mom: u can do 2 hrs' colouring without falling asleep?
1/22/16, 14:45 - Cindy L: yea
1/22/16, 14:45 - Cindy L: i had to deliberately put it down and go to sleep
1/22/16, 14:46 - Mom: so u def don't hv adhd
1/22/16, 14:45 - Cindy L: i also build this lego toy until 5am
1/22/16, 14:46 - Cindy L: which my friend sent me
1/22/16, 14:46 - Mom: so u didn't sleep last night, right?
1/22/16, 14:46 - Mom: wtf
1/22/16, 14:46 - Cindy L: no that was like a few nights ago
1/22/16, 14:46 - Cindy L: when i didn't have work to do
1/22/16, 14:46 - Cindy L: now i need to do work
1/22/16, 14:46 - Cindy L: unfortunately
1/22/16, 14:47 - Cindy L: i have a new math teacher
1/22/16, 14:47 - Cindy L: he's so good
1/22/16, 14:47 - Mom: wow, great for 2016
1/22/16, 14:48 - Cindy L: great now i have one less crappy teacher
1/22/16, 14:48 - Cindy L: but i still have half my body stuck in a crappy discipline
1/22/16, 14:49 - Mom: .....
1/22/16, 14:49 - Cindy L: no i mean i'm still half stuck in a crappy discipline
1/22/16, 14:50 - Mom: yea, i get that
1/22/16, 14:51 - Cindy L: oh right
1/22/16, 14:52 - Cindy L: i have to meet my adviser next week
1/22/16, 14:52 - Cindy L: shiiiiiit
1/22/16, 14:52 - Cindy L: i feel like she's gonna ask questions.
1/22/16, 14:52 - Cindy L: questions i can't answer
1/22/16, 14:54 - Mom: like what? so u'll hv to prepare for it
1/22/16, 14:55 - Cindy L: like why did u skip econ three times in a row?
1/22/16, 14:56 - Cindy L: i thought i was new term, new records üò≠
1/22/16, 14:55 - Mom: u did? why?
1/22/16, 14:56 - Cindy L: i skipped it yesterday cuz u know
1/22/16, 14:56 - Cindy L: my sanity was low
1/22/16, 14:58 - Mom: so, how wud u want to explain?
1/22/16, 14:58 - Mom: tell her ur sanity was low?
1/22/16, 14:58 - Mom: and ur emotional prob?
1/22/16, 15:03 - Cindy L: that's where i'm stuck
1/22/16, 15:03 - Cindy L: i'll just say i'm sick
1/22/16, 15:03 - Cindy L: lol
1/22/16, 15:04 - Cindy L: or i'll go consult the other first yrs in my flat.
1/22/16, 15:04 - Cindy L: haha
1/22/16, 15:04 - Mom: üëçüëç
1/22/16, 15:05 - Mom: pretty good idea
1/22/16, 15:05 - Cindy L: but if she lectures me
1/22/16, 15:05 - Mom: brain storming
1/22/16, 15:05 - Cindy L: i'll sit there and i'll want to rage.
1/22/16, 15:05 - Cindy L: cuz u know i have a short fuse
1/22/16, 15:05 - Mom: sigh
1/22/16, 15:05 - Mom: relax and keep calm
1/22/16, 15:06 - Mom: and pretend that ur deaf at that moment
1/22/16, 15:06 - Cindy L: it'll be like 3 mins of tsunamis
1/22/16, 15:07 - Mom: that's why i told u to do meditation
1/22/16, 15:07 - Mom: to learn to relax and keep calm
1/22/16, 15:07 - Cindy L: i have the right to be angry at the world.
1/22/16, 15:08 - Cindy L: okok
1/22/16, 15:08 - Cindy L: u know there are non-epileptic seizures?
1/22/16, 15:11 - Mom: u have every right to do anything u want but u also have to watch for their consequence on the society and urself
1/22/16, 15:12 - Mom: i know there're non-epileptic seizures, so what?
1/22/16, 15:12 - Cindy L: i meant i ought to be angry at the world more than the average person
1/22/16, 15:12 - Cindy L: nevermind neas are not related.
1/22/16, 15:13 - Cindy L: actually isn't cataplexy a form of nea?
1/22/16, 15:14 - Cindy L: it says they can be triggered by emotional states
1/22/16, 15:32 - Mom: hmmm, let me investigate for a little time
1/22/16, 15:39 - Cindy L: Ok I think I hv stress
1/22/16, 15:39 - Cindy L: I truly think I'm stressed out now
1/22/16, 15:46 - Mom: how's ur econ exam?
1/22/16, 16:02 - Mom: http://www.businessinsider.com/goldman-sachs-hired-2800-people-in-2015-2016-1
1/22/16, 16:18 - Mom: http://www.businessinsider.com/the-first-real-reason-we-need-to-sleep-2013-10
1/22/16, 16:18 - Mom: this link explains why we need to sleep
1/22/16, 17:04 - Cindy L: I dunno
1/22/16, 17:05 - Cindy L: But I just thought abt it
1/22/16, 17:05 - Cindy L: U know pnes is as common as ms?
1/22/16, 17:05 - Mom: pnes?
1/22/16, 17:06 - Cindy L: Psychogenic non epileptic seizures
1/22/16, 17:06 - Mom: i know pnes la
1/22/16, 17:06 - Cindy L: As common as multiple sclerosis
1/22/16, 17:07 - Mom: so, u think u hv pnes?
1/22/16, 17:10 - Cindy L: Lol I always find it funny when u go
1/22/16, 17:10 - Cindy L: So, u think u hv.....
1/22/16, 17:10 - Cindy L: What I said above
1/22/16, 17:11 - Cindy L: Isnt cataplexy a form of ones?
1/22/16, 17:11 - Cindy L: Pnes
1/22/16, 17:13 - Mom: dont know
1/22/16, 17:13 - Mom: not enough info
1/23/16, 13:17 - Cindy L: I think I should go for cbt
1/23/16, 13:18 - Cindy L: And do everything to de-stress the brain
1/23/16, 13:31 - Cindy L: Cuz stress seems to literally destroy the brain.
1/23/16, 13:31 - Cindy L: And since I hv no other paths to search might as well go down this one
1/23/16, 15:53 - Mom: where to do the cbt?
1/23/16, 15:55 - Cindy L: Dunno
1/23/16, 15:55 - Cindy L: But I found some interesting stuff on humour
1/23/16, 15:56 - Cindy L: I think the stimulus is surprise
1/23/16, 15:56 - Cindy L: Not humour
1/23/16, 15:56 - Cindy L: Because look at this person's theory
1/23/16, 15:56 - Mom: surprise cause cataplexy?
1/23/16, 15:57 - Cindy L: Yes
1/23/16, 15:57 - Cindy L: Surprise is the initial stimulus
1/23/16, 15:57 - Cindy L: because for the brain to process humour
1/23/16, 15:57 - Cindy L: it needs two components:
1/23/16, 15:57 - Cindy L: 1. cognitive - it needs to understand the meaning of the joke
1/23/16, 15:58 - Cindy L: and 2. emotional - feelings of happy and amusement produced in response
1/23/16, 15:58 - Cindy L: so the theory is that
1/23/16, 15:58 - Cindy L: surprises involve incongruity
1/23/16, 15:58 - Cindy L: this is when u receive conflicting data
1/23/16, 15:59 - Cindy L: e.g. u see a giraffe when u're in the supermarket
1/23/16, 16:00 - Cindy L: the part of the brain which interprets stimulus is the PTO
1/23/16, 16:00 - Cindy L: pto gives meaning to signals from eyes and ears and sensory organs
1/23/16, 16:00 - Cindy L: so when the brain registers incongruity
1/23/16, 16:01 - Cindy L: the pto attempts to resolve it by giving alternative interpretation
1/23/16, 16:02 - Cindy L: i.e. why is there a giraffe in the supermarket?
1/23/16, 16:02 - Cindy L: maybe its escaped
1/23/16, 16:03 - Cindy L: then resolution of this conflict produces positive feelings
1/23/16, 16:03 - Cindy L: this is the emotional bit
1/23/16, 16:03 - Cindy L: reward circuits respond by secreting neurotransmitters which make u feel happy/ amusement/ make u laugh etc.
1/23/16, 16:04 - Cindy L: therefore it makes sense for surprise to be the initial stimulus
1/23/16, 16:05 - Cindy L: also both cognitive and emotive humour components are more strongly activated in WOMEN.
1/23/16, 16:05 - Cindy L: explains why i seem to find everything hilarious
1/23/16, 16:05 - Cindy L: now linking the limbic system to the ANS
1/23/16, 16:06 - Cindy L: what happens after is either related to
1/23/16, 16:06 - Cindy L: 1. amygdala - something wrong with 'fight or flight' (which is the SNS)
1/23/16, 16:07 - Cindy L: 2. motor function - something wrong with Acetylcholine and mitchondria in the brain
1/23/16, 16:08 - Cindy L: 3. some aberrant form of REM atonia is triggered (which involves irregular production of our good old neurotransmitters)
1/23/16, 16:10 - Mom: now i don't think cataplexy is a form of rem sleep
1/23/16, 16:10 - Cindy L: porque no?
1/23/16, 16:11 - Cindy L: why not?
1/23/16, 16:11 - Cindy L: well for starters i'm not actually 'sleepy' at the moment of the episode. so that's true
1/23/16, 16:11 - Mom: rmb the link i sent u abt the h-reflex?
1/23/16, 16:11 - Cindy L: yea
1/23/16, 16:11 - Cindy L: go on
1/23/16, 16:14 - Mom: cataplexy differs from rem sleep is that MEP has no change in cataplexy, but h-reflex/MEP decrease
1/23/16, 16:16 - Cindy L: aren't h-reflex like jerks from the limbs u may get during sleep?
1/23/16, 16:17 - Mom: in fact, long ago i've already thought of the initial stimulus is "shock", but even if u can figure this, we still can't find how the emotional stimulus wud cause motor effect on ur body
1/23/16, 16:17 - Cindy L: that's why i offered 3 hypothesis afterwards.
1/23/16, 16:18 - Cindy L: i don't think there's anything wrong with motor function so it's probably not 2
1/23/16, 16:18 - Cindy L: cuz i can function normally
1/23/16, 16:18 - Mom: "mitchondria" is abt the cell energy
1/23/16, 16:18 - Mom: which i think is irrelevant in cataplexy
1/23/16, 16:19 - Cindy L: it's related to muscle movement
1/23/16, 16:19 - Mom: in fact, the function of each individual system is normal
1/23/16, 16:19 - Mom: it's the linkage that's having prob
1/23/16, 16:19 - Cindy L: yea which means it can only be either
1/23/16, 16:20 - Cindy L: 1. problems in secretion of neurotransmitters
1/23/16, 16:20 - Cindy L: 2. stress
1/23/16, 16:20 - Mom: that's why i always wonder if there's any mis-alignment of the head and the spinal cord
1/23/16, 16:21 - Cindy L: where the neurotransmitters are secreted is important
1/23/16, 16:22 - Cindy L: cuz between synapses and post-synapse have different effect.
1/23/16, 16:23 - Cindy L: i think we need to study the neurotransmitters more closely right now
1/23/16, 16:23 - Cindy L: and also the effects of stress
1/23/16, 16:25 - Mom: so now u rlly think that ur stressed at the time of yr 12?
1/23/16, 16:25 - Cindy L: yea after reading about how they interpret stress ofc i have stress
1/23/16, 16:25 - Cindy L: any slight conflicting situation is stress
1/23/16, 16:25 - Cindy L: too much stress will destroy the brain lol
1/24/16, 11:13 - Cindy L: Hii
1/24/16, 11:14 - Cindy L: I'm really bored today... üò£
1/24/16, 11:15 - Cindy L: For some reason
1/24/16, 11:15 - Cindy L: I guess it's
1/24/16, 11:15 - Cindy L: This to Amazon agaib
1/24/16, 11:56 - Emos: play restaurant city
1/24/16, 12:00 - Mom: why amazon again?
1/24/16, 12:00 - Mom: waiting for parcel?
1/24/16, 12:01 - Mom: go shopping
1/24/16, 14:56 - Cindy L: Restaurant city is down
1/24/16, 14:56 - Cindy L: Amazon as in online shopping time
1/24/16, 14:56 - Cindy L: This is so sad
1/24/16, 14:57 - Emos: tbh its so glitchy
1/24/16, 14:57 - Cindy L: I've been getting quite frequent weird ass eds episodes/ seizures today
1/24/16, 15:01 - Mom: how weird is it?
1/24/16, 16:02 - Cindy L: I sort of go to sleep but I feel like my muscles are convulsing?
1/24/16, 16:03 - Mom: whole body? or just limbs?
1/24/16, 16:04 - Mom: and how frequent is that?
1/24/16, 16:07 - Mom: and how long did convulsion last?
1/24/16, 16:13 - Mom: can u think of anything which might cause these weird episodes/seizures, like not having enough sleep last night, new food eaten, medicines, ...etc?
1/24/16, 17:09 - Cindy L: I'm reading a loy
1/24/16, 17:09 - Cindy L: Lot
1/24/16, 17:28 - Mom: ??
1/24/16, 17:29 - Mom: U read a lot and cause ur convulsions??
1/24/16, 17:51 - Cindy L: I switched off the lights to go to sleep yesterday
1/24/16, 17:51 - Cindy L: And when I was lying in bed, I immediately had a panic attack
1/24/16, 17:52 - Cindy L: Until my arms could reach up and switch on the lights
1/24/16, 17:53 - Mom: so, ru okay now?
1/24/16, 17:55 - Cindy L: Yea
1/24/16, 17:55 - Cindy L: Jist keep sleeping
1/25/16, 00:19 - Mom: Still hv seizure?
1/25/16, 01:00 - Cindy L: Probably lack of sleep I think
1/25/16, 01:01 - Cindy L: And switching off the lights causes panix attacks
1/25/16, 01:21 - Mom: relax
1/25/16, 01:21 - Mom: just wear mask with lights on
1/25/16, 13:22 - Mom: hi, how's life?
1/25/16, 14:11 - Cindy L: I hv my period

1/25/16, 16:18 - Cindy L: At least that's disappeared, hurray
1/25/16, 16:23 - Cindy L: But so much pain
1/25/16, 16:23 - Cindy L: I even took a panadol alrradyy
1/25/16, 16:27 - Mom: wash ur butt with warm water every time u got to change napkin
1/25/16, 16:27 - Mom: u might feel better that part, not so painful
1/25/16, 16:29 - Mom: that's might explain why u napped alot yesterday
1/25/16, 16:58 - Cindy L: My bathroom is quite inconvenient

1/26/16, 01:30 - Cindy L: I meant to say
1/26/16, 01:31 - Cindy L: Cataplexy seems less freq today
1/26/16, 01:31 - Cindy L: Not sure if affects of depression
1/26/16, 01:46 - Mom: never heard of baby-blue, it's hormonal effect as well
1/26/16, 01:46 - Mom: anyway, just relax
1/26/16, 09:19 - Cindy L: I'm sure less cataplexy is not an effect of baby blues
1/26/16, 09:19 - Cindy L: Yeah and I know its hormonal,  that's why I'm mentioning it
1/26/16, 09:21 - Mom: i mean ur depression may last for just a few days, not worry
1/26/16, 09:22 - Mom: u seem so worry abt ur depression and anxiety
1/26/16, 09:23 - Mom: but i just want to say that those r temporary, don't pay too much attention on them

1/26/16, 14:43 - Mom: Four simple tips to stop stress in its tracks and overcome its harmful effects on your brain.

1.  Stop free radical damage by eating a diet high in antioxidant-rich foods like fruit, vegetables, dark chocolate, and green tea.
2.  Increase levels of brain-boosting BDNF by getting daily physical exercise. It doesn‚Äôt have to be strenuous. Walking is excellent. So are exercises with strong mind-body orientations like yoga, tai chi, and qi gong.
3.  Start a daily meditation practice. Meditation not only reduces stress, it‚Äôs a proven way to keep your brain young by keeping telomeres long.
4.  Monitor your thoughts for automatic negative reactions and cognitive distortions. Stress does not come from events in your life as much as it comes from your thoughts about these events. Meditation is the best tool for learning how to master your thoughts.

1/27/16, 11:09 - Cindy L: Cuz I don't think there r any drugs which will help
1/27/16, 11:09 - Cindy L: Atn
1/27/16, 11:09 - Cindy L: Atm
1/27/16, 11:10 - Cindy L: So watching pewdiepie was not a v. good way to relieve stress last yr
1/27/16, 11:10 - Mom: yea, psy drug makes emotional prob worse
1/27/16, 11:11 - Mom: that's why i always urge u to do exercise
1/27/16, 11:11 - Cindy L: Yea I think they're too difficult to manage
1/27/16, 11:11 - Cindy L: Just exercise is not enough.
1/27/16, 11:11 - Cindy L: Need to solve the root of the stress problem
1/27/16, 11:11 - Mom: take time to do simple and slow motion exercise
1/27/16, 11:12 - Cindy L: I.e. get my arm muscles back
1/27/16, 11:12 - Mom: u don't even know what ur stress r
1/27/16, 11:12 - Cindy L: Actually I know
1/27/16, 11:12 - Cindy L: I hv a pretty good idea.

1/27/16, 11:12 - Cindy L: Mainly body image issues.
1/27/16, 11:13 - Mom: üò∞
1/27/16, 11:13 - Cindy L: And I needa get rid of my eczema scars.
1/27/16, 11:13 - Cindy L: Somehow.
1/27/16, 11:13 - Mom: don't bother those petite thing, do big prob first
1/27/16, 11:13 - Cindy L: Dude I was reading this paper
1/27/16, 11:14 - Mom: like emotion
1/27/16, 11:14 - Cindy L: And fear of the next seizure is also a source of stress
1/27/16, 11:14 - Cindy L: Yea I think I also hv that
1/27/16, 11:14 - Cindy L: Everytime I walk on the street I get that.
1/27/16, 11:14 - Cindy L: And when I'm with a grp of people its even worse.
1/27/16, 11:15 - Cindy L: Here's the thing
1/27/16, 11:15 - Mom: that's where ur stress comes
1/27/16, 11:15 - Cindy L: I also read that stress activates these basal neurons which produce more acetylcholine
1/27/16, 11:16 - Mom: yea
1/27/16, 11:16 - Cindy L: I'm actually pretty convinced it's stress which is causing irregularities in the chemicals in my brain
1/27/16, 11:17 - Cindy L: Esp if u think abt what regulates rem
1/27/16, 11:17 - Cindy L: Acetylcholibe, serotonin, noradrenaline and histamine
1/27/16, 11:18 - Cindy L: They r all highly responsive to stress
1/27/16, 11:19 - Mom: http://bebrainfit.com/effects-chronic-stress-brain/
1/27/16, 11:19 - Cindy L: Yea I know that stress pretty much destroys the brain
1/27/16, 11:19 - Mom: so relax
1/27/16, 11:20 - Cindy L: The liver and the gut are also surprisingly the most important organs in the body
1/27/16, 11:20 - Mom: and do qi gong, tai chi, yoga, meditation
1/27/16, 11:20 - Cindy L: Did u look t cbt
1/27/16, 11:20 - Cindy L: At
1/27/16, 11:20 - Cindy L: Yoga doesn't really help tbh
1/27/16, 11:20 - Cindy L: U kinda need talking therapy
1/27/16, 11:21 - Mom: sigh, u just did several mins
1/27/16, 11:21 - Cindy L: I think that's why my depression is really on and off
1/27/16, 11:21 - Cindy L: Cuz I never sorted out the stress
1/27/16, 11:21 - Mom: oh, u need to talk to ppl to relieve ur stress right?
1/27/16, 11:21 - Cindy L: Yea
1/27/16, 11:21 - Cindy L: So I thought of
1/27/16, 11:22 - Cindy L: Weirdos on skype
1/27/16, 11:22 - Cindy L: Confessional booth
1/27/16, 11:22 - Cindy L: Counsellor
1/27/16, 11:22 - Cindy L: Lol
1/27/16, 11:22 - Mom: well, talk to ur me, emos and ur friends
1/27/16, 11:22 - Cindy L: Nah, it kind of needs to be a stranger.
1/27/16, 11:22 - Mom: then confessional booth
1/27/16, 11:22 - Cindy L: I told u
1/27/16, 11:23 - Cindy L: I need a confidant hole in the ground
1/27/16, 11:23 - Mom: talk to god la
1/27/16, 11:23 - Cindy L: I need a responsive hole on the ground.
1/27/16, 11:24 - Cindy L: I think confessional booth is my best shot.
1/27/16, 11:24 - Cindy L: Lol if I can find one
1/27/16, 11:24 - Mom: hey, how can the hole be responsive?
1/27/16, 11:24 - Cindy L: Exactly
1/27/16, 11:24 - Mom: confessional booth may be the best
1/27/16, 11:24 - Cindy L: I don't think they let u in if u're not Catholic.
1/27/16, 11:24 - Mom: oh, online chat with stranger
1/27/16, 11:24 - Mom: but don't do nude chat
1/27/16, 11:25 - Cindy L: Hv u ever been on online chat?
1/27/16, 11:25 - Mom: no
1/27/16, 11:25 - Cindy L: It's just closet perverts and dick cams most of the time.
1/27/16, 11:25 - Mom: now is online chat, right?
1/27/16, 11:26 - Cindy L: I guess.
1/27/16, 11:26 - Mom: i never thought of talking my stress to a stranger
1/27/16, 11:26 - Cindy L: U talk to a stranger cuz they hv no prior impressions of u
1/27/16, 11:26 - Mom: i just watch sad movies and then i can cry
1/27/16, 11:26 - Cindy L: They don't know who u r
1/27/16, 11:26 - Cindy L: That means u still hv stress
1/27/16, 11:27 - Mom: i don't share my feeling with a stranger cuz that's so weird
1/27/16, 11:27 - Cindy L: And it's gonna kill u one day.
1/27/16, 11:27 - Cindy L: Yea
1/27/16, 11:27 - Cindy L: I guess that's true
1/27/16, 11:27 - Mom: i finished a questionnaire yesterday and i'm confirmed: no stress
1/27/16, 11:27 - Cindy L: Sure.
1/27/16, 11:28 - Cindy L: I'm pretty sure u hv stress
1/27/16, 11:28 - Mom: be apathetic to everything, then u won't hv much stress
1/27/16, 11:28 - Cindy L: Yea
1/27/16, 11:28 - Cindy L: That works too
1/27/16, 11:28 - Cindy L: Hence prozac
1/27/16, 11:29 - Cindy L: So I woke up from my dream this morning.
1/27/16, 11:29 - Cindy L: And at some point
1/27/16, 11:29 - Cindy L: I regained a bit of cognition but hadn't completely woken up
1/27/16, 11:30 - Cindy L: That was when my dream started to not make sense to me anymore.
1/27/16, 11:30 - Cindy L: Like I tried to think abt how the people and situation all linked together
1/27/16, 11:31 - Cindy L: And I just lost it, couldnt get the dream back
1/27/16, 11:31 - Cindy L: So I was thinking that
1/27/16, 11:31 - Cindy L: Maybe like when u dream
1/27/16, 11:31 - Cindy L: It's just the emotion centre of the brain running?
1/27/16, 11:32 - Cindy L: And the rational, reasoning bit shuts off
1/27/16, 11:33 - Cindy L: That's why the moment I start to wake, I go from complete understanding of the dream to it not making sense at all
1/27/16, 11:33 - Cindy L: I looked back at the content of my nightmares
1/27/16, 11:33 - Cindy L: And while I'm reading them I don't think they're scary at all.
1/27/16, 11:34 - Mom: oh, this is gd as u can be released from ur emotional disturbance
1/27/16, 11:34 - Cindy L: What do u mean?
1/27/16, 11:35 - Mom: that means u can face directly to ur actual feeling, not afraid of it
1/27/16, 11:35 - Cindy L: U mean when I read abt the content of my nightmares?
1/27/16, 11:36 - Mom: if u can understand they're just dreams/nightmares, u can isolate ur actual emotions from them, not to be confused
1/27/16, 11:37 - Cindy L: But this is when I'm conscious
1/27/16, 11:37 - Cindy L: When it's half and half, it gets confusing.
1/27/16, 11:37 - Cindy L: This morning was probably normal.
1/27/16, 11:38 - Cindy L: Like how normal people wake up from their dream
1/27/16, 11:38 - Mom: sometimes, u can't even identify whether they're dreams or real thingy in the past
1/27/16, 11:38 - Mom: what happen last night?
1/27/16, 11:38 - Cindy L: Oh that's because he amygdala processes memories as well
1/27/16, 11:39 - Mom: the amygdala does not process memories, it's the hippocampus
1/27/16, 11:39 - Cindy L: I'm pretty sure some bit processes memories and are involved in emotions as well
1/27/16, 11:40 - Cindy L: My biggest problem is still the fact that I can't maintain proper sleep cycles.
1/27/16, 11:40 - Mom: fear, anxiety, worry all the bad emotions
1/27/16, 11:41 - Cindy L: The amygdala does a shit ton of stuff dude
1/27/16, 11:41 - Mom: that's why i told u to try making a proper sleep cycle esp at night time
1/27/16, 11:42 - Mom: the amygdala is the "flight" or "fight" centre
1/27/16, 11:42 - Mom: it seems that u've stopped every exercise, right?
1/27/16, 11:43 - Cindy L: Walking?
1/27/16, 11:43 - Mom: everyday? from dorm to lse?
1/27/16, 11:43 - Cindy L: Yea
1/27/16, 11:43 - Mom: yea, probably as exercise
1/27/16, 11:43 - Cindy L: I go out everyday

1/27/16, 12:40 - Mom: wow, even nigerians can live in london, but not brits
1/27/16, 12:40 - Cindy L: no its just that brits are that unsociabl
1/27/16, 12:40 - Cindy L: unsociable
1/27/16, 12:40 - Cindy L: and its very surprising how old fashioned a lot of them are.
1/27/16, 12:41 - Cindy L: u know how there's a brit guy next door

1/27/16, 12:42 - Cindy L: i'm like are you kidding me? what kind of 20 year old does that stuff?
1/27/16, 12:43 - Mom: different culture, difficult to comment
1/27/16, 12:50 - Cindy L: Drinks wine, watches trains and talks abt politics?
1/27/16, 12:50 - Cindy L: üò¨ sounds like a grandpa.
1/27/16, 12:51 - Mom: that's brits tradition right?
1/27/16, 12:51 - Cindy L: üòü
1/27/16, 12:51 - Cindy L: ever heard of a computer?
1/27/16, 12:52 - Mom: they talk with their mouth not computer

1/27/16, 12:52 - Cindy L: start ups
1/27/16, 12:52 - Cindy L: everybody who starts a business is indian here.
1/27/16, 12:54 - Mom: ukers r like that, don't treat stem seriously
1/27/16, 12:55 - Cindy L: oh lol
1/27/16, 12:56 - Cindy L: <Media omitted>

1/27/16, 13:04 - Cindy L: that, my friend,
1/27/16, 13:04 - Cindy L: is a floppy disk

1/27/16, 13:06 - Cindy L: mopps its a joke
1/27/16, 13:06 - Cindy L: don't spoil the joke
1/27/16, 13:06 - Cindy L: that's why its funny
1/27/16, 13:06 - Mom: so, it's like uk's stem
1/27/16, 13:06 - Cindy L: funny things don't make sense
1/27/16, 13:07 - Cindy L: yea that was the second joke i was trying to make
1/27/16, 13:07 - Cindy L: so there were two jokes in total
1/27/16, 13:07 - Cindy L: see how amazing the brain is
1/27/16, 13:08 - Cindy L: it can discern all of that in less than 3 seconds
1/27/16, 13:09 - Mom: i was reading abt this: MA(RCA)/MSc in Innovation Design Engineering (IDE) a new course at imperial
1/27/16, 13:09 - Cindy L: yea but its master
1/27/16, 13:09 - Cindy L: the design school has a few master programs
1/27/16, 13:10 - Mom: seems they're trying to expand in this area
1/27/16, 13:10 - Cindy L: yea because there is demand
1/27/16, 13:10 - Cindy L: and demand naturally creates supply
1/27/16, 13:10 - Cindy L: llook at how good my econ is
1/27/16, 13:10 - Cindy L: üòÇ
1/27/16, 13:11 - Mom: only if the graduate can find jobs in this area, otherwise no demand
1/27/16, 13:11 - Cindy L: but companies are already tapping into those imperial grads
1/27/16, 13:11 - Cindy L: oh btw
1/27/16, 13:11 - Mom: regret that u didn't take econ at ib
1/27/16, 13:11 - Cindy L: my friend said that
1/27/16, 13:11 - Cindy L: imp grads tend to go back to research
1/27/16, 13:11 - Cindy L: cuz they work at too high level
1/27/16, 13:12 - Cindy L: also the difference between cambridge eng and imperial eng
1/27/16, 13:12 - Cindy L: is that cambridge eng is just theory
1/27/16, 13:12 - Cindy L: lol
1/27/16, 13:12 - Cindy L: what a waste
1/27/16, 13:13 - Mom: ur imperial friend? seems she'll not rlly satisfied with her degree at imperial
1/27/16, 13:13 - Cindy L: nah i dunno
1/27/16, 13:13 - Cindy L: she's just not happy with the workload probably
1/27/16, 13:13 - Cindy L: cuz they work u like crazy
1/27/16, 13:13 - Cindy L: thats the general consensus from a number of sources
1/27/16, 13:13 - Cindy L: and its very techy
1/27/16, 13:14 - Cindy L: so a lot of drawing and making
1/27/16, 13:14 - Cindy L: and thoose guys can only do math
1/27/16, 13:14 - Cindy L: u see my point?
1/27/16, 13:14 - Cindy L: when u tell them to operate machinery
1/27/16, 13:14 - Cindy L: they're like
1/27/16, 13:14 - Cindy L: eeek
1/27/16, 13:14 - Cindy L: that's why she was saying cambridge eng is better
1/27/16, 13:15 - Cindy L: cuz basically its just math
1/27/16, 13:15 - Cindy L: and physics
1/27/16, 13:16 - Mom: that's why they go back to do research cuz they can't even work in practical situation
1/27/16, 13:17 - Cindy L: yea i guess
1/27/16, 13:17 - Cindy L: but i like making
1/27/16, 13:17 - Cindy L: :D
1/27/16, 13:17 - Cindy L: and design eng
1/27/16, 13:18 - Cindy L: is very project based
1/27/16, 13:20 - Cindy L: and no regret about econ
1/27/16, 13:20 - Cindy L: i have basically done a high school econ course
1/27/16, 13:20 - Cindy L: :)
1/27/16, 13:30 - Mom: üò¨

2/3/16, 09:52 - Cindy L: I just said I didn't wanna do auditing for life
2/3/16, 09:52 - Mom: i mean ur going to start in auditing?
2/3/16, 09:53 - Cindy L: ....
2/3/16, 09:53 - Cindy L: I just said I don't want to do auditing for the rest of life
2/3/16, 09:53 - Mom: if not, what's the point of having inside contact with pwc
2/3/16, 09:53 - Cindy L: Well these r the kind of ppl u meet as an lse std
2/3/16, 09:54 - Cindy L: Even if I hv engineering contacts that's not gonna be very helpful
2/3/16, 09:54 - Mom: fully get ur msg, but what's i meant is that ru going to start as auditor in the first place and shift to other areas later
2/3/16, 09:54 - Cindy L: No
2/3/16, 09:55 - Mom: the u have to plan ur future career carefully and determine where to stay, in uk or go to usa
2/3/16, 09:55 - Cindy L: Yea.
2/3/16, 09:55 - Cindy L: I think us transfer would be quite difficult
2/3/16, 09:56 - Cindy L: I was looking at them yesterday
2/3/16, 09:56 - Mom: everything is difficult but u still have to try
2/3/16, 09:56 - Cindy L: Unless they count my ib classes as transfer crediys
2/3/16, 09:56 - Mom: if ur not going to stay in finance field for the rest of ur life
2/3/16, 09:56 - Cindy L: Well tbh many ppl do engineering and go to finance field
2/3/16, 09:57 - Mom: ur right
2/3/16, 09:57 - Cindy L: Btw theres no stem shortage
2/3/16, 09:57 - Mom: but u have to decide which field ur going to
2/3/16, 09:57 - Mom: and determine whether u still want to stay in lse
2/3/16, 09:58 - Cindy L: Well if I'm staying in lse
2/3/16, 09:58 - Cindy L: I dunno if I should even bother changing course
2/3/16, 09:58 - Cindy L: Cuz if I do I might hv to do first yr again
2/3/16, 09:58 - Cindy L: And tbh it really doesn't matter what the fuck u do if u do a social science
2/3/16, 09:59 - Cindy L: Just a matter of if I can stand two more yrs of gov
2/3/16, 09:59 - Mom: exactly
2/3/16, 09:59 - Cindy L: Or poli sci
2/3/16, 09:59 - Cindy L: To be more specific
2/3/16, 09:59 - Cindy L: But since I hv all this free time
2/3/16, 10:00 - Cindy L: I can do my own shit
2/3/16, 10:00 - Cindy L: Like do starts up and stuff
2/3/16, 10:00 - Mom: but what i want to emphasize is ur future career plan
2/3/16, 10:00 - Mom: if ur going to go into finance field, that's fine
2/3/16, 10:00 - Mom: but if not, then u've to have another plan
2/3/16, 10:00 - Cindy L: Jesus Christ if I had any idea of my future at all I wouldn't be having this dilemma
2/3/16, 10:01 - Mom: no, ur career plan i meant
2/3/16, 10:01 - Cindy L: Yea I meant career plan
2/3/16, 10:02 - Mom: still don't know what to do?
2/3/16, 10:02 - Mom: finance? engineering? IT?
2/3/16, 10:02 - Mom: journalism?
2/3/16, 10:02 - Mom: writer?
2/3/16, 10:02 - Mom: marketing?
2/3/16, 10:02 - Cindy L: Tbh ever since I couldn't do the thing I really want to do, it doesn't really matter anymore.
2/3/16, 10:03 - Mom: what's ur rlly want thing?
2/3/16, 10:03 - Cindy L: Hahaha u know
2/3/16, 10:04 - Mom: no, ur changing quite often
2/3/16, 10:04 - Cindy L: It pretty hard to go back into the creatives anyways
2/3/16, 10:04 - Mom: why can't go to creatives?
2/3/16, 10:05 - Cindy L: Cuz bachelor and Master are going to be irrelevant?
2/3/16, 10:05 - Cindy L: Plus I have no portfolio
2/3/16, 10:05 - Cindy L: Except for digital stuff
2/3/16, 10:05 - Cindy L: To be fair, with all the time I have I could put together a portfolio here.
2/3/16, 10:06 - Mom: ok, say it again, what exactly is ur rlly want thing?
2/3/16, 10:06 - Cindy L: Lol film
2/3/16, 10:06 - Cindy L: Or tech
2/3/16, 10:07 - Cindy L: As in making stuff tech
2/3/16, 10:07 - Cindy L: But those options aren't viable anymore
2/3/16, 10:07 - Mom: that's why u've to try other univ?
2/3/16, 10:07 - Cindy L: So we push them to the side.
2/3/16, 10:07 - Cindy L: I mean those r dying industries
2/3/16, 10:08 - Mom: even tech?
2/3/16, 10:08 - Cindy L: Hv u ever seen a carpenter?
2/3/16, 10:08 - Mom: ur not saying u want to be a carpenter?
2/3/16, 10:08 - Cindy L: No
2/3/16, 10:09 - Mom: have u thought of writing an email to imperial to beg for an interview?
2/3/16, 10:09 - Cindy L: Lol no
2/3/16, 10:09 - Mom: why? if u rlly loves it
2/3/16, 10:10 - Cindy L: I think I might collapse in front of them lok
2/3/16, 10:11 - Mom: so the prob is ur health
2/3/16, 10:11 - Cindy L: My real problem right now is that my bachelor is going to be irrelevant to my master
2/3/16, 10:11 - Cindy L: If I try to go into science and technology in master
2/3/16, 10:12 - Cindy L: The best I could do is probably change to math and stats
2/3/16, 10:12 - Cindy L: Math and econ
2/3/16, 10:12 - Cindy L: Which would mean I hv to get a first and above 90%
2/3/16, 10:12 - Cindy L: Lol
2/3/16, 10:12 - Cindy L: Or I hv to repeat first year
2/3/16, 10:13 - Cindy L: If I repeat first yr is migt as well go to another uni
2/3/16, 10:13 - Cindy L: But I don't know where to go
2/3/16, 10:13 - Mom: that's why i told u to try transfer us
2/3/16, 10:13 - Cindy L: I have a list like cmu and Michigan
2/3/16, 10:14 - Cindy L: But transfer require credits and calculus courses.
2/3/16, 10:14 - Cindy L: Which annoying I do ma107 and its a retarded math course.
2/3/16, 10:14 - Cindy L: It's considered just high school math
2/3/16, 10:15 - Cindy L: Plus I'm gonna have to start again in the us, which is great.
2/3/16, 10:16 - Mom: no, u can write them an email detailing ur present studying position and asking for a transfer, if possible starting from second yr and make up some required subjects, if not possible, ur willing to start in the first yr
2/3/16, 10:16 - Cindy L: Yea sure I'll do that today
2/3/16, 10:16 - Cindy L: I need to think abt things.
2/3/16, 10:17 - Cindy L: Cuz honestly
2/3/16, 10:17 - Cindy L: I really wanted to do design work.
2/3/16, 10:17 - Mom: cuz in us, ppl choose their major only in third yr, but now u can detailing ur desire to study tech or whatever, to impress them for special consideration
2/3/16, 10:18 - Cindy L: Yea sure I hv a neuromuscular problem tada!
2/3/16, 10:18 - Mom: that's why i asked u to write imperial an email and beg for an interview
2/3/16, 10:18 - Mom: what neuromuscular prob?
2/3/16, 10:19 - Mom: collapse again?
2/3/16, 10:19 - Cindy L: Yea what neuromuscular problem?
2/3/16, 10:19 - Mom: u said : Yea sure I hv a neuromuscular problem tada!
2/3/16, 10:20 - Cindy L: Yea that is a true fact
2/3/16, 10:20 - Cindy L: My muscles don't behave normally and its because of snafus in the brain.
2/3/16, 10:21 - Mom: how not normal?
2/3/16, 10:21 - Mom: how's ur sleep prob and cataplexy?
2/3/16, 10:22 - Mom: getting worse?
2/3/16, 10:23 - Cindy L: My muscles don't behave normally because they occasionally go weak at inappropriate times.
2/3/16, 10:23 - Cindy L: I'm sure ur muscles don't behave like that.
2/3/16, 10:24 - Mom: i'm trying to understand more of ur prob to see if i can help in any case
2/3/16, 10:25 - Cindy L: Nah that's what my flatmate asked and i replies I can't even help myself
2/3/16, 10:26 - Mom: i think everybody is just trying to give some sort of help even we don't and can't fully understand the prob
2/3/16, 10:27 - Cindy L: No he's a fucking asshole, no need to feel bad for him
2/3/16, 10:27 - Mom: but i do care abt u
2/3/16, 10:28 - Cindy L: (In light of other events)
2/3/16, 10:29 - Mom: well, back to ur univ business, just try the transfer to us bc u can still pick those course relating to maths and sci at uni
2/3/16, 10:29 - Cindy L: Yea but don't need to worry that much abt it. I've already categorized it along with eczema as annoying shit I just hv.
2/3/16, 10:29 - Mom: which is helpful for a master in tech in the long run
2/3/16, 10:30 - Mom: how's ur skin now, better in uk's weather or the same as in hk
2/3/16, 10:31 - Cindy L: Well kinda disappointed but I guess that's what we'll do
2/3/16, 10:31 - Mom: disappointed abt what? eczema?
2/3/16, 10:31 - Mom: or uni prob?
2/3/16, 10:32 - Cindy L: Uni prob ofc
2/3/16, 10:32 - Cindy L: It's a bit too late to be disappointed abt eczema
2/3/16, 10:32 - Cindy L: üòë
2/3/16, 10:32 - Mom: how's ur skin now?
2/3/16, 10:32 - Cindy L: Ok
2/3/16, 10:32 - Cindy L: More manageable than hk
2/3/16, 10:33 - Mom: ok
2/3/16, 10:33 - Cindy L: Hk pollution too bad.
2/3/16, 10:33 - Cindy L: All my friends with allergies have the same problem
2/3/16, 10:33 - Mom: how's ur face colour today? still yellowish?
2/3/16, 10:33 - Cindy L: My friend can't eat shrimp in hk
2/3/16, 10:33 - Cindy L: Dunno
2/3/16, 10:33 - Cindy L: My mirror has orange light so can't tell
2/3/16, 10:34 - Mom: i saw ur photos updated on dropbox
2/3/16, 10:34 - Mom: did u put make-up?
2/3/16, 10:34 - Cindy L: Oh I was trying to take a dp
2/3/16, 10:34 - Mom: cuz ur face looks so white
2/3/16, 10:34 - Cindy L: No
2/3/16, 10:34 - Cindy L: It's the lighting
2/3/16, 10:34 - Mom: what's dp?
2/3/16, 10:34 - Cindy L: Photographers trick
2/3/16, 10:34 - Cindy L: Display photo
2/3/16, 10:35 - Cindy L: For fb cuz I have no photo and ppl complain abt it
2/3/16, 10:35 - Mom: why bother other ppl's complaint?
2/3/16, 10:35 - Cindy L: Because I want a dp too
2/3/16, 10:35 - Mom: just post some other photo
2/3/16, 10:35 - Mom: ok
2/3/16, 10:36 - Mom: if u don't think of imperial again, did u think abt transfering to ucl's engineering?
2/3/16, 10:37 - Mom: u just tell them that u've no interest in social sci at all but just to meet family's request in the first place
2/3/16, 10:38 - Cindy L: Hmm that's not a bad idea but I can't transfer
2/3/16, 10:39 - Cindy L: And there's no similar course to design engineering
2/3/16, 10:39 - Cindy L: üòî
2/3/16, 10:39 - Cindy L: Maybe I should hv done archi
2/3/16, 10:39 - Cindy L: Remember Matthew ho?
2/3/16, 10:39 - Mom: of u can't but u can tell them that ur now in lse and want to do an engineering deg and ask for a special consideration
2/3/16, 10:39 - Mom: where to do archi?
2/3/16, 10:40 - Cindy L: Lol special consideration
2/3/16, 10:40 - Cindy L: U know u can't skip first year if u didn't do the first year courses
2/3/16, 10:41 - Cindy L: I know a girl who did econ and econ history
2/3/16, 10:41 - Mom: u have to do the first yr ofc, but do the application in special way
2/3/16, 10:41 - Cindy L: And then she changed to econ WITH econ history and they still made her redo first yr
2/3/16, 10:42 - Mom: that's why i told u to write them an email telling them ur current situation and ask for a special consideration for transfer, but u still hv to do the first yr course ofc
2/3/16, 10:42 - Cindy L: Ah u see that's the thing, I don't really want to do first yr again.
2/3/16, 10:42 - Cindy L: Since uni doesn't even matter.
2/3/16, 10:42 - Cindy L: That's what all the working ppl say.
2/3/16, 10:43 - Mom: but the prob is u hv to change major in the second and third yr to make subj relevant for ur master deg
2/3/16, 10:43 - Cindy L: Yea I know.
2/3/16, 10:43 - Cindy L: That's why I'm considering whether to change to math and econ
2/3/16, 10:43 - Cindy L: But I didnt do the first yr math courses which means I'm gonna hv to start again.
2/3/16, 10:44 - Mom: to change to maths and econ, u still hv to redo first yr right
2/3/16, 10:44 - Cindy L: Yea, most likrly
2/3/16, 10:44 - Cindy L: Unless I get a first I heard
2/3/16, 10:44 - Mom: so, if ur going to redo a first yr, why don't go straight to another sci/tech major uni
2/3/16, 10:45 - Cindy L: Yea so that means UK is out of question.
2/3/16, 10:45 - Cindy L: Us is not guaranteed a transfer
2/3/16, 10:45 - Cindy L: So I may hv to apply again
2/3/16, 10:45 - Cindy L: And that will be four yrs
2/3/16, 10:45 - Mom: u just have to try
2/3/16, 10:45 - Cindy L: So I thought abt all that time
2/3/16, 10:46 - Cindy L: And I thought I could do a lot of stuff in that time too if not for study
2/3/16, 10:46 - Cindy L: And so now we should be on the same page.
2/3/16, 10:47 - Mom: ur not re-applying to us uni as a first yr student, ur asking for a transfer to us uni
2/3/16, 10:48 - Cindy L: What if they say no, then its reapply again.
2/3/16, 10:48 - Cindy L: But whatever I'll ask them today later
2/3/16, 10:49 - Mom: u don't have to bother the name of "applying" or 'transfering", just try asking to see if they allow ur request
2/3/16, 10:49 - Mom: if u say ur applying, i think u've already missed their deadline
2/3/16, 10:49 - Cindy L: No my point is that transfer is three years and applying is four years
2/3/16, 10:50 - Mom: i know, but in us, the pace of ur study depends on urself
2/3/16, 10:50 - Cindy L: No its not
2/3/16, 10:50 - Cindy L: U still get a timetable
2/3/16, 10:50 - Cindy L: It's similar to now
2/3/16, 10:50 - Mom: if u study hard, u can finish ur deg in three yr or less
2/3/16, 10:50 - Mom: no
2/3/16, 10:51 - Mom: u can go for more credit points in the term year
2/3/16, 10:51 - Cindy L: Yes my friends r doing that as we speak.
2/3/16, 10:51 - Cindy L: Sure but do u think I am superman?
2/3/16, 10:51 - Mom: i've friends studying in the us b4, they told me as i understood
2/3/16, 10:52 - Cindy L: Ur friends are from like decades ago
2/3/16, 10:52 - Cindy L: Things change
2/3/16, 10:52 - Mom: even if u still hv to take 4 yrs, why bother this extra yr?
2/3/16, 10:52 - Mom: u still have many more in the long run
2/3/16, 10:52 - Cindy L: I bother because I've had enough of studying.
2/3/16, 10:52 - Mom: but if u just stuck in ur present situation, u'll be unhappy for the rest of ur life
2/3/16, 10:53 - Mom: going to uni is better than doing jobs in the real world
2/3/16, 10:53 - Cindy L: Hmm I dunno I'm not that unhappy
2/3/16, 10:54 - Mom: bc ur not in the job market
2/3/16, 10:55 - Mom: at uni, u still can choose whether skip ur lessons or not, but in the job market, that's not possible
2/3/16, 10:55 - Cindy L: I guess
2/3/16, 10:55 - Mom: even if ur assigned an "unwanted" task
2/3/16, 10:55 - Cindy L: Well I know that I'm definitely not working in government
2/3/16, 10:55 - Cindy L: It's so bad
2/3/16, 10:56 - Mom: that's the same in all industry, not just in gov't
2/3/16, 10:56 - Cindy L: It's truly the study of institution and bureaucracy
2/3/16, 10:56 - Mom: but in gov't, it's much better as ur job is protected
2/3/16, 10:56 - Mom: but in private sector, it's not
2/3/16, 10:57 - Cindy L: Sure I bet its better than the state of nature
2/3/16, 10:57 - Cindy L: As u can tell I'm not a stability person.
2/3/16, 10:57 - Mom: that's why everybody wants to go into gov't job
2/3/16, 10:58 - Cindy L: Sure
2/3/16, 10:58 - Mom: yea, that's why u hv to think abt ur career every carefully
2/3/16, 10:58 - Cindy L: Not government I already know
2/3/16, 10:58 - Mom: ofc, i know
2/3/16, 10:58 - Cindy L: Finance is just excel work
2/3/16, 10:58 - Cindy L: Lol
2/3/16, 10:59 - Cindy L: Making spreadsheets and stuff
2/3/16, 10:59 - Mom: actually, finance is networking job
2/3/16, 10:59 - Mom: no
2/3/16, 10:59 - Cindy L: I figured that the fancy word for spreadsheet making is modelling
2/3/16, 10:59 - Mom: u got to find ur own client in the long run
2/3/16, 10:59 - Cindy L: Sure how's that different from if I did startups
2/3/16, 11:00 - Mom: then what abt the fancy word for ir?
2/3/16, 11:00 - Cindy L: I might as well do a media startup
2/3/16, 11:00 - Cindy L: Or like do an app company
2/3/16, 11:00 - Mom: then think abt going to us univ
2/3/16, 11:00 - Mom: uk is not a place for that
2/3/16, 11:00 - Cindy L: No actually startup pretty good here
2/3/16, 11:01 - Mom: rlly?
2/3/16, 11:01 - Cindy L: Lots of conventions and funding and competitions
2/3/16, 11:01 - Mom: did u google the stem jobs in uk market?
2/3/16, 11:01 - Cindy L: There's no lack of stem
2/3/16, 11:01 - Cindy L: There's only lack of female stem
2/3/16, 11:02 - Cindy L: Which is not significant
2/3/16, 11:02 - Cindy L: I literally asked every single engineering person I met
2/3/16, 11:02 - Mom: then try other unis in uk, like ucl/bristol/bath?
2/3/16, 11:02 - Cindy L: Urgh
2/3/16, 11:02 - Cindy L: I'm not going out of london
2/3/16, 11:02 - Cindy L: I'm not gonna survive
2/3/16, 11:03 - Mom: ucl
2/3/16, 11:03 - Cindy L: Bath requires art
2/3/16, 11:03 - Cindy L: What for engineering?
2/3/16, 11:03 - Mom: yea
2/3/16, 11:03 - Cindy L: U know why chemical engineer earn so much?
2/3/16, 11:03 - Mom: mechanical engineering or product design?
2/3/16, 11:03 - Mom: why?
2/3/16, 11:04 - Cindy L: Cuz they're essentially process engineers
2/3/16, 11:04 - Mom: but u didn't do chem in ib?
2/3/16, 11:04 - Cindy L: They hv a lot of options.
2/3/16, 11:04 - Cindy L: So essentially they r managers with engineering knowledge
2/3/16, 11:04 - Cindy L: The world is a fucked up place.
2/3/16, 11:04 - Cindy L: Hahahha
2/3/16, 11:05 - Cindy L: Mech eng earn the least cuz the car industry in Britain is dying.
2/3/16, 11:05 - Mom: it's ur own decision, u picked film studies instead of chem, don't blame
2/3/16, 11:05 - Mom: just treat this as a lesson
2/3/16, 11:06 - Cindy L: I'm not saying I want to be a chem engineer
2/3/16, 11:06 - Cindy L: U don't get it.
2/3/16, 11:06 - Cindy L: I'm saying why is management making so much
2/3/16, 11:07 - Cindy L: So at that point in the conersation
2/3/16, 11:07 - Mom: that's why everybody wants to do mgt job
2/3/16, 11:07 - Cindy L: OK finally understood why dad is a systems engineer
2/3/16, 11:07 - Mom: he's not a system engr, he's just an electrical engineer
2/3/16, 11:08 - Cindy L: But his title is a systems engineer, no?
2/3/16, 11:08 - Mom: senior project manager
2/3/16, 11:08 - Cindy L: It's doesn't matter what u arr
2/3/16, 11:08 - Cindy L: It's what ur title ism
2/3/16, 11:08 - Mom: his boss wants him to do system design work, but he's reluctant to do that
2/3/16, 11:08 - Cindy L: I thought he was systems engineer for a while.
2/3/16, 11:09 - Mom: cuz he said he's not well-versed with it
2/3/16, 11:09 - Cindy L: ...

2/3/16, 11:11 - Mom: i think u like those kind of work rather than soci sci
2/3/16, 11:11 - Cindy L: I might as well beg them to take me into neuroscience as a specimen.
2/3/16, 11:11 - Mom: no way
2/3/16, 11:11 - Mom: there're lots of weird cases in uk

2/3/16, 11:14 - Cindy L: Now I hv no skills
2/3/16, 11:15 - Mom: i just want u to be a normal person
2/3/16, 11:15 - Cindy L: Except for doing whole research papers two days before deadline.
2/3/16, 11:15 - Mom: wow, u did that in 2 days only
2/3/16, 11:15 - Cindy L: Yah
2/3/16, 11:16 - Cindy L: I had to do my own research and shit.
2/3/16, 11:16 - Mom: so what u do in the othe days?
2/3/16, 11:16 - Mom: other
2/3/16, 11:16 - Cindy L: Look at neurotransmitters
2/3/16, 11:16 - Cindy L: Did u know slow waves play a role in consolidating long term memory?
2/3/16, 11:17 - Cindy L: So lack of sws should mean that my long term memory is gettign worse.
2/3/16, 11:17 - Mom: ur long term memory is getting worse now?
2/3/16, 11:18 - Cindy L: I'm not sure for myself, cuz I just really don't care enough abt the things around me right now.
2/3/16, 11:18 - Cindy L: It's like how when I look at people, I tend to look through them or not look at them.
2/3/16, 11:19 - Mom: what does that mean?
2/3/16, 11:19 - Cindy L: I think that's why people say I look stoned/ tired/ bored all the time.
2/3/16, 11:19 - Cindy L: It's like I'm look past u instead of at u
2/3/16, 11:19 - Cindy L: I always do that
2/3/16, 11:20 - Mom: u meant u've no eye contact with ppl?
2/3/16, 11:20 - Cindy L: Yea or that
2/3/16, 11:21 - Mom: did u intentionally do that or u just do it naturally?
2/3/16, 11:21 - Cindy L: Habit I guess
2/3/16, 11:21 - Cindy L: Nobody says anything interesting anyways
2/3/16, 11:21 - Mom: no eye contact can be intepreted as no confidence
2/3/16, 11:21 - Cindy L: KGV ppl were already pretty interesting.
2/3/16, 11:22 - Cindy L: I don't hv lack of confidence
2/3/16, 11:22 - Cindy L: I have a lack of milk
2/3/16, 11:22 - Mom: that means ur not interested in those ppl right
2/3/16, 11:23 - Mom: what lack of milk?
2/3/16, 11:23 - Cindy L: Yea I guess.
2/3/16, 11:23 - Cindy L: They talk abt like travelling and eating and music
2/3/16, 11:23 - Cindy L: It's like watching TV
2/3/16, 11:23 - Cindy L: It's boring shit
2/3/16, 11:24 - Cindy L: Once in a while I wanna watch breaking bad
2/3/16, 11:24 - Cindy L: Lol I ruin conversations.
2/3/16, 11:27 - Mom: this is the reality, ppl won't share closed things in public conversation
2/3/16, 11:28 - Cindy L: My friend's dog passed away, so sad.
2/3/16, 11:28 - Cindy L: Not really
2/3/16, 11:28 - Cindy L: I find some people r pretty open.
2/3/16, 11:29 - Cindy L: They answer whatever u ask them, lol
2/3/16, 11:29 - Cindy L: British people and white ppl tend to be conservative that's for sure.
2/3/16, 11:30 - Cindy L: Though tbh I haven't even met many of them, they just stick together and giggle in a group
2/3/16, 11:33 - Cindy L: Omg I hv to say, its so good to hv senpais though

2/3/16, 11:36 - Cindy L: It's not good to be african though
2/3/16, 11:36 - Cindy L: Their countries r so corrupt u can even imagine.
2/3/16, 11:37 - Cindy L: China in comparison is a great place
2/3/16, 11:37 - Cindy L: If u were african that is
2/3/16, 11:38 - Mom: so be grateful ur hongkonger right
2/3/16, 11:38 - Mom: and u can go everywhere

2/3/16, 11:51 - Cindy L: Esp in the vr field.
2/3/16, 11:51 - Mom: ur not even a media person
2/3/16, 11:51 - Cindy L: Media meaning production of the sort of material
2/3/16, 11:52 - Cindy L: Not like media media
2/3/16, 11:52 - Cindy L: Like the sun or the daily mirror that load of crap
2/3/16, 11:52 - Cindy L: So many Indians in startup business thoufh
2/3/16, 11:54 - Mom: those production guys r usually the most insecure person as they can't even have confidence if their works wud be accepted by the public, if not, they won't have funds for further jobs
2/3/16, 11:54 - Mom: so the point is u want to start ur business right?
2/3/16, 11:55 - Cindy L: Well if I stay here. That's probably what I'm gonna do.
2/3/16, 11:55 - Mom: where else u want to go? hong kong? china? japan?
2/3/16, 11:55 - Cindy L: Go into venture capitals lol
2/3/16, 11:56 - Mom: u must have rlly gd idea for the venture capital to invest in ur business
2/3/16, 11:56 - Cindy L: No I meant go into those companies that invest in start ups.
2/3/16, 11:57 - Cindy L: And it's timing
2/3/16, 11:57 - Cindy L: Not idea

2/3/16, 11:57 - Cindy L: Lol
2/3/16, 11:57 - Cindy L: I mean finance is not too bad
2/3/16, 11:58 - Cindy L: I think it's more interesting inside industry and u get to talk to smarter ppl
2/3/16, 11:58 - Mom: u know the financial market is crashing these days
2/3/16, 11:58 - Cindy L: Yea but it goes up and down.
2/3/16, 11:58 - Cindy L: And u can short
2/3/16, 11:58 - Cindy L: Hahahahaha üòÇ
2/3/16, 11:59 - Mom: finance has lots of smart ppl, but they're usually not warm-hearted
2/3/16, 11:59 - Cindy L: And then go bankrupt, not so funny then
2/3/16, 11:59 - Mom: engineering used to have just ordinary ppl
2/3/16, 11:59 - Cindy L: Dude but neither r IR or gov ppl
2/3/16, 11:59 - Cindy L: Those r the worst
2/3/16, 11:59 - Cindy L: They think they read a few books and know everything abt the world
2/3/16, 12:00 - Mom: cuz those ppl want to change the world
2/3/16, 12:00 - Cindy L: Or u hv the ones who r literally a waste of space on the planet, and the only use I can think of for them is to use as biofuel
2/3/16, 12:01 - Cindy L: Lol lol lol change the world?
2/3/16, 12:01 - Cindy L: How bout step outside of ur little ethnic circle first?
2/3/16, 12:01 - Mom: i think most ppl in ir/politics wants to change the world
2/3/16, 12:02 - Cindy L: Yea to be famous and powerful
2/3/16, 12:02 - Cindy L: More like
2/3/16, 12:02 - Mom: if not, why bother to pick a non-secure course in uni
2/3/16, 12:03 - Cindy L: Cuz interest
2/3/16, 12:03 - Cindy L: What that should be the number one reason u choose a course
2/3/16, 12:03 - Cindy L: I'm not joking.
2/3/16, 12:04 - Cindy L: Cuz it doesn't matter what u study in school anyways.
2/3/16, 12:04 - Mom: interest is just for teens, not for someone in the job market
2/3/16, 12:04 - Cindy L: U don't need to go to the lse if u want to study
2/3/16, 12:04 - Cindy L: Just go borrow a book
2/3/16, 12:04 - Cindy L: U go to lse to meet the people.
2/3/16, 12:05 - Mom: a well-known deg is a shield for u to go into the job market
2/3/16, 12:05 - Cindy L: No man, as long as lse u're fine
2/3/16, 12:05 - Mom: it's just like a mom circle, u belong to that circle
2/3/16, 12:05 - Cindy L: Hahahaha
2/3/16, 12:05 - Cindy L: Yes
2/3/16, 12:05 - Cindy L: The lse circle
2/3/16, 12:06 - Cindy L: Yea belonging to a circle is great!
2/3/16, 12:06 - Mom: it's true, if ur not from particular circle, u won't get along well with ur colleage in office
2/3/16, 12:06 - Mom: even in ur industry
2/3/16, 12:06 - Cindy L: Yea see
2/3/16, 12:06 - Cindy L: Unless ur super charismatic
2/3/16, 12:06 - Mom: that's why ppl go to no.1 uni
2/3/16, 12:07 - Cindy L: Then I'd be a linker
2/3/16, 12:07 - Cindy L: Then u would be a linker
2/3/16, 12:07 - Cindy L: Companies assume u're a total noob and they have to teach u everything from the beginning again.
2/3/16, 12:07 - Mom: ppl just want to be part of that particular circle so that they can derive benefit from it
2/3/16, 12:08 - Cindy L: So they don't care abt what u study
2/3/16, 12:08 - Cindy L: Which is why
2/3/16, 12:08 - Mom: exactly
2/3/16, 12:08 - Cindy L: I've been wondering
2/3/16, 12:08 - Mom: they care abt ur uni
2/3/16, 12:08 - Cindy L: Is it worth switching out of gov
2/3/16, 12:08 - Mom: so even if u can start ur own studying, u won't have that particular link
2/3/16, 12:08 - Cindy L: I think they got rid of electives for next yr though
2/3/16, 12:09 - Cindy L: What do you mean?
2/3/16, 12:09 - Mom: cuz ur not in a circle
2/3/16, 12:10 - Cindy L: Me? Yea I am
2/3/16, 12:10 - Cindy L: Im in the international peeps circle
2/3/16, 12:10 - Cindy L: The KGV circle
2/3/16, 12:10 - Mom: the Q abt whether to transfer to maths and econ is that is it helpful for u to apply a master in sci and tech, if not, then u'll have to think again
2/3/16, 12:10 - Cindy L: Yea
2/3/16, 12:11 - Cindy L: I think that's really the point
2/3/16, 12:11 - Mom: i mean if u don't go to well-known uni, ur not in the mom circle like me
2/3/16, 12:11 - Cindy L: Why aren't u in the mom circle
2/3/16, 12:11 - Cindy L: Cuz u didn't live in shatin.
2/3/16, 12:11 - Cindy L: It was more of a shatin thing.
2/3/16, 12:12 - Mom: i went to the 2nd tier uni, whereas in the job market, ppl just hire student from own uni
2/3/16, 12:12 - Cindy L: No I meant the mom circle
2/3/16, 12:12 - Cindy L: U can't be a second tier mom lol
2/3/16, 12:13 - Mom: bc i'm not a bossy mom
2/3/16, 12:13 - Cindy L: U don't need to be, just need to show up
2/3/16, 12:13 - Cindy L: Then u become a regular
2/3/16, 12:14 - Cindy L: And then talk to the main people more often.
2/3/16, 12:14 - Cindy L: Then they remember ur face
2/3/16, 12:14 - Cindy L: And then after a while
2/3/16, 12:14 - Mom: other than show up, u have to contribute something like common habits, conversation
2/3/16, 12:14 - Cindy L: U're guaranteed a spot on the next committee
2/3/16, 12:14 - Cindy L: Not really
2/3/16, 12:14 - Cindy L: Just ask a lot of questions
2/3/16, 12:15 - Cindy L: Show ur interested
2/3/16, 12:15 - Cindy L: Rmb names without asking.
2/3/16, 12:15 - Mom: then u'll get annoyed face
2/3/16, 12:15 - Cindy L: Dude networking is like playing sims 4
2/3/16, 12:16 - Cindy L: Ppl like to talk abt themselves
2/3/16, 12:16 - Mom: ppl used to worship great person, smart person or rich guys
2/3/16, 12:16 - Cindy L: There's this video on YouTube lol its really funny
2/3/16, 12:16 - Mom: if u qualified for one of them, then they respect u
2/3/16, 12:16 - Cindy L: It's abt people just waiting to talk abt themselves all the time.
2/3/16, 12:16 - Cindy L: That's the HK circle for you
2/3/16, 12:17 - Cindy L: Too annoying if respect is involved
2/3/16, 12:17 - Cindy L: That's why I'm not in any HK societies
2/3/16, 12:17 - Cindy L: They hv under the table rankings
2/3/16, 12:17 - Mom: but that's hk ppl u can't avoid if u want to make friends with them or be part in the mom circle
2/3/16, 12:18 - Cindy L: Fine I see ur point
2/3/16, 12:18 - Cindy L: That's true
2/3/16, 12:18 - Mom: exactly under the table ranking
2/3/16, 12:18 - Cindy L: Hk ppl r annoying as fuck
2/3/16, 12:18 - Cindy L: Or I guess most Asian groups are like that
2/3/16, 12:18 - Mom: that's why u know i don't belong to any mom circle now
2/3/16, 12:18 - Cindy L: It's like how I don't do hkpass
2/3/16, 12:19 - Mom: no comment on other asian but chinese r like that
2/3/16, 12:19 - Cindy L: Or chisoc
2/3/16, 12:19 - Cindy L: Oh trust me
2/3/16, 12:19 - Cindy L: Koreans are exactly the same
2/3/16, 12:19 - Cindy L: Same with japanese
2/3/16, 12:19 - Cindy L: And mainlander
2/3/16, 12:19 - Cindy L: And taiwanese
2/3/16, 12:19 - Cindy L: And Singaporean
2/3/16, 12:20 - Cindy L: Most people r close minded, exclusive fucktards
2/3/16, 12:20 - Mom: Â∞èËæ≤Âü∫Âõ†
2/3/16, 12:20 - Cindy L: No I don't think so
2/3/16, 12:20 - Cindy L: Cuz white people r exactly the same
2/3/16, 12:21 - Cindy L: Dude even language is a barrier
2/3/16, 12:21 - Cindy L: How do u expect people to overlook skin colour
2/3/16, 12:21 - Cindy L: Not to mention class
2/3/16, 12:21 - Cindy L: Or illness
2/3/16, 12:21 - Mom: so, we're the weird ppl in the world?
2/3/16, 12:21 - Cindy L: Lol mental illness
2/3/16, 12:22 - Cindy L: Yea we're minority
2/3/16, 12:22 - Cindy L: If lse is a microcosm of the world
2/3/16, 12:22 - Cindy L: We r the 1&
2/3/16, 12:22 - Cindy L: 1%
2/3/16, 12:22 - Mom: that's why ur not happy in lse?
2/3/16, 12:23 - Cindy L: Duh exactly
2/3/16, 12:23 - Mom: so where to go?
2/3/16, 12:24 - Cindy L: U meet people who barely have two brain cells to rub together and they think they know everything abt the world.
2/3/16, 12:24 - Cindy L: And then making friends is like playing sims 4 and trying to blend as well into the circle as possible u might as well be a chameleon
2/3/16, 12:25 - Cindy L: Lol I'm impressed they hv a unit on china though
2/3/16, 12:25 - Cindy L: It's like globalization is irrelevant to them.
2/3/16, 12:25 - Cindy L: Hahahaha
2/3/16, 12:26 - Mom: maybe globalization is done in ir course
2/3/16, 12:27 - Cindy L: Not it depends on the lecturer
2/3/16, 12:27 - Cindy L: We now hv a Chinese lady for macroecon
2/3/16, 12:27 - Mom: what? unbelievable
2/3/16, 12:27 - Mom: not on the course structure?
2/3/16, 12:27 - Cindy L: No
2/3/16, 12:28 - Cindy L: Because essentially
2/3/16, 12:28 - Cindy L: U are forced to study what they research
2/3/16, 12:28 - Cindy L: The readings r most of the time published by lse
2/3/16, 12:29 - Cindy L: I literally had to gather my own research cuz the readings were useless for my essay question
2/3/16, 12:29 - Mom: where the lecturers from?
2/3/16, 12:29 - Cindy L: All aroudn the world
2/3/16, 12:29 - Cindy L: Really depends

2/3/16, 12:33 - Cindy L: Beg imperial on what basis?
2/3/16, 12:34 - Cindy L: Why the fuck did they reject me anyways
2/3/16, 12:34 - Mom: no basis, just show u genuine interest
2/3/16, 12:34 - Cindy L: That's not enough
2/3/16, 12:34 - Cindy L: U know its like 9 to 1 place
2/3/16, 12:35 - Cindy L: U need a bargaining chip
2/3/16, 12:35 - Cindy L: And tbh I am not the most hardworking person
2/3/16, 12:35 - Mom: i know but i don't think everyone applying this course rlly want to be in the design field
2/3/16, 12:35 - Mom: ur not bargaining with them, just beg for another chance
2/3/16, 12:36 - Mom: maybe u can ask for a reason why ur not shorlist and ask if they can provide any suggestions so that u can apply the course next year
2/3/16, 12:37 - Cindy L: Hmm I'm actually thinking of another way I can get into a design course
2/3/16, 12:37 - Mom: to just show ur genuine desire to be a design engineer
2/3/16, 12:37 - Mom: yea, go ahead
2/3/16, 12:38 - Mom: do something relevant to convince ppl
2/3/16, 12:38 - Cindy L: Cuz I worry I can't cope with imperial workload
2/3/16, 12:38 - Cindy L: And I want to do my own stuff
2/3/16, 12:38 - Mom: not just stay in the present position and depressed

2/3/16, 14:17 - Cindy L: It's not like I can control it.
2/3/16, 14:18 - Mom: hey, how abt taking part-time course in neuro science bc u said u've plenty of time other than regular course  at lse
2/3/16, 14:18 - Mom: so that u might thought of a doing a master deg in neuro sci
2/3/16, 14:19 - Cindy L: Can I?
2/3/16, 14:19 - Cindy L: Cuz tbh I got loadsa time to spare
2/3/16, 14:19 - Cindy L: I thought I might try to get a part time job though
2/3/16, 14:32 - Mom: if ur going to stay in lse for another 2 yrs, i wud suggest u take other course relating to neuro sci or anything else relevant to the master deg ur going to do in the future
2/3/16, 14:33 - Mom: partime job won't help alot with ur finance/future work experience i think
2/3/16, 14:36 - Cindy L: Yea I just wanna do one for fun
2/3/16, 14:36 - Cindy L: I saw this one for a jewelry shop and u do soldering and deliveries.
2/3/16, 14:37 - Mom: don't do shitty job which doesn't help with ur future career
2/3/16, 14:37 - Mom: it's a waste of time and energy
2/3/16, 14:37 - Cindy L: Really?
2/3/16, 14:37 - Cindy L: OK then.
2/3/16, 14:38 - Cindy L: Though regarding internship
2/3/16, 14:38 - Mom: ur future employer won't count anything irrelevant in ur work history
2/3/16, 14:38 - Cindy L: Seems like my acturial friends all found one pretty easily.
2/3/16, 14:39 - Cindy L: Everyone else, none
2/3/16, 14:39 - Mom: don't go into acturies cuz that is sooooooo boring, which u can't stand i swear
2/3/16, 14:39 - Cindy L: Spring weeks are the most difficult I swesr
2/3/16, 14:39 - Cindy L: Yea duh
2/3/16, 14:39 - Cindy L: I mean if I go into finance
2/3/16, 14:39 - Cindy L: It would be
2/3/16, 14:39 - Cindy L: Trading
2/3/16, 14:39 - Cindy L: Or fintech
2/3/16, 14:40 - Cindy L: Cuz I can use excel üòÄ
2/3/16, 14:40 - Mom: u got to have a tech deg to do fintech
2/3/16, 14:40 - Cindy L: No
2/3/16, 14:40 - Cindy L: U need math
2/3/16, 14:40 - Cindy L: Know a few languages
2/3/16, 14:40 - Mom: then ur not doing the tech thingy
2/3/16, 14:40 - Cindy L: U can learn to program on the side.
2/3/16, 14:40 - Cindy L: It's not that harf
2/3/16, 14:41 - Mom: but u still need a proper deg to convince ur future employer, not just telling them that u can do it
2/3/16, 14:41 - Cindy L: Plus there's so many languages
2/3/16, 14:41 - Cindy L: Fintechs are startups.
2/3/16, 14:42 - Cindy L: There's no one big fintech company yet
2/3/16, 14:42 - Mom: still, u've to provide evidence to convince ur employer
2/3/16, 14:42 - Cindy L: Sure sure my employer is probably gonna be a recent uni grad too.
2/3/16, 14:44 - Cindy L: Mocha is shit
2/3/16, 14:45 - Cindy L: My phone is also shit.
2/3/16, 14:49 - Mom: what happen to ur phone, get a new one
2/3/16, 14:50 - Cindy L: No the programs are becoming bigger
2/3/16, 14:50 - Cindy L: And my software can't keep up
2/3/16, 14:50 - Cindy L: So lags
2/3/16, 14:50 - Cindy L: Before u tell me to upgrade
2/3/16, 14:50 - Cindy L: I cant
2/3/16, 14:50 - Cindy L: Cuz lollipop is not for free
2/3/16, 14:51 - Mom: can ur phone use lollipop?
2/3/16, 14:51 - Cindy L: Not sure
2/3/16, 14:51 - Cindy L: Probably not
2/3/16, 14:52 - Cindy L: Cuz Samsung has reached s6 already
2/3/16, 14:52 - Mom: then it doesn't matter whether it's free or not
2/3/16, 14:52 - Mom: that's why ppl hv to change new phone frequently
2/3/16, 14:53 - Cindy L: Yea tru dat
2/3/16, 14:53 - Cindy L: But I wanna get the nexus

2/3/16, 14:54 - Cindy L: No
2/3/16, 14:54 - Cindy L: I'm start up maverick
2/3/16, 14:55 - Cindy L: No a corporate slave
2/3/16, 14:55 - Cindy L: Andriod was developed from an open source os
2/3/16, 14:55 - Cindy L: When u use a phone, u use their version of andriod.
2/3/16, 14:56 - Cindy L: I.e. if u use a Samsung phone, u use their version of andriod
2/3/16, 14:56 - Mom: but working experience in big corporation is good for the beginning
2/3/16, 14:56 - Cindy L: Google runs andriod the most smoothly cuz Google was the initial dev
2/3/16, 14:57 - Cindy L: Hence nexus phones runs andriod most smoothly
2/3/16, 14:57 - Mom: but still there's different version right
2/3/16, 14:57 - Mom: and ur phone's hardware must be compatible with new version
2/3/16, 15:01 - Cindy L: Yes
2/3/16, 15:01 - Cindy L: The motherboard
2/3/16, 15:03 - Mom: u know china is implementing the exchance control now
2/3/16, 15:03 - Mom: exchange
2/3/16, 15:05 - Cindy L: yay
2/3/16, 15:06 - Cindy L: i though it was always implementing trade control.
2/3/16, 15:06 - Mom: no they're trying to control money flowing out of china
2/3/16, 15:06 - Mom: now
2/3/16, 15:07 - Cindy L: ok
2/3/16, 15:07 - Mom: as ppl sense an economic crisis in china, they're trying to send their money out b4 china implement exchange control
2/3/16, 15:08 - Mom: and that's why the hk stock market going down alot these days
2/3/16, 15:08 - Cindy L: tbh hk market is always going down
2/3/16, 15:09 - Mom: hahaha
2/3/16, 15:10 - Cindy L: btw i need to discuss the seizures
2/3/16, 15:15 - Mom: ok
2/3/16, 15:15 - Mom: alot?
2/3/16, 15:16 - Cindy L: no
2/3/16, 15:16 - Cindy L: i made new observations
2/3/16, 15:16 - Cindy L: i started feeling contractions (tonic) in my fingers.
2/3/16, 15:17 - Cindy L: so it starts off clonic
2/3/16, 15:17 - Cindy L: in the fingers and hand
2/3/16, 15:17 - Mom: no such contractions b4?
2/3/16, 15:17 - Cindy L: no
2/3/16, 15:17 - Cindy L: and then if i don't use my hands and arms
2/3/16, 15:18 - Cindy L: usually they just become paralysed (atonic) so at my sides
2/3/16, 15:18 - Cindy L: then it shifts up to clonic in the facial muscles and jaw
2/3/16, 15:18 - Cindy L: that is if the seizure is not expressed in the hands
2/3/16, 15:18 - Cindy L: and arms
2/3/16, 15:19 - Cindy L: yesterday i felt slight painful muscle contracts in my  fingers on the right
2/3/16, 15:19 - Cindy L: tonic seizures
2/3/16, 15:19 - Cindy L: essentially
2/3/16, 15:20 - Cindy L: i also start hallucinating about 5 mins in
2/3/16, 15:20 - Cindy L: into the episode
2/3/16, 15:20 - Cindy L: and these are hypnagogi=vc
2/3/16, 15:21 - Cindy L: i always hear a male voice in ear, or think that there's someone next to or behind me
2/3/16, 15:21 - Cindy L: don't know why.
2/3/16, 15:22 - Cindy L: i am a 100%  sure that i got hhalufntaions
2/3/16, 15:22 - Mom: always the same man?
2/3/16, 15:22 - Cindy L: no
2/3/16, 15:22 - Cindy L: just someone
2/3/16, 15:22 - Mom: u feel someone, not seeing someone?
2/3/16, 15:23 - Cindy L: i.e. if i'm sitting in my chair, i think and feel that my chair's being tipped over.
2/3/16, 15:23 - Cindy L: its that feeling when u can heard them being around and feel them doing things arond you
2/3/16, 15:24 - Mom: and u get the feeling that ur overtuned then?
2/3/16, 15:24 - Cindy L: no
2/3/16, 15:24 - Mom: them?
2/3/16, 15:24 - Cindy L: i need  to listen to music to sleep
2/3/16, 15:24 - Mom: does that help?
2/3/16, 15:35 - Mom: does ur seizure last for long time?
2/3/16, 15:44 - Mom: how often do u have that kind of hallucination? every night? or on occasion only?
2/3/16, 15:45 - Cindy L: everytime i have seizure
2/3/16, 15:45 - Cindy L: about 5 mins in i start getting them
2/3/16, 15:45 - Cindy L: the whole thing from clonus in the hands last approx 15 mins
2/3/16, 15:46 - Mom: then go into sleep afterwards?
2/3/16, 15:46 - Cindy L: no
2/3/16, 15:46 - Cindy L: now i just return to normal awake state
2/3/16, 15:47 - Mom: u just hv seizure?
2/3/16, 15:47 - Cindy L: yep
2/3/16, 15:47 - Cindy L: and hallucination
2/3/16, 15:47 - Cindy L: i sort of lose my mind during hallucination
2/3/16, 15:47 - Mom: so frequent
2/3/16, 15:48 - Mom: yesterday and then today
2/3/16, 15:48 - Cindy L: i'm just worried about getting grand mals
2/3/16, 15:48 - Cindy L: cuz those are scary as fuck
2/3/16, 15:48 - Mom: what do u mean by lose ur mind?
2/3/16, 15:49 - Cindy L: like i'm totally lost to the hallucinations - i can't move and i think theres a weird guy trying to push me over
2/3/16, 15:49 - Cindy L: and then i close my eyes and i see geometric shapes grow big and small
2/3/16, 15:49 - Mom: r ur eyes open during hallucinations?
2/3/16, 15:50 - Cindy L: probably not
2/3/16, 15:50 - Cindy L: i don't know
2/3/16, 15:50 - Cindy L: ah wait i do
2/3/16, 15:50 - Cindy L: i probaby close them during face and jaw clonus
2/3/16, 15:50 - Mom: but u said u close ur eyes and see geometric shapes?
2/3/16, 15:50 - Cindy L: ok
2/3/16, 15:51 - Cindy L: not close my eyes in the typical sense
2/3/16, 15:51 - Cindy L: but like
2/3/16, 15:51 - Cindy L: don't see reality anymore
2/3/16, 15:51 - Mom: but u can control ur eyes opening and closing?
2/3/16, 15:51 - Cindy L: probably not
2/3/16, 15:52 - Mom: can i say that ur not conscious at that time?
2/3/16, 15:53 - Cindy L: no because i managed to collect all that data
2/3/16, 15:54 - Cindy L: and remember all of it
2/3/16, 15:54 - Cindy L: and wait out my seizure
2/3/16, 15:55 - Cindy L: and then check the time right after it
2/3/16, 15:55 - Cindy L: if that is not called conscious i don't know what is
2/3/16, 15:56 - Mom: how's ur daytime nap now? sleeping alot or little?
2/3/16, 15:56 - Cindy L: back to taking deliberate naps
2/3/16, 15:56 - Cindy L: unless i drink a lot the day before
2/3/16, 15:57 - Cindy L: or i'm reading lse 100 shit
2/3/16, 15:57 - Mom: do u hv 8 hrs sleep altogether including ur nap in the daytime?
2/3/16, 15:57 - Cindy L: hmm yea. i guess
2/3/16, 15:58 - Cindy L: i nap more in teh morning
2/3/16, 15:58 - Cindy L: my friend's dog died
2/3/16, 15:59 - Cindy L: it was having seizures a while ago
2/3/16, 15:59 - Mom: yea, u told me already
2/3/16, 15:59 - Mom: omg
2/3/16, 15:59 - Mom: relax
2/3/16, 16:01 - Mom: is the dog having other serious infection or illness?
2/3/16, 16:01 - Cindy L: old age?
2/3/16, 16:01 - Cindy L: i couldn't eat a lot
2/3/16, 16:01 - Cindy L: if it ate a lot, it had seizures.
2/3/16, 16:01 - Cindy L: which was similar to my earlier experiences
2/3/16, 16:02 - Mom: is that abt the food?
2/3/16, 16:02 - Cindy L: no, they couldn't feed it too much afterwards
2/3/16, 16:04 - Cindy L: i'm looking at types of seizures
2/3/16, 16:03 - Mom: so whatever food u ate alot, u'll get seizure?
2/3/16, 16:03 - Mom: have u gain weigh?
2/3/16, 16:04 - Cindy L: and so far i think simple seizures fit what i'm getting the most
2/3/16, 16:04 - Mom: still taking those supplements i gave u?
2/3/16, 16:05 - Cindy L: er pretty much
2/3/16, 16:05 - Cindy L: like heavy meals --> then i'd go into clonus and pass out
2/3/16, 16:06 - Cindy L: that was before
2/3/16, 16:06 - Cindy L: i still need some sort of catalytic event
2/3/16, 16:06 - Cindy L: i.e. like sudden raise of HR
2/3/16, 16:06 - Cindy L: or sudden emotional change
2/3/16, 16:08 - Mom: b4 need catalytic event or now need them?
2/3/16, 16:08 - Cindy L: erm now
2/3/16, 16:08 - Mom: to cause seizure
2/3/16, 16:08 - Cindy L: before not so sure
2/3/16, 16:08 - Cindy L: now i think they tend to happen with stimulus
2/3/16, 16:08 - Cindy L: before
2/3/16, 16:08 - Cindy L: sometimes i get them when i'm just using the computer
2/3/16, 16:08 - Cindy L: but i do look at emotional affecting content
2/3/16, 16:09 - Cindy L: so i think that counts as stimulus too
2/3/16, 16:09 - Cindy L: to be fair
2/3/16, 16:10 - Cindy L: i'm pretty certain they're simple seizures now
2/3/16, 16:10 - Cindy L: symptoms can be: motor, autonomic, sensory, or psychological
2/3/16, 16:10 - Cindy L: i get motor, sensory and psychological
2/3/16, 16:10 - Cindy L: i forgot to mention
2/3/16, 16:10 - Cindy L: i actually heard the guy say a phrase in my left ear
2/3/16, 16:11 - Mom: what is that phrase?
2/3/16, 16:11 - Cindy L: can't remember
2/3/16, 16:11 - Cindy L: it was in cantonese
2/3/16, 16:11 - Mom: everytime left ear?
2/3/16, 16:11 - Cindy L: not everytime
2/3/16, 16:11 - Cindy L: sometimes i feel a touch
2/3/16, 16:12 - Mom: do u feel the temperature of the touch?
2/3/16, 16:12 - Cindy L: not in that much detail
2/3/16, 16:12 - Cindy L: its more just the pressure
2/3/16, 16:13 - Cindy L: but that's also when i started getting quite strong tactile responses in my vivid dreams as well
2/3/16, 16:13 - Cindy L: like yesterday
2/3/16, 16:13 - Cindy L: i fell asleep in my chair after washing my hair
2/3/16, 16:14 - Cindy L: and i had a very vivid dream
2/3/16, 16:14 - Cindy L: literally it was like i was there.
2/3/16, 16:15 - Mom: is ur dream scary?
2/3/16, 16:15 - Cindy L: er yea near the end
2/3/16, 16:16 - Cindy L: they tried to strap me to this chair which will send shocks to my spine
2/3/16, 16:16 - Cindy L: beginning was okay, it was just going to the place.
2/3/16, 16:17 - Cindy L: and falling is always very real
2/3/16, 16:17 - Cindy L: the feeling of falling in my dreams are so real, i actually get a bit scared and worrry about how to land
2/3/16, 16:17 - Mom: falling from high places?
2/3/16, 16:17 - Cindy L: yes
2/3/16, 16:18 - Cindy L: and then u know how when u walk through a bush, u feel the prickles from the leaves and branches?
2/3/16, 16:18 - Cindy L: i felt everything.
2/3/16, 16:19 - Mom: when u wake up, did u hurt or see marks?
2/3/16, 16:19 - Cindy L: no
2/3/16, 16:19 - Cindy L: its' not supernatural man
2/3/16, 16:19 - Cindy L: and then throughout the whole thing, i can feel a pair of hands holding me in place.
2/3/16, 16:19 - Cindy L: u know  like how a cop holds a criminal in place
2/3/16, 16:19 - Cindy L: like thata
2/3/16, 16:19 - Cindy L: i think it was supposed to be a skeleton
2/3/16, 16:20 - Cindy L: cuz i remember lying down on an altar/grave
2/3/16, 16:20 - Cindy L: in front of a gravestone
2/3/16, 16:20 - Cindy L: i think i probably died.
2/3/16, 16:20 - Cindy L: explains the falling
2/3/16, 16:20 - Cindy L: yea so i lied down on the grave
2/3/16, 16:20 - Cindy L: and then fell deep into it
2/3/16, 16:21 - Cindy L: went through a bunch of vines and leaves
2/3/16, 16:21 - Cindy L: and then ended up in some abandoned factory like place
2/3/16, 16:21 - Cindy L: there i kept seeing a bunch of floating hooded creatures
2/3/16, 16:21 - Cindy L: kinda looked like deatheaters from harry potter
2/3/16, 16:22 - Cindy L: lol
2/3/16, 16:22 - Cindy L: i tried to close my eyes
2/3/16, 16:22 - Cindy L: and i still saw the scene so that's when i realise it was a dream.
2/3/16, 16:22 - Cindy L: i.e. i couldn't avoid looking at the scene
2/3/16, 16:23 - Mom: like acting out a scary movies
2/3/16, 16:23 - Cindy L: and then basically they led me to this metal contraption
2/3/16, 16:24 - Cindy L: and for reason i saw the thing and i knew it was for sending electric shocks
2/3/16, 16:26 - Cindy L: i guess cuz there was this black cushion seat and then this part which curved around ur hip and in the middle (where the base of ur spine is) there was this electrode
2/3/16, 16:27 - Cindy L: oh so they fastened me to the chair
2/3/16, 16:27 - Cindy L: and then i finally see the face of the guy who was behind me
2/3/16, 16:27 - Cindy L: it was some chinese guy which i didn't know
2/3/16, 16:27 - Cindy L: but i felt like i recognized him from somewhere like tv
2/3/16, 16:28 - Mom: tv in hk?
2/3/16, 16:28 - Cindy L: yep
2/3/16, 16:28 - Cindy L: so at this point i was very conscious
2/3/16, 16:28 - Cindy L: so i tried to keep calm to see where this is going
2/3/16, 16:28 - Cindy L: i mean i knew they were gonna torture me
2/3/16, 16:28 - Cindy L: but
2/3/16, 16:29 - Cindy L: u know i was curious cuz i knew it was a dream
2/3/16, 16:30 - Cindy L: but i woke up cuz i was took scared of electric shocks
2/3/16, 16:30 - Cindy L: so we shall never know what happens next. :(
2/3/16, 16:31 - Cindy L: damn, and this was how medium was written.
2/3/16, 16:31 - Cindy L: i woke up and found myself sleeping in my chair
2/3/16, 16:32 - Cindy L: what do you think?
2/3/16, 16:32 - Mom: u look like acting out a movies from ur dream
2/3/16, 16:34 - Cindy L: its like
2/3/16, 16:35 - Cindy L: supernatural meets alice in wonderland meets harry potter
2/3/16, 16:35 - Cindy L: if u want it in movie terms
2/3/16, 16:35 - Cindy L: i dreamt of a really cool scifi plot the other night
2/3/16, 16:33 - Mom: how long u've slept?
2/3/16, 16:36 - Cindy L: it was a bit like extant though
2/3/16, 16:36 - Cindy L: its about hacking in a dead person's mind and then solving this murder mystery which involves alien experiments
2/3/16, 16:36 - Cindy L: lol is that a good pitch?
2/3/16, 16:37 - Cindy L: U mean how high am I?
2/3/16, 16:37 - Cindy L: I slept normal human hours
2/3/16, 16:37 - Cindy L: Like round 7
2/3/16, 16:38 - Cindy L: Or 8
2/3/16, 16:41 - Cindy L: i should write the pilot
2/3/16, 16:41 - Cindy L: see if channel 4 will take it
2/3/16, 16:42 - Cindy L: what's most annoying is that i literally have to deal with not being able to keep muscle tone all day.
2/3/16, 16:43 - Cindy L: and then i get breathless and ppl think i have problems, which is true
2/3/16, 16:46 - Mom: so u biggest prob now is muscle tone not sleeping?
2/3/16, 16:46 - Cindy L: Yea
2/3/16, 16:47 - Cindy L: But that's all u hv to say abt my amazing story?
2/3/16, 16:47 - Cindy L: I'm disappointed
2/3/16, 16:49 - Mom: i felt so unbelievable that ppl wud have such a cinematic dream
2/3/16, 16:49 - Cindy L: dude u its cinema 4D
2/3/16, 16:49 - Cindy L: see why i want to go into VR?
2/3/16, 16:49 - Cindy L: or at least developing apps for it
2/3/16, 16:49 - Cindy L: cuz its amazing
2/3/16, 16:50 - Cindy L: plus the timing would be right
2/3/16, 16:50 - Mom: it totally don't make sense cuz dreams used to be fragmented without any story but urs is just like a film
2/3/16, 16:50 - Cindy L: because google just made it affordable for everyone
2/3/16, 16:51 - Mom: then the design engrg program at imperial might not fitted ur dream
2/3/16, 16:51 - Cindy L: plus i have my media networks - i personally know programmers, animators, artists, musicians
2/3/16, 16:51 - Cindy L: do u think i should do that?
2/3/16, 16:52 - Mom: yea yea yea
2/3/16, 16:52 - Mom: bc that's ur aspiration
2/3/16, 16:52 - Cindy L: lol
2/3/16, 16:52 - Cindy L: i need a business model
2/3/16, 16:53 - Mom: then try again to convince imperial abt ur dream
2/3/16, 16:53 - Cindy L: nah if i'm gonna start my business i should stay here.
2/3/16, 16:54 - Mom: i mean how long ur vivid dream last when u were sitting in the chair yesterday?
2/3/16, 16:54 - Cindy L: hmmm
2/3/16, 16:54 - Cindy L: 30 mins to 50 mins?
2/3/16, 16:54 - Cindy L: not sure exact start time
2/3/16, 16:54 - Cindy L: i don't even remember falling asleep
2/3/16, 16:55 - Mom: quite long time like the duration of a movie
2/3/16, 16:55 - Cindy L: like a short film
2/3/16, 16:55 - Cindy L: but if i take 5htp pills, they go even weirder
2/3/16, 16:55 - Cindy L: lol
2/3/16, 16:56 - Mom: but those r happy dream right?
2/3/16, 16:56 - Cindy L: not exactly
2/3/16, 16:56 - Cindy L: just weird
2/3/16, 16:56 - Cindy L: remember the seeing god dream
2/3/16, 16:56 - Cindy L: weird like that
2/3/16, 16:56 - Mom: not scary?
2/3/16, 16:56 - Cindy L: creepy
2/3/16, 16:57 - Mom: better than seeing deatheaters
2/3/16, 16:58 - Cindy L: i also dream this idea for the next disney cartoon film
2/3/16, 16:58 - Mom: so i think we can conclude that it's the prob with the chemicals in ur brain causing these weird dreams and seizure
2/3/16, 16:58 - Cindy L: u think
2/3/16, 17:00 - Mom: psychological factors also lead to chemical imbalance
2/3/16, 17:00 - Cindy L: i think its the other way round though
2/3/16, 17:00 - Cindy L: its the chemicals whcih are causing the psychological crazy
2/3/16, 17:02 - Mom: but there must be a starting point, chemical imbalance or psycho factor first?
2/3/16, 17:03 - Mom: ok, i think u've to do ur work
2/3/16, 17:03 - Cindy L: chicken or the egg
2/3/16, 17:04 - Cindy L: it's too late to do work now

2/5/16, 01:12 - Cindy L: U're not even allowed to use a different method
2/5/16, 01:13 - Mom: what? no alternative method used?
2/5/16, 01:13 - Cindy L: And the funniest thing, u're not allowed to use ur own symbols

2/5/16, 04:29 - Mom: U don't hv to count on how many loops to go
2/5/16, 04:29 - Cindy L: Because they had a real looking signature

2/5/16, 07:46 - Mom: like other uni choose
2/5/16, 10:03 - Cindy L: Er yeah
2/5/16, 10:03 - Cindy L: I think I'll be in extra
2/5/16, 10:03 - Cindy L: But like my only other option is ucl
2/5/16, 10:03 - Mom: think abt it bc u can hv a relevant first deg in that case
2/5/16, 10:03 - Cindy L: I thought abt trying to transfer to columbia
2/5/16, 10:04 - Cindy L: Yea I know
2/5/16, 10:04 - Cindy L: But not sure if I will be sent to gs
2/5/16, 10:04 - Mom: it's difficult to transfer to columbia, but if u try that's good
2/5/16, 10:04 - Mom: errrr
2/5/16, 10:04 - Cindy L: I heard its easier to get into fu engineering schl
2/5/16, 10:04 - Mom: rlly
2/5/16, 10:05 - Cindy L: I'm not sure where neuroscience is though
2/5/16, 10:05 - Cindy L: I mean lse courses can count as core
2/5/16, 10:05 - Mom: neurosci is a master deg
2/5/16, 10:05 - Mom: u shud hv a first deg in abt biomedica
2/5/16, 10:05 - Cindy L: In Columbia?
2/5/16, 10:05 - Mom: neuorsci?
2/5/16, 10:05 - Cindy L: I don't think so
2/5/16, 10:06 - Cindy L: I dunno
2/5/16, 10:06 - Cindy L: Yea
2/5/16, 10:06 - Cindy L: Nuerosci
2/5/16, 10:06 - Cindy L: I hv basically Columbia, Michigan and cmu in mind
2/5/16, 10:06 - Mom: u can ask abt transfer first, and then select sci electives
2/5/16, 10:07 - Mom: ask la, tell them ur studying at lse and want for a transfer bc of the major?
2/5/16, 10:08 - Cindy L: Yea that's my plan
2/5/16, 10:08 - Cindy L: I was gonna just say that as reason for changing to another course anyways
2/5/16, 10:08 - Mom: anyway, lse has its benefit
2/5/16, 10:09 - Cindy L: I think Columbia would probably regard lse to be good
2/5/16, 10:09 - Mom: yea
2/5/16, 10:09 - Cindy L: But there's the gs issue
2/5/16, 10:09 - Mom: don't bother la
2/5/16, 10:10 - Cindy L: Ok
2/5/16, 10:10 - Mom: ur not cheating in any case
2/5/16, 10:10 - Mom: so, 1) transfer to usa and 2) think abt ucl engrg
2/5/16, 10:12 - Cindy L: Yea
2/5/16, 10:12 - Cindy L: I think ucl engineering will be quite chilled
2/5/16, 10:13 - Mom: why?
2/5/16, 10:13 - Cindy L: Because ucl are chill
2/5/16, 10:13 - Mom: easy?
2/5/16, 10:15 - Mom: but this is the way u can stay in london and do a sci deg, and also ucl has good reputation
2/5/16, 10:41 - Cindy L: yea i know
2/5/16, 10:41 - Cindy L: i'm not complaining if ucl neurosci or engineering takes me
2/5/16, 10:42 - Mom: ‚úå
2/5/16, 10:43 - Mom: best of luck
2/5/16, 10:43 - Cindy L: i should offer myself as specimen subject
2/5/16, 10:43 - Mom: don't try to do that, britain has lots of weird case!!!
2/5/16, 10:44 - Cindy L: they reject me cuz i'm not weird enough?
2/5/16, 10:44 - Cindy L: btw
2/5/16, 10:44 - Mom: what do u mean"reject"?
2/5/16, 10:44 - Cindy L: i discovered avocado has norepinephrine
2/5/16, 10:45 - Mom: so?
2/5/16, 10:45 - Cindy L: i always sleep after eating avocado and tomato salad
2/5/16, 10:45 - Cindy L: 9 times out of 10
2/5/16, 10:45 - Mom: so u think those r the cause for ur sleepiness?
2/5/16, 10:45 - Cindy L: that often
2/5/16, 10:45 - Cindy L: norepinephrine?
2/5/16, 10:45 - Mom: wow!!!
2/5/16, 10:45 - Cindy L: yea maybe
2/5/16, 10:46 - Cindy L: its always that dish
2/5/16, 10:46 - Mom: then u shud eat them before night time sleep
2/5/16, 10:46 - Cindy L: not sure if it works at night
2/5/16, 10:46 - Cindy L: anyways.
2/5/16, 10:46 - Cindy L: it get makes u nap, it doesn't do anything to prolong sleep
2/5/16, 10:47 - Cindy L: anyways
2/5/16, 10:47 - Mom: i rather thing it's the salad
2/5/16, 10:47 - Cindy L: no i made the salad
2/5/16, 10:47 - Cindy L: its only got tomatos and avocado
2/5/16, 10:47 - Cindy L: and lemon juice
2/5/16, 10:47 - Cindy L: and i've had it so many times.
2/5/16, 10:48 - Cindy L: anyways norepinephine is one of the 'fight vs flight' regulators
2/5/16, 10:48 - Cindy L: and it is metabolised from dopamine
2/5/16, 10:48 - Mom: bc i read that eating rough food makes ur gut difficult do ingestion and wud make ppl feel more sleepy
2/5/16, 10:49 - Cindy L: its not, that's just slight drowsiness
2/5/16, 10:49 - Cindy L: i'm talking about, just passing out, not realising when u even fell asleep
2/5/16, 10:49 - Cindy L: like if i had avocado salad and went out, I would fall asleep while walking
2/5/16, 10:50 - Mom: if u know it, then avoid it
2/5/16, 10:50 - Cindy L: anyhow it's metabolised from dopamine.
2/5/16, 10:50 - Cindy L: and dopamine is the happiness chemical
2/5/16, 10:51 - Cindy L: i mean norepinephrine is also one of the neurotransmitters u need for rem sleep
2/5/16, 10:52 - Mom: i mean if u realise the result, just avoid having these food before going out
2/5/16, 10:53 - Cindy L: i'm talking aboot a potential cause of my collapses!
2/5/16, 10:53 - Mom: got it
2/5/16, 10:53 - Mom: already
2/5/16, 10:54 - Mom: do u have a list of them?
2/5/16, 10:54 - Cindy L: list o fhwaT?
2/5/16, 10:55 - Mom: list of food causing sleepy/collapse
2/5/16, 11:05 - Emos: mops
2/5/16, 11:05 - Mom: present
2/5/16, 11:05 - Emos: did ms tsang send a shitload of videos
2/5/16, 11:06 - Mom: when?
2/5/16, 11:06 - Mom: didn't receive any
2/5/16, 11:07 - Emos: oh then maybe she hasnt send them yet
2/5/16, 11:07 - Mom: never receive until now
2/5/16, 11:07 - Emos: ok then
2/5/16, 11:11 - Cindy L: i don't have a list
2/5/16, 11:12 - Cindy L: i didn't even know it was avoados until i read abt norepinephrine
2/5/16, 11:12 - Mom: ok, i'll do some reserch
2/5/16, 13:37 - Cindy L: u know venlaflaxine is actually the newest antidepressant
2/5/16, 13:38 - Mom: i know
2/5/16, 13:38 - Mom: but there are a lot of side effects
2/5/16, 13:38 - Cindy L: do u remember any instances of my heart rate suddenly dropping?
2/5/16, 13:38 - Cindy L: i.e. when i have cataplexy?
2/5/16, 13:38 - Mom: when
2/5/16, 13:38 - Cindy L: before
2/5/16, 13:39 - Mom: i dont rmb la
2/5/16, 13:39 - Cindy L: i sort of remember u guys measured when i had cataplexy and my heart rate was very slow
2/5/16, 13:40 - Mom: i think so but i dont rmb when exactly
2/5/16, 13:40 - Cindy L: need to measure again then.
2/5/16, 13:40 - Mom: but i cant measure it now
2/5/16, 13:41 - Cindy L: look here it says
2/5/16, 13:41 - Cindy L: NE (norepinephrine) is responsible for the 'fight or flight
2/5/16, 13:41 - Cindy L: so when it increases ur HR
2/5/16, 13:41 - Cindy L: this can effect the release of glucose from ur energy stores
2/5/16, 13:41 - Cindy L: and blood flow to the SKELETAL muscles
2/5/16, 13:42 - Cindy L: so cataplexy would be the opposite
2/5/16, 13:42 - Cindy L: if HR decreased
2/5/16, 13:42 - Cindy L: then there would be less blood flow to the skeletal muscles.
2/5/16, 13:43 - Cindy L: and this can happen
2/5/16, 13:43 - Cindy L: cuz it mentions that it can affect vascular tone
2/5/16, 13:43 - Cindy L: that's the heart
2/5/16, 13:43 - Cindy L: and this can trigger the baroreceptor reflex, which causes bradycardia
2/5/16, 13:44 - Cindy L: which is a slowed heart rate
2/5/16, 13:44 - Cindy L: additionally
2/5/16, 13:45 - Cindy L: this is a homoestasis mechanism, which means it only lasts a very SHORT period of time
2/5/16, 13:45 - Cindy L: and tbh when i go weak, i don't loss COMPLETE control of my muscles
2/5/16, 13:45 - Cindy L: so actually diagnosis of cataplexy doesn't even make sense
2/5/16, 13:46 - Cindy L: and there's a whole lot of other stuff about NE which is quite convincing
2/5/16, 13:46 - Mom: this is the reason why i always don't convince ur cataplexy diagnosis
2/5/16, 13:47 - Cindy L: NE is also reponsible for panic attacks, which started getting a few weeks back
2/5/16, 13:48 - Cindy L: plus its very strange how my symptoms in london, are very different from symptoms in hk
2/5/16, 13:48 - Cindy L: that could be the avocado, because i eat them a lot here
2/5/16, 13:48 - Mom: i just rmb that everytime u had episode, i tried to measure ur BP but that fluctuated alot , so difficult to capture accurately
2/5/16, 13:48 - Cindy L: yea should get one of those finger ones
2/5/16, 13:49 - Mom: yea, i also notice a difference in hk and in london
2/5/16, 13:49 - Mom: u seems to have too much different incident in london rather than in hk
2/5/16, 13:49 - Mom: don't understand why
2/5/16, 13:49 - Cindy L: yah
2/5/16, 13:49 - Cindy L: i suppose
2/5/16, 13:50 - Mom: like hallucination
2/5/16, 13:50 - Cindy L: and seizures.
2/5/16, 13:50 - Cindy L: but i also had seizures back in hk
2/5/16, 13:51 - Mom: but u seems to hv more in uk right?
2/5/16, 13:52 - Cindy L: hmm dunno
2/5/16, 13:52 - Cindy L: the circumstances are a bit different
2/5/16, 13:52 - Mom: but i think food might be one of the reason for ur episode cuz they affect the neurotransmitters indeed
2/5/16, 13:53 - Cindy L: yea
2/5/16, 13:53 - Cindy L: i think my problem is probably that the monoamines cannot regulate themselves/ are out of balances
2/5/16, 13:54 - Cindy L: because it doesn't seem like just a simple low or high level sort of problem
2/5/16, 13:55 - Mom: but we can't and it's difficult to test which one or ones have prob
2/5/16, 13:55 - Mom: and i do believe that ur body is having sort of minor inflammation which might also affect those neurotransmitters
2/5/16, 13:56 - Mom: can u rmb that when u did the woman's u/s abt ur abdomen, is there anything  special there? any growth?
2/5/16, 14:00 - Cindy L: no
2/5/16, 14:01 - Cindy L: nothing
2/5/16, 14:01 - Cindy L: all clear
2/5/16, 14:01 - Cindy L: normal
2/5/16, 14:01 - Cindy L: i was just looking at GABA
2/5/16, 14:01 - Cindy L: so apparently that's supposed to regulate brain interaction and the other neurotransmitters
2/5/16, 14:02 - Cindy L: that looks convincing as well....
2/5/16, 14:02 - Cindy L: and its related to seizures
2/5/16, 14:02 - Cindy L: ü§î
2/5/16, 14:04 - Mom: i was just googling the Monoamine neurotransmitter
2/5/16, 14:05 - Cindy L: monoamines are norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine
2/5/16, 14:06 - Mom: yea, i was looking for more info
2/5/16, 14:07 - Cindy L: cool
2/5/16, 17:56 - Cindy L: Sooo
2/5/16, 17:56 - Cindy L: Columbia has a 3/2 combined plan program
2/5/16, 17:57 - Mom: ?
2/5/16, 17:57 - Cindy L: Essentially its 3 yrs ba and 2 yr s engineering
2/5/16, 17:57 - Cindy L: Lol.
2/5/16, 17:57 - Mom: This is gd
2/5/16, 17:57 - Cindy L: And apparently if u study the right courses and come from an affiliate college
2/5/16, 17:58 - Cindy L: U're guaranteed admission
2/5/16, 17:58 - Mom: What?
2/5/16, 17:58 - Cindy L: Yea I don't even know why this thing exists
2/5/16, 17:58 - Mom: But altogether 5 yrs for 2 bachelordegrees right?
2/5/16, 17:59 - Cindy L: Yah
2/5/16, 17:59 - Cindy L: Lol this is even better than dual ba
2/5/16, 18:00 - Mom: 5 yrs - one ba + or bsc
2/5/16, 18:01 - Cindy L: Yeah u matriculate at a lib college, so complete a ba
2/5/16, 18:01 - Cindy L: Then do two yrs of engineering which is a bsc
2/5/16, 18:01 - Cindy L: U get two degrees
2/5/16, 18:01 - Cindy L: In 5 yrs
2/5/16, 18:02 - Mom: Where did u get these info?
2/5/16, 18:02 - Cindy L: Googling Columbia transfer
2/5/16, 18:02 - Cindy L: Just search 3/2 combined plan program
2/5/16, 18:02 - Cindy L: They hv a brochure and everything.
2/5/16, 18:03 - Mom: ok
2/5/16, 18:04 - Mom: then wud u be in second yr if transfer
2/5/16, 18:08 - Cindy L: No u would transfer to a lib art
2/5/16, 18:09 - Cindy L: Then next yr apply for this thing.
2/5/16, 18:09 - Cindy L: Lol
2/5/16, 18:10 - Mom: So how many yr will be counted?
2/5/16, 18:14 - Cindy L: 5
2/5/16, 18:14 - Cindy L: Like u need three yr undergrad
2/5/16, 18:14 - Cindy L: In lib art
2/5/16, 18:15 - Cindy L: But essentially u do math, physics and comp sci during ur lib art yrs
2/5/16, 18:15 - Mom: Including yr at lse?
2/5/16, 18:15 - Cindy L: Depends what the other schl thinks I guess
2/5/16, 18:15 - Cindy L: But I think it would be better just to ask if I can transfer into seas.
2/5/16, 18:15 - Cindy L: Lol
2/5/16, 18:17 - Mom: But when u ask abt trf, wud u also mention 3/2 program?
2/5/16, 18:19 - Cindy L: no
2/5/16, 18:19 - Cindy L: ofc not
2/5/16, 18:19 - Cindy L: unless they recommend me to do this one
2/5/16, 18:20 - Mom: Then how come guaranted accepted?
2/5/16, 18:20 - Cindy L: u mean the 3/2 plan?
2/5/16, 18:21 - Cindy L: cuz u just need to meet the requirements
2/5/16, 18:21 - Cindy L: its not selective according to peoople
2/5/16, 18:21 - Mom: accepted by Columbia?
2/5/16, 18:22 - Cindy L: yes
2/5/16, 18:22 - Cindy L: did u see the brochure?

2/5/16, 18:22 - Cindy L: nv,
2/5/16, 18:22 - Cindy L: i do more research let u know later
2/5/16, 18:22 - Mom: I read it tmr morning
2/5/16, 18:27 - Cindy L: my watch strap just broke!
2/5/16, 18:27 - Cindy L: what cheap shit!
2/5/16, 18:28 - Mom: How much is it?
2/5/16, 18:28 - Mom: Made I China?
2/5/16, 18:28 - Mom: in
2/5/16, 18:29 - Cindy L: dunno
2/5/16, 18:29 - Cindy L: üò¢
2/5/16, 18:29 - Mom: Brand or no brand?
2/5/16, 18:30 - Cindy L: its nine west
2/5/16, 18:30 - Mom: Fashion brand only?
2/5/16, 18:30 - Cindy L: probs
2/5/16, 18:30 - Cindy L: it says simulated leather
2/5/16, 18:31 - Mom: Stimulated means derivative means fake
2/5/16, 18:32 - Cindy L: yeah i know
2/5/16, 18:32 - Mom: U shud get those if sports brand
2/5/16, 18:32 - Cindy L: well its only that thing which holds the strap at the end for now
2/5/16, 18:33 - Mom: still can wear?
2/5/16, 18:33 - Cindy L: yea
2/5/16, 18:34 - Mom: üò•
2/5/16, 18:34 - Cindy L: why are u worried?
2/5/16, 18:35 - Mom: No
2/5/16, 18:35 - Mom: Worry what?
2/5/16, 18:36 - Mom: I just thought that icon looks unhappy
2/5/16, 18:36 - Cindy L: that's the worry emoji
2/5/16, 18:36 - Mom: I don't know ah
2/5/16, 18:36 - Cindy L: ‚òπ this is unhappy
2/5/16, 18:36 - Mom: üòÖ
2/5/16, 18:37 - Cindy L: that's the 'awkward laugh in attempt to laugh things off as a joke, but its not working and you're out of ideas'
2/5/16, 18:38 - Mom: Nvm
2/5/16, 18:38 - Cindy L: üò™ this is me in teh library
2/5/16, 18:38 - Cindy L: hahahaha
2/5/16, 18:39 - Mom: Bc u don't sleep at ur dorm at night
2/5/16, 18:40 - Cindy L: no that's me in the afternoon
2/5/16, 18:40 - Cindy L: at night i üò¥
2/5/16, 18:40 - Cindy L: in bed
2/5/16, 18:41 - Cindy L: until 4 and then üò°
2/5/16, 18:41 - Cindy L: hahaha
2/5/16, 18:42 - Mom: But u used to sleep late at night
2/5/16, 18:42 - Cindy L: not always
2/5/16, 18:42 - Cindy L: normally its like i nap before bed
2/6/16, 09:04 - Cindy L: So
2/6/16, 09:04 - Mom: how's ur day?
2/6/16, 09:04 - Cindy L: I discovered why I don't collapse when drinking alcohol lol
2/6/16, 09:04 - Cindy L: It increases gaba
2/6/16, 09:05 - Mom: ru preparing to drink for the rest of ur life?
2/6/16, 09:05 - Cindy L: So yesterday I basically had dinner and i almost fell walking back
2/6/16, 09:05 - Cindy L: I was wobbly and that was pretty bad
2/6/16, 09:05 - Cindy L: And then in comparison
2/6/16, 09:06 - Mom: u had ur dinner alone?
2/6/16, 09:06 - Cindy L: No with friends
2/6/16, 09:06 - Cindy L: So I had to hold on to somebody
2/6/16, 09:06 - Mom: like b4 after dinner at sam yeung?
2/6/16, 09:07 - Cindy L: No Sam yeung was  super bad
2/6/16, 09:07 - Cindy L: Just once
2/6/16, 09:07 - Cindy L: Like somehow just walking and talking abt mildly funny things
2/6/16, 09:08 - Cindy L: And then later I had a few shots and that was fine
2/6/16, 09:08 - Cindy L: Lol
2/6/16, 09:08 - Cindy L: Actually didn't feel weakness all night
2/6/16, 09:09 - Cindy L: But increase of gaba can lead to crash
2/6/16, 09:09 - Cindy L: üòì
2/6/16, 09:09 - Cindy L: Like a caffeine crash
2/6/16, 09:09 - Mom: ur mean u had dinner and walked wobbly b4 having alcohol, but after drinking alcohol situation improved
2/6/16, 09:09 - Cindy L: Yes
2/6/16, 09:09 - Cindy L: Like as a comparison experiment
2/6/16, 09:10 - Mom: shudn't be it the opposite for normal person?
2/6/16, 09:10 - Cindy L: Yea because normal ppl r lightweight and get drunk quickly
2/6/16, 09:11 - Cindy L: Basically I metabolise alcohol really quickly
2/6/16, 09:11 - Cindy L: And esp since we went out, that's good exercise so I used that energy up quickly too
2/6/16, 09:12 - Cindy L: If I sit and do nothing after drinking then I sober much slower
2/6/16, 09:12 - Mom: what u mean by "lightweight", ur overweight then show opposite response?
2/6/16, 09:12 - Cindy L: Lightweight means u have low tolerance
2/6/16, 09:12 - Cindy L: Overweight is body mass
2/6/16, 09:13 - Mom: u hv high tolerance for alcohol?
2/6/16, 09:13 - Cindy L: Yeah duh
2/6/16, 09:13 - Mom: how come? u hv been drinking alot/
2/6/16, 09:14 - Cindy L: Not really its just natural
2/6/16, 09:14 - Cindy L: I've never puked on the street I can tell u that
2/6/16, 09:14 - Cindy L: And I eat alot of protein
2/6/16, 09:15 - Cindy L: I guess that's why
2/6/16, 09:15 - Cindy L: Anyhow yea so alcohol increases gaba which I believe seems to be effective in preventing the collapses
2/6/16, 09:16 - Cindy L: Or episodes of weakness
2/6/16, 09:16 - Cindy L: Bad thing is I need my liver
2/6/16, 09:16 - Cindy L: And as I was saying u can crash on gaba
2/6/16, 09:17 - Cindy L: And withdrawal involve seizures
2/6/16, 09:18 - Cindy L: Ah I also had sort of a seizure yesterday in the afternoon.
2/6/16, 09:18 - Cindy L: So I was wondering whether my instances of seizures are gaba related
2/6/16, 09:19 - Cindy L: üòî unfortunately there is no way to test chemicals in the brain
2/6/16, 09:19 - Mom: <Media omitted>
2/6/16, 09:20 - Cindy L: Oh yeah that's my studd
2/6/16, 09:20 - Cindy L: Stuff
2/6/16, 09:20 - Cindy L: From when I was in hk
2/6/16, 09:21 - Mom: r they all ur purchases?
2/6/16, 09:21 - Cindy L: Yeah
2/6/16, 09:21 - Mom: check them and confirm
2/6/16, 09:21 - Cindy L: I checked twice already
2/6/16, 09:21 - Mom: especially the one shopped in luxembourg?
2/6/16, 09:22 - Cindy L: It's a game I bought online
2/6/16, 09:22 - Mom: ic
2/6/16, 09:22 - Cindy L: So the company is probably based in luxembourg
2/6/16, 09:22 - Cindy L: Cuz u know tax loophole
2/6/16, 09:22 - Mom: how long ur seizure lasted yesterday?
2/6/16, 09:23 - Cindy L: Er I needa check the length of that video
2/6/16, 09:23 - Cindy L: Around the same I guess
2/6/16, 09:23 - Cindy L: Mostly clonic
2/6/16, 09:24 - Mom: what can u think of the reason for these days' frequent seizure? withdrawal of alcohol?
2/6/16, 09:24 - Cindy L: Yeah and poor sleep
2/6/16, 09:24 - Mom: what u mean by "clonic"? trembling alot?
2/6/16, 09:24 - Cindy L: But I actually slept 9 hrs on weds--thur
2/6/16, 09:24 - Mom: or jerking?
2/6/16, 09:25 - Cindy L: Like shaking
2/6/16, 09:25 - Cindy L: Trembling
2/6/16, 09:25 - Cindy L: Not jerks, those r myoclonic
2/6/16, 09:25 - Mom: u've been drinking alot these days?
2/6/16, 09:25 - Cindy L: No last time was last week when my friends can down
2/6/16, 09:25 - Cindy L: Came
2/6/16, 09:25 - Cindy L: That time was quite a lot with half the prosecco
2/6/16, 09:26 - Mom: how's the magnitude of the shaking? large or just minor which can't be noticed by eyesight
2/6/16, 09:26 - Cindy L: U can notice in hand
2/6/16, 09:26 - Cindy L: But face not so much
2/6/16, 09:27 - Mom: like ppl with Alzheimer?
2/6/16, 09:27 - Cindy L: And if I stop resisting and relax my body, I.e. lie down
2/6/16, 09:27 - Cindy L: It just goes paralyzed
2/6/16, 09:27 - Cindy L: Never seen Alzheimer's patients
2/6/16, 09:27 - Cindy L: So can't compare
2/6/16, 09:27 - Mom: ?
2/6/16, 09:28 - Cindy L: Like of i stop trying to move
2/6/16, 09:28 - Mom: what abt ur mouth? also shaking/jerking?
2/6/16, 09:28 - Cindy L: If I stop trying to move
2/6/16, 09:28 - Mom: google it on website to see sample of Alzheimer's patients
2/6/16, 09:28 - Cindy L: When the arms stop shaking the jaw trembles
2/6/16, 09:29 - Mom: so they're in sequence not simultaneously trembling?
2/6/16, 09:29 - Cindy L: Yea
2/6/16, 09:30 - Mom: which part comes trembling first? arms or jaw?
2/6/16, 09:30 - Cindy L: Hands
2/6/16, 09:30 - Cindy L: Always

2/6/16, 09:31 - Cindy L: Yes
2/6/16, 09:31 - Cindy L: That's what I said a long time ago
2/6/16, 09:32 - Mom: but ur having quite frequent seizures these days, almost once everyday?
2/6/16, 09:32 - Mom: can u think of anything happened b4 those seizures?
2/6/16, 09:32 - Mom: like food eaten or emotions change?
2/6/16, 09:32 - Mom: sleep pattern?
2/6/16, 09:50 - Mom: http://www.lse.ac.uk/intranet/LSEServices/academicPartnerships/lseBerkeleyUGstudentExchange.aspx
2/6/16, 10:31 - Cindy L: What omg
2/6/16, 10:31 - Cindy L: I'll ask them if I can take science courses
2/6/16, 10:31 - Cindy L: Yayy yayay
2/6/16, 10:32 - Cindy L: I hope they only demand 2;1
2/6/16, 10:32 - Mom: did u read the link
2/6/16, 10:32 - Mom: that said a high 2:2 is a minimum
2/6/16, 10:33 - Cindy L: No I don't read more than ten words lol
2/6/16, 10:35 - Cindy L: Cheers only ten places üòí
2/6/16, 10:35 - Cindy L: Cherr
2/6/16, 10:35 - Cindy L: And PS again?
2/6/16, 10:35 - Cindy L: I might as well beg for a transfer
2/6/16, 10:35 - Mom: what ps?
2/6/16, 10:36 - Cindy L: Personal statement
2/6/16, 10:36 - Mom: that's for student exchange only
2/6/16, 10:36 - Cindy L: Yes I know
2/6/16, 10:37 - Mom: so why ps? i don't know
2/6/16, 10:37 - Cindy L: Cuz they only hv 10 places üòí
2/6/16, 10:37 - Mom: so it's competitive i think
2/6/16, 10:38 - Cindy L: Yeah that's why u need a ps
2/6/16, 10:38 - Mom: and only open for second year student
2/6/16, 10:38 - Cindy L: Oh
2/6/16, 10:38 - Cindy L: Okay nvm
2/6/16, 10:39 - Mom: i just say that lse might be a good name for asking transfer to other well-known uni
2/6/16, 10:40 - Cindy L: Oh yeah definitely
2/6/16, 10:40 - Cindy L: Never doubted that
2/6/16, 10:40 - Mom: so u need to maintain a good relationship with lse, don't spoil that competitive advantage
2/6/16, 10:41 - Cindy L: I pay my fees dw
2/6/16, 10:41 - Cindy L: And I don't go around screaming fuck lse
2/6/16, 10:41 - Cindy L: And I use their readings.
2/6/16, 10:41 - Mom: many ppl in lse don't pay fee and go around screaming?
2/6/16, 10:41 - Cindy L: Come on they should love me
2/6/16, 10:42 - Cindy L: Yea
2/6/16, 10:42 - Cindy L: Ppl who keep campaigning to cut fees lol
2/6/16, 10:42 - Cindy L: And people who hate the lse cuz they hv miserable lives
2/6/16, 10:43 - Mom: 9000pp is universal in uk
2/6/16, 10:43 - Cindy L: Yea but it used to be ¬£3000
2/6/16, 10:43 - Mom: and the international fee indeed is not that high compared to that of imperial
2/6/16, 10:43 - Cindy L: Ppl don't really get the idea of inflation here.
2/6/16, 10:44 - Cindy L: And welfare is like expected
2/6/16, 10:44 - Cindy L: Because welfare state
2/6/16, 10:44 - Cindy L: Whereas, elsewhere in the world, no welfare
2/6/16, 10:44 - Mom: in fact, brits r so old-fashion
2/6/16, 10:44 - Cindy L: Actually not really.
2/6/16, 10:44 - Cindy L: They r conservative
2/6/16, 10:45 - Cindy L: But development-wise they r at the front.
2/6/16, 10:45 - Mom: i mean ppl there not rlly thinking in line with the growing world
2/6/16, 10:45 - Cindy L: Technically u can say that the welfare state is the most developed form of civil society.
2/6/16, 10:45 - Mom: the front? which aspect?
2/6/16, 10:46 - Cindy L: Welfare wise
2/6/16, 10:46 - Cindy L: Lol
2/6/16, 10:46 - Mom: therefore, no more room for development?
2/6/16, 10:46 - Mom: but welfare need money to backup
2/6/16, 10:46 - Cindy L: Well the welfare state is so big and expensive already, what else is there to change
2/6/16, 10:47 - Cindy L: U can barely do anything abt economy cuz u hv this thing in place where u cant really do anything abt
2/6/16, 10:47 - Cindy L: It's like japan.
2/6/16, 10:48 - Cindy L: And then tbh ur human capital isn't really the most innovative ppl in the world
2/6/16, 10:48 - Cindy L: Since all they do is get drunk
2/6/16, 10:48 - Cindy L: And chill
2/6/16, 10:49 - Cindy L: It's kind of downhill.
2/6/16, 10:49 - Mom: the career prospect in uk looks so gloomy for the youth then?
2/6/16, 10:49 - Cindy L: But I think the worst thing is that the ppl aren't forward thinking.
2/6/16, 10:50 - Cindy L: They just live every day, one day at a time.
2/6/16, 10:50 - Mom: that's is exactly what i meant they're not growing with the world's pace
2/6/16, 10:50 - Cindy L: Or maybe I've only met trashy people.
2/6/16, 10:51 - Cindy L: This is strangely familiar to the great Gatsby period...
2/6/16, 10:52 - Mom: sigh, every time u talked wud link to film!!!
2/6/16, 10:54 - Cindy L: Mopps its a book
2/6/16, 10:54 - Mom: kkkk
2/6/16, 10:54 - Cindy L: It's also the best book in American literature
2/6/16, 10:54 - Cindy L: There's a reason for that.
2/6/16, 10:56 - Cindy L: Even turver says so
2/6/16, 10:56 - Cindy L: And turver is a poet
2/6/16, 10:57 - Mom: kok
2/6/16, 10:58 - Cindy L: It's a great book
2/6/16, 10:58 - Cindy L: Ofc most of my friends hate it
2/6/16, 10:58 - Mom: i see
2/6/16, 10:58 - Cindy L: They also have catcher in the rye
2/6/16, 10:58 - Mom: why?
2/6/16, 10:58 - Cindy L: That's my favourite book
2/6/16, 10:58 - Cindy L: Cuz they think it's boring.
2/6/16, 17:53 - Cindy L: <Media omitted>
2/6/16, 17:53 - Cindy L: Lol look at that, heiman does a lot of these things.
2/7/16, 02:03 - Mom: so, don't understand why she wud have emotional prob during ib yr12?
2/7/16, 05:12 - Mom: http://narcolepsynetwork.org/about-narcolepsy/treatment/tips-for-wakefulness/
2/7/16, 05:12 - Mom: this is the way pp manage their life style and their determination
2/7/16, 05:15 - Cindy L: Sure
2/7/16, 05:15 - Cindy L: Take meds on time and as prescribed
2/7/16, 05:15 - Cindy L: U realise most of these people don't have muscle atonia
2/7/16, 05:16 - Cindy L: That's why they can get better by 'willpower'
2/7/16, 06:10 - Mom: "meds" r not the main cure, haven't u seen many ppl suffering from same disorders having serious side-effect after taking meds for a period  of time and had to quit them eventually
2/7/16, 07:29 - Cindy L: I quoted that line sarcastically
2/7/16, 07:29 - Cindy L: Someone should really invent sarcism marks for thick ppl
2/7/16, 07:31 - Cindy L: And u hv no idea what I go through each day. I'm not depressed abt it anymore, cuz if I was, I would be suicidal
2/7/16, 07:32 - Cindy L: So no need to send me these self help things. I already know that changing ur lifestyle can help u sleep betterml, duh
2/7/16, 07:34 - Cindy L: I hate reading these things cuz they do not need to deal with physical seizures and collapsing every single day.
2/7/16, 07:34 - Mom: but even if u go see the drs, they also wud give similar advice, so how to help?
2/7/16, 07:36 - Mom: just give up?
2/7/16, 07:37 - Cindy L: Yea there's nothing to be done until more research comes out
2/7/16, 07:37 - Cindy L: There's nothing I can do to help myself
2/7/16, 07:37 - Cindy L: In terms of those seizures and atonia eps
2/7/16, 07:43 - Cindy L: Also remember the boy I told u I met in Starbucks in tsing yi, who managed to inspire me enough out of depression for a while like two weeks?
2/7/16, 07:43 - Cindy L: Guess what happened to him
2/7/16, 07:43 - Mom: ?
2/7/16, 07:45 - Mom: the one who is very well-versed with physics but still got predicted ib points 30+?
2/7/16, 08:09 - Mom: if u do believe in sci and tech principles, u shud act like the person in the link i just sent u cuz u sci things must have rigid principles and rules and if u can stick to these rules u can achieve the same result
2/7/16, 08:10 - Mom: i mean if u intentionally allow a freestyle life, ur not going to improve ur systoms but migt rather to make it worse
2/7/16, 08:13 - Mom: SOME ppl around u might indeed want to offer help
2/7/16, 08:14 - Mom: that's why we advise u to try maintain regular sleep period, eat healthy food, do exercise, do yoga, meditation...etc
2/7/16, 08:19 - Mom: these r the presumed good advice for everyone suffering from illness, and other than that some wud advise sticking to religious beliefs, worship the Buddha or "wong tai sin" or go "ÊâìÂ∞è‰∫∫"
2/7/16, 08:19 - Mom: the point is we do want u get well and having improvements to ur daily life
2/7/16, 09:35 - Cindy L: Yeah that guy
2/7/16, 09:35 - Cindy L: He ended up with schizophrenia
2/7/16, 09:36 - Mom: how do u know?
2/7/16, 09:36 - Cindy L: Fb
2/7/16, 09:36 - Mom: shudn't be himself, his friends' fb?
2/7/16, 09:37 - Cindy L: What do u mean?
2/7/16, 09:37 - Cindy L: From what I can glean, it sounded like schizophrenia
2/7/16, 09:37 - Mom: i mean which fb u saw this news?
2/7/16, 09:37 - Cindy L: His fb obviously.
2/7/16, 09:38 - Cindy L: Some people share everything on fb
2/7/16, 09:38 - Mom: he wrote down his emotions and u judge him of schizo?
2/7/16, 09:39 - Cindy L: No he talked abt not being abt to make a voice shut up in his head for godsake
2/7/16, 09:39 - Cindy L: And then since last yr he just disappeared
2/7/16, 09:40 - Cindy L: Doesn't take a Sherlock Holmes to put two and two together
2/7/16, 09:40 - Mom: he has auditory hallucinations?
2/7/16, 09:41 - Mom: i never read/see Sherlock Holmes book/movies, i don't know what happen there
2/7/16, 09:42 - Mom: can i clarify something with u?
2/7/16, 09:42 - Mom: 1)  what is ur response after having msg?
2/7/16, 09:43 - Mom: 2) ur response after taking alcohol?
2/7/16, 09:44 - Mom: cuz as i understand from previous saying, u seems to have opposite response as described in the research papers
2/7/16, 09:46 - Cindy L: Msg?
2/7/16, 09:46 - Cindy L: Not sure
2/7/16, 09:46 - Mom: MSG
2/7/16, 09:46 - Cindy L: I just said that after the ramen from kanedaya I was super itchy
2/7/16, 09:46 - Cindy L: And this was a few months ago
2/7/16, 09:47 - Cindy L: So I SUSPECTED that it was msg
2/7/16, 09:47 - Mom: how abt ur energy level after having ramen?
2/7/16, 09:47 - Cindy L: Normal
2/7/16, 09:47 - Cindy L: It's noodles
2/7/16, 09:48 - Mom: do u also have muscles weakness after ramen?
2/7/16, 09:48 - Cindy L: Dunno
2/7/16, 09:48 - Cindy L: No
2/7/16, 09:48 - Cindy L: I hv yakisoba and soba soumen all the time
2/7/16, 09:48 - Mom: no seizures?
2/7/16, 09:48 - Cindy L: No
2/7/16, 09:49 - Mom: do u feel sleepy after that?
2/7/16, 09:49 - Cindy L: No
2/7/16, 09:50 - Cindy L: I said already the only food I have observed a relation with sleeping is avocados
2/7/16, 09:51 - Mom: i said i just want to clarify some facts, then 2) alcohol?
2/7/16, 09:51 - Cindy L: 2) alcohol --> raise in hr, no collapses or weakness
2/7/16, 09:53 - Mom: ok, can u share me the fb abt that guy u just said as i simply want to understand his systoms?
2/7/16, 09:53 - Cindy L: No
2/7/16, 09:53 - Cindy L: Why would I do that
2/7/16, 09:53 - Cindy L: All he wrote is that he can't make a voice shut up in his head.
2/7/16, 09:54 - Mom: i told u just want to learn more of his symptoms
2/7/16, 09:54 - Cindy L: That is literally all he wrote
2/7/16, 09:54 - Cindy L: And all we know
2/7/16, 09:54 - Cindy L: and that he went to visit a psychologist
2/7/16, 09:55 - Mom: do u know how long he had this voice?
2/7/16, 09:55 - Cindy L: From now?
2/7/16, 09:56 - Cindy L: He left to UK last yr
2/7/16, 09:56 - Cindy L: So a few months before that
2/7/16, 09:56 - Mom: since when?
2/7/16, 09:57 - Mom: sorry, what time u met him at Starbucks? yr12 or 13?
2/7/16, 10:01 - Cindy L: Yr 13, the fucked up yr
2/7/16, 10:01 - Cindy L: Lemme think
2/7/16, 10:01 - Cindy L: OK schizophrenia is a bit if an exaggeration but
2/7/16, 10:01 - Cindy L: Anxiety
2/7/16, 10:01 - Cindy L: Ok
2/7/16, 10:02 - Cindy L: I know so many ppl who had anxiety and depression its starting to creep me out
2/7/16, 10:02 - Cindy L: Like they went to see a psychologist and shit
2/7/16, 10:03 - Cindy L: I mean u dont go see a mental health doc without actually feeling like u hv a problem.
2/7/16, 10:03 - Cindy L: I hv another friend who Skipped 50% of yr 13 cuz of anxiety
2/7/16, 10:04 - Cindy L: But whatever.
2/7/16, 10:05 - Cindy L: Just wanted to rant abt how fucked up kids in HK are.
2/7/16, 10:05 - Cindy L: I mean people only tend to fall into depression easily if they hv no social support like being in some hostile environment like 1st yr LSE
2/7/16, 10:07 - Mom: so u think ur not having social support in lse is the main reason for ur anxiety and emotional probs now?
2/7/16, 10:07 - Cindy L: I don't hv emotional problems.
2/7/16, 10:07 - Cindy L: My depression is pretty much fixed already.
2/7/16, 10:08 - Cindy L: I hv intense chemical fluctuations in my brain
2/7/16, 10:08 - Cindy L: It is purely a PHYSICAL problem, that is why I stress I have a neuromuscular disorder
2/7/16, 10:09 - Cindy L: And yes I hv mood swings, but that is just because I am prone to hormone changes
2/7/16, 10:09 - Mom: what do u think is the reason for ur brain's chemical fluctation?
2/7/16, 10:09 - Cindy L: Dude
2/7/16, 10:09 - Cindy L: If I knew
2/7/16, 10:09 - Cindy L: I wouldn't be collapsing everyday would i
2/7/16, 10:10 - Cindy L: I don't think it's fun to not be able to laugh and tell jokes.
2/7/16, 10:10 - Mom: not intending to challenge u, but just trying to understand more how u think and feel at london
2/7/16, 10:11 - Mom: maybe, life is not in ur direction that makes u frustrated and have stress
2/7/16, 10:13 - Cindy L: I think and feel fine.
2/7/16, 10:13 - Cindy L: Trust me, I got my confidence back.
2/7/16, 10:13 - Cindy L: I even go around insulting people on a whim.
2/7/16, 10:14 - Cindy L: Yah I know I hv stress
2/7/16, 10:14 - Mom: i'm thinking if taking supplements increasing GABA wud help ur anxiety
2/7/16, 10:14 - Cindy L: But tbh this amount of stress doesn't lead to brain damage
2/7/16, 10:15 - Cindy L: Yea the only method I know to prevent muscles from weakening is increasing gaba
2/7/16, 10:15 - Cindy L: At least I hv one method now.
2/7/16, 10:16 - Cindy L: But artificially increasing gaba will lead to seizures when u crash.
2/7/16, 10:16 - Cindy L: Which r not fun.
2/7/16, 10:16 - Cindy L: That's a worry
2/7/16, 10:17 - Mom: i still don't think u had brain damage, but there must be some imbalance of the chemicals inside ur brain or kind of transmission probs
2/7/16, 10:18 - Mom: ofc, we have to be very caution abt the dosage
2/7/16, 10:18 - Mom: moreover, u can't take gaba supplements directly cause there is bbb prob
2/7/16, 10:18 - Cindy L: I know
2/7/16, 10:18 - Mom: what u can intake is its pre-cursor
2/7/16, 10:18 - Cindy L: Msg
2/7/16, 10:18 - Cindy L: Lol
2/7/16, 10:18 - Cindy L: I saw thay
2/7/16, 10:18 - Cindy L: That
2/7/16, 10:19 - Mom: not msg
2/7/16, 10:19 - Cindy L: It is glutamic acid
2/7/16, 10:19 - Mom: taking msg have opposite effect
2/7/16, 10:19 - Cindy L: Why
2/7/16, 10:19 - Cindy L: Glutamic acid is the precursor
2/7/16, 10:19 - Cindy L: Glutamate
2/7/16, 10:19 - Mom: no
2/7/16, 10:20 - Mom: glutamate is the exciting neurotransmitter opposite to gaba
2/7/16, 10:20 - Mom: gaba has calming effect
2/7/16, 10:21 - Mom: L-Theanine which is found in Green Tea
2/7/16, 10:21 - Mom: Phenibut which is a derivative of GABA that can get across the blood-brain barrier and stimulate your receptors for this neurotransmitter to promote calm and tranquility. Another choice is Picamilon which breaks down into GABA and once it reaches your brain.
2/7/16, 10:22 - Mom: these 3 r the pre-curors
2/7/16, 10:22 - Mom: of gaba
2/7/16, 10:23 - Cindy L: I hv been drinking green tea since the beginning of my life
2/7/16, 10:23 - Cindy L: I can take these: Agonists/Positive allosteric modulators: ethanol,[44][45][46] barbiturates, benzodiazepines, carisoprodol, chloral hydrate, etaqualone, etomidate, glutethimide, kava, methaqualone, muscimol, neuroactive steroids, z-drugs, propofol, skullcap, valerian, theanine, volatile/inhaled anaesthetics.
2/7/16, 10:24 - Cindy L: See ethanol is an agonist
2/7/16, 10:24 - Cindy L: Basically depressants
2/7/16, 10:24 - Cindy L: Makes sense, it causes brain functions to slow down
2/7/16, 10:25 - Mom: yea, ethanol is a depressant
2/7/16, 10:25 - Cindy L: Prevents signals from spreading in the brain too quickly
2/7/16, 10:25 - Cindy L: That's how u get a seizure
2/7/16, 10:25 - Mom: but ur experience with alcohol looks opposite
2/7/16, 10:25 - Cindy L: What do you mean?
2/7/16, 10:25 - Cindy L: It's in line to me.
2/7/16, 10:26 - Cindy L: Less weakness, means that the faulty signal doesn't spread through the brain as easily.
2/7/16, 10:27 - Mom: no, seizure comes from ur brain firing more oftenly rather than slow firing
2/7/16, 10:27 - Cindy L: Yea I never said alcohol increases seizures now did i
2/7/16, 10:28 - Cindy L: I said WITHDRAWL gives u seizures
2/7/16, 10:29 - Mom: is ur seizures related to withdrawal of alcohol? i doubt unless ur consumption is pretty hugh
2/7/16, 10:36 - Cindy L: Then poor sleep quality that was the only factors there are
2/7/16, 10:37 - Mom: so u think ur sleep quality in uk is even worse than that in hk?
2/7/16, 10:37 - Mom: which makes u having more seizures in uk than in hk?
2/7/16, 10:49 - Cindy L: I think sleep quality in general is bad
2/7/16, 10:49 - Cindy L: No difference between UK and h
2/7/16, 10:49 - Cindy L: Hk
2/7/16, 10:49 - Cindy L: UK is more regulate tbh
2/7/16, 10:49 - Cindy L: I dont even know if I hv more seizures in UK than hk
2/7/16, 10:49 - Cindy L: From what I rmb, I had them pretty often in HK too
2/7/16, 10:51 - Cindy L: I just didn't write them down as muxh
2/7/16, 10:51 - Cindy L: Much
2/7/16, 10:52 - Cindy L: So theanine is the supplement
2/7/16, 10:53 - Mom: L-theanine is supplement
2/7/16, 10:53 - Mom: the 3 i mentioned abt is said to be pretty safe
2/7/16, 10:54 - Mom: rather than the drugs u listed out
2/7/16, 10:55 - Cindy L: How many gallons of green tea do u think I would have to drink to hv any effect?
2/7/16, 10:55 - Mom: joking la
2/7/16, 10:55 - Cindy L: So that's off
2/7/16, 10:56 - Cindy L: Anyways I already drink green tea
2/7/16, 10:56 - Mom: u can take L-theanine supplement
2/7/16, 10:56 - Mom: gd ah
2/7/16, 10:56 - Cindy L: The agonist worked better than the pre cursor
2/7/16, 10:57 - Cindy L: Maybe its receptor problem??
2/7/16, 10:58 - Mom: u mean the agonist r gaba?
2/7/16, 10:58 - Cindy L: No ethanol is an agonist
2/7/16, 10:58 - Cindy L: Agonist means it supports uptake
2/7/16, 10:59 - Mom: all those can pass through the bbb?
2/7/16, 10:59 - Cindy L: Yes ethanol and all those can pass the bbb
2/7/16, 10:59 - Cindy L: They are psychoactive drugs
2/7/16, 11:00 - Mom: u can get these psycho drugs otc?
2/7/16, 11:00 - Cindy L: No
2/7/16, 11:00 - Mom: and they don't have any side effects?
2/7/16, 11:00 - Cindy L: Addiction
2/7/16, 11:00 - Cindy L: Why is my life so sad
2/7/16, 11:01 - Mom: then why not try the pre-curosrs which r supposed to be more safe?
2/7/16, 11:02 - Cindy L: Because they don't work
2/7/16, 11:02 - Cindy L: I'm gonna order a theanine supplement first to see
2/7/16, 11:03 - Cindy L: Though omg
2/7/16, 11:03 - Mom: https://www.google.com.hk/imgres?imgurl=http://www.solgar.com/pub/products/20110905121624_2706.jpg&imgrefurl=http://www.solgar.com/solgarproducts/l-theanine-150-mg-vegetable-capsules.htm&h=642&w=350&tbnid=8sP0GnrAnUXgXM:&tbnh=160&tbnw=87&docid=zh_WvRMQEF0a7M&itg=1&usg=__1wLZ20rcSCGfQ8Ua-nGlKs7_diI=
2/7/16, 11:03 - Cindy L: I hv to say I finally feel like we're making progress here
2/7/16, 11:04 - Mom: this brand is better: solgar
2/7/16, 11:04 - Cindy L: Ok
2/7/16, 11:04 - Cindy L: No promises it will work
2/7/16, 11:05 - Mom: do u think that sitting and blaming for fate is better than trying ways to help urself?
2/7/16, 11:05 - Mom: be positive
2/7/16, 11:07 - Cindy L: What the fuck
2/7/16, 11:08 - Cindy L: Fuck off mopps, take ur hippism somewhere else
2/7/16, 11:09 - Cindy L: Being positive and not knowing how to use wikipedia helps nobody
2/7/16, 11:13 - Mom: how can u treat someone giving sincere advice like that?
2/7/16, 11:14 - Mom: just want ppl be apathetic or posting happy social events on the fb only?
2/7/16, 11:16 - Mom: u don't even understand how a mum having children in sickness feels?
2/7/16, 11:20 - Cindy L: Yea so act like a worried mom
2/7/16, 11:20 - Cindy L: Not a self help book
2/7/16, 11:21 - Cindy L: I actually don't want to see people post their happy social gatherings in fb
2/7/16, 11:23 - Cindy L: I can't care less if they're happier than I am.
2/7/16, 11:23 - Cindy L: Positive = the one thing I hate the most, ok
2/7/16, 11:24 - Cindy L: Because just being positive gets u nowhere, u gotta get off ur butt and do something abt it
2/7/16, 11:24 - Cindy L: So u should say we'll keep looking and researching
2/7/16, 11:24 - Cindy L: Not just be positive
2/7/16, 11:25 - Cindy L: Because hope is in the research
2/7/16, 11:25 - Cindy L: And needless to say, that is already innately a very positive as attitude to this whole snafu
2/7/16, 11:26 - Cindy L: So u telling me to be positive is just an insult to my core virtues.
2/7/16, 11:28 - Cindy L: Cuz I am very forward thinking.
2/7/16, 11:28 - Cindy L: So dw
2/7/16, 11:30 - Cindy L: I'll say thanks for your advice. But that's sort of what u ought to do unless u want to be a shitty parent as well.
2/7/16, 11:37 - Mom: if u think that good parents and every other things r take for granted, u wud be frustrated all the times
2/7/16, 11:37 - Mom: anyway, don't want to stick on these arguments any more
2/7/16, 11:41 - Cindy L: Good parents r not for granted. But that's what a good person should do.
2/7/16, 11:41 - Cindy L: Im a bad person so I guess that's why bad things happen to me
2/7/16, 11:45 - Mom: ü§ê
2/7/16, 11:46 - Cindy L: Can't see the emoji
2/7/16, 11:46 - Cindy L: Anyways u should do good things cuz I don't want bad things to happen to u too....
2/7/16, 11:46 - Mom: üò∂
2/7/16, 13:49 - Cindy L: Barry schwartz: "the secret to happiness is low expectations"
2/7/16, 13:49 - Cindy L: Hahahaha
2/7/16, 13:49 - Cindy L: That guy is hilarious
2/7/16, 15:14 - Mom: Do u still hv vitamin b supplement ?
2/7/16, 15:34 - Cindy L: Is this the cherry dtuff?
2/7/16, 15:34 - Cindy L: Stuff
2/7/16, 15:35 - Mom: No the vitamin b50 complex
2/7/16, 15:46 - Cindy L: No more lah
2/7/16, 15:47 - Mom: K
2/7/16, 18:26 - Mom: I shall buy theanine +  vitamin b as I've chk the price is cheaper from iherb
2/7/16, 18:26 - Mom: items wud be sent to ur dorm directly
2/7/16, 20:49 - Cindy L: Nooooo I already bought theanine
2/7/16, 20:51 - Cindy L: Can u get me phenibut if possible
2/7/16, 20:52 - Cindy L: It's Russian drug lol
2/7/16, 20:53 - Cindy L: So is picamilon
2/8/16, 00:02 - Mom: Errr
2/8/16, 00:53 - Mom: https://blog.priceplow.com/supplement-news/picamilon-fda
2/8/16, 00:53 - Mom: looks like that we can't buy product with picamilon
2/8/16, 01:21 - Mom: phenibut is a powerful drug (ppl commented) but easily tolerated and the withdrawal side effects r much more negative like: severe anxiety, nervousness, tremors, agitation, dizziness, irritation, fatigue, loss of appetite, rapid heartbeat, nausea, vomiting, tension, psychosis, hallucinations, and insomnia.  These symptoms may last as long as two weeks.
2/8/16, 01:22 - Mom: i think at this stage, u just try the theanine first to see if there's any effect on ur sleep qualtiy
2/8/16, 01:37 - Cindy L: Yeah but they just passed the psychoactive drugs act
2/8/16, 01:37 - Cindy L: And after April 1st u can't buy phenibut without a prescription anymore.
2/8/16, 01:37 - Cindy L: Possession is still legal
2/8/16, 01:38 - Cindy L: But I don't know if they will allow through custons
2/8/16, 01:38 - Cindy L: Customs
2/8/16, 01:38 - Cindy L: Plus phenibut is exactly like baclofen with less side effects.
2/8/16, 01:39 - Cindy L: Side effects r super minimal
2/8/16, 01:43 - Cindy L: I also found adrafinil
2/8/16, 01:43 - Cindy L: The precursor of modafinil
2/8/16, 01:46 - Mom: u mean in us or uk?
2/8/16, 01:47 - Mom: i didn't find any new prescription requirement for phenibut?
2/8/16, 01:48 - Mom: still some ppl experienced severe side effects like having vivid dream and horrible nightmare at the time of withdrawal
2/8/16, 06:12 - Cindy L: Uk
2/8/16, 06:12 - Cindy L: Nootropics r included under the psychoactive drugs act
2/8/16, 06:13 - Cindy L: Yea but all drugs hv withdrawal, even panadol has side effects
2/8/16, 06:14 - Cindy L: And the reported side effects were all people who didn't take it the right way, already had underlying alcohol dependency and such
2/8/16, 06:15 - Cindy L: I mean sure even the 5htp had weird dreams.
2/8/16, 06:16 - Cindy L: Anyways I already ordered the theanine off amazon
2/8/16, 06:17 - Cindy L: Oh right, yea since nootropics are included, the good sites hv stopped selling üòû
2/8/16, 06:24 - Cindy L: OK I see why u worry
2/8/16, 06:24 - Cindy L: Phenibut and baclofen both work similar to sodium oxybate
2/8/16, 06:26 - Cindy L: But u know people use it for cognitive enhancement, lol
2/8/16, 06:46 - Mom: ppl had it b4 said phenibut is a power drug but has low tolerance, that means it wud be easy to addict to it
2/8/16, 06:48 - Mom: oh the precursor of modafinil,  adrafinil, is unlikely to be purchased safely online as its original manufacturer had already ceased producing it and it's not probably regulated by us's FDA or uk's pharmacy authorities
2/8/16, 06:50 - Mom: http://www.pillscout.com/2014/09/16/can-still-buy-real-adrafinil-olmifon-online/
2/8/16, 06:51 - Cindy L: <Media omitted>
2/8/16, 06:51 - Cindy L: Ghb is sodium oxybate
2/8/16, 06:52 - Cindy L: Seems like baclofen is more effective as a narcoleptic drug, why do they prescribe sodium oxybate though?
2/8/16, 06:54 - Cindy L: Nevermind, forget abt adrafinil
2/8/16, 06:57 - Cindy L: Why did they hv to axe picamilon üò≠
2/8/16, 06:58 - Cindy L: It looked promising
2/8/16, 06:58 - Cindy L: I'm feeling the oppression from giant pharmaceuticals
2/8/16, 07:00 - Cindy L: Doctors just prescribe antidepressants to everybody cuz it makes them and the drug companies billions of dollars üò°
2/8/16, 07:01 - Cindy L: And it ends up frying everyone's brain. üò°üò°üò°
2/8/16, 07:03 - Cindy L: And gov bans me from essentially treating myself üò°üò°üò°üò°üí¢üí¢
2/8/16, 07:03 - Cindy L: This is just fantastic
2/8/16, 07:05 - Mom: this is politics and money ma
2/8/16, 07:08 - Cindy L: Yah
2/8/16, 07:08 - Cindy L: Fuck institutions
2/8/16, 07:10 - Mom: calm down la
2/8/16, 07:11 - Mom: is cny a holiday at lse/uk?
2/8/16, 07:13 - Mom: i'm a bit strange that theoretically after taking alcohol, ur muscles shud be relaxed instead of having strength? am i right in interpreting ur symptoms?
2/8/16, 08:15 - Cindy L: Not having strength
2/8/16, 08:15 - Cindy L: But less likely to induce weakness
2/8/16, 08:16 - Cindy L: My theory is that it basically acts like antiseizure meds
2/8/16, 08:17 - Cindy L: More gaba slows down communication in ur brain so faulty signals can't round the brain that quickly
2/8/16, 08:17 - Mom: alcohol is depressant and according to those dr's theory, to help control cataplexy they prescribe anti-depressant ---> ?
2/8/16, 08:18 - Mom: do u see my point?
2/8/16, 08:18 - Cindy L: No anti depressants is just a name
2/8/16, 08:18 - Cindy L: They don't hv opposite function
2/8/16, 08:19 - Cindy L: They are all anxiolytics
2/8/16, 08:20 - Cindy L: Basically works to reduce anxiety, just through different mechanisms
2/8/16, 08:21 - Cindy L: I did see the narco wiki page which says they suspect it maybe  hyperactivity in the gaba receptors which causes hypersomnolence
2/8/16, 08:21 - Cindy L: That's the only contradictory thing for me
2/8/16, 08:21 - Mom: err, alcohol as a depressant does makes ppl more depressed if consumer high volume
2/8/16, 08:22 - Cindy L: Depression as in physical or  the clinical?
2/8/16, 08:22 - Mom: clinical
2/8/16, 08:22 - Cindy L: That's different its a long term effect
2/8/16, 08:22 - Cindy L: And
2/8/16, 08:23 - Cindy L: People hv alcohol dependency because of depression
2/8/16, 08:23 - Cindy L: Not the other way round
2/8/16, 08:23 - Cindy L: Or at least thats not what 'depressant' refers to
2/8/16, 08:24 - Mom: alcohol dependency is physical dependent not psychological
2/8/16, 08:24 - Cindy L: Yea that's addiction
2/8/16, 08:24 - Cindy L: That's different from depression
2/8/16, 08:24 - Cindy L: But they r indeed correlated
2/8/16, 08:24 - Mom: so ur saying that "ppl hv alcohol dependency because of depression" shud be the other way round
2/8/16, 08:25 - Cindy L: I'm saying ppl drink because they r depresses
2/8/16, 08:25 - Cindy L: Depressed
2/8/16, 08:25 - Cindy L: But that's another issue altogether
2/8/16, 08:26 - Cindy L: It's called a 'depressant' cuz it slows down ur body's physiological functions
2/8/16, 08:26 - Cindy L: And that's because it increases gaba and gaba works to calm down the signals in ur brain
2/8/16, 08:27 - Cindy L: So everything works slower
2/8/16, 08:27 - Cindy L: Hence a 'depressing effect'
2/8/16, 08:27 - Mom: but is it the real situation applicable to ur case having taken alcohol?
2/8/16, 08:28 - Cindy L: Well in the case if alcohol, it would be like slurry speech and less motor control
2/8/16, 08:29 - Mom: u rlly have it?
2/8/16, 08:29 - Cindy L: For me, I hv high tolerance so I get a buzz
2/8/16, 08:29 - Cindy L: No I don't get slurry speech and lose motor control
2/8/16, 08:29 - Cindy L: That is for completely drunk people
2/8/16, 08:30 - Cindy L: That's when u hv a lot of gaba
2/8/16, 08:31 - Cindy L: I think for me, gaba uptake increases enough just to quarantine the faulty signals
2/8/16, 08:31 - Mom: how can u be so sure that u hv high tolerance? as far as i know, me & ur dad, ur grandpas and grandmas all don't drink alcohol alot
2/8/16, 08:31 - Cindy L: Well maybe I hv normal tolerance
2/8/16, 08:32 - Cindy L: But I hv higher tolerance than all the other girls here
2/8/16, 08:32 - Cindy L: For some strange reason
2/8/16, 08:32 - Cindy L: I seem to metabolise it much quicker
2/8/16, 08:33 - Mom: no, i rather thought it's ur liver function doing a gd job
2/8/16, 08:33 - Cindy L: Though it maybe that I have larger body mass? Since how much u can drink is related to body mass anyways.
2/8/16, 08:33 - Mom: cuz ur face easily turn red after alcohol
2/8/16, 08:33 - Cindy L: That's a different thing
2/8/16, 08:33 - Cindy L: That's Asian flush
2/8/16, 08:34 - Cindy L: It's cuz asians have a gene which makes us lack a type of enzyme
2/8/16, 08:34 - Cindy L: .... wait.
2/8/16, 08:34 - Cindy L: That substance which causes the flush increases histamine.
2/8/16, 08:34 - Cindy L: üòï
2/8/16, 08:34 - Cindy L: Hmmm
2/8/16, 08:35 - Mom: do u feel more itchy after drinking?
2/8/16, 08:35 - Cindy L: No u turn red
2/8/16, 08:35 - Cindy L: I turn red
2/8/16, 08:35 - Cindy L: Cuz of the histamine
2/8/16, 08:35 - Mom: but histamine wud make u feel very itchy
2/8/16, 08:35 - Cindy L: Is it histamine effect?
2/8/16, 08:36 - Cindy L: Sometimes itchy
2/8/16, 08:36 - Cindy L: Last time I went to lkf I was itchy after
2/8/16, 08:37 - Cindy L: So now u mention it, do u think it may be effect of the histamine? And not gaba?
2/8/16, 08:37 - Mom: yea, histamine makes ppl awake and also cause allergic response
2/8/16, 08:37 - Cindy L: But it supresses the cataplexy
2/8/16, 08:38 - Cindy L: No I actually yawn a lot after the alcohol metabolizes
2/8/16, 08:38 - Mom: that's why i ask ur physical response so detail and repeatedly
2/8/16, 08:38 - Cindy L: Ok
2/8/16, 08:39 - Cindy L: But eczema is h4 receptor
2/8/16, 08:39 - Cindy L: So this may be different ones.
2/8/16, 08:39 - Cindy L: There r narco drugs which target histamine
2/8/16, 08:40 - Mom: but u did say ur more alert after drinking right?
2/8/16, 08:40 - Cindy L: Hmmm yea sort of
2/8/16, 08:40 - Cindy L: My hr goes up
2/8/16, 08:40 - Cindy L: I get red flush
2/8/16, 08:41 - Cindy L: And even if I feel happy, I don't experience as much weakness
2/8/16, 08:41 - Cindy L: It doesn't completely suppress it
2/8/16, 08:41 - Cindy L: I also hv less anxiety
2/8/16, 08:42 - Cindy L: When I drink
2/8/16, 08:42 - Mom: that's strange, ur hr goes up but u yawn alot?
2/8/16, 08:42 - Cindy L: No-no yawning is afterwards
2/8/16, 08:42 - Cindy L: U know when ur sober
2/8/16, 08:42 - Cindy L: And tired and u go to bed.
2/8/16, 08:43 - Cindy L: Like hr increase and flush is initial reaction
2/8/16, 08:43 - Mom: less anxiety also strange, if according to what wiki says, u shud hv more anxiety after drinking
2/8/16, 08:43 - Cindy L: No less, alcohol has calming effect
2/8/16, 08:43 - Cindy L: People drink to forget and relax
2/8/16, 08:43 - Cindy L: They wouldn't drink to be more anxious
2/8/16, 08:44 - Cindy L: That's why I talk more when drunk
2/8/16, 08:45 - Cindy L: Though the histamine is interesting
2/8/16, 08:45 - Cindy L: I may do some research there
2/8/16, 08:45 - Mom: "People drink to forget and relax" -- this is only ppl's own initial intention but in reality and physiological-wise, the opposite results
2/8/16, 08:45 - Mom: trust me, i've friends drinking to that level
2/8/16, 08:46 - Cindy L: Yea but the psychological stuff is long term effects
2/8/16, 08:46 - Cindy L: I'm talking abt immediate physical responses here
2/8/16, 08:46 - Mom: not "psychological", its physio
2/8/16, 08:47 - Mom: ok, don't go on with this point cuz u rlly hv a different response
2/8/16, 08:47 - Mom: just mark it down
2/8/16, 08:48 - Cindy L: üòë dude I'm telling u ur confusing long term and short term effects
2/8/16, 08:48 - Cindy L: But nvm
2/8/16, 11:11 - Cindy L: guy on phenibut
2/8/16, 11:11 - Cindy L: I tried it yesterday, but I also got into the first day of aniracetam so take this with a pinch of salt. Took 600mg, didn't notice anything. A coupld of hours later took another 600mgs and went shopping. I didn't feel at all intoxicated but I did feel quite confident and upbeat. Got home a couple of hours after that and went for a short run. I noticed no problems with coordination, and music appreciation was increased, as I found myself listening to the parts of the sound I'd usually ignore. I managed a couple of hours of study after this. Then I took about another gram and went to see girlfriend. I still didn't feel intoxicated but was very relaxed. I ate more than would do usually, couldn't stop. Watching tv I could barely stay awake, and this was between 8pm and midnight, I was continually waking up and falling back asleep every half hour. Then in bed I slept like the dead and had some very weird deep dreams that felt very real.
2/8/16, 11:19 - Cindy L: also i feel like my memory is seriously having problems
2/8/16, 11:20 - Cindy L: i can't recall shit, esp names
2/8/16, 11:32 - Mom: this is somebody on reddit?
2/8/16, 11:32 - Cindy L: no u know those drug experimentation forums
2/8/16, 11:32 - Cindy L: some ppl do this for a living
2/8/16, 11:33 - Mom: apparently he had too much of the drug and being toxicated
2/8/16, 11:33 - Cindy L: they use as recreational btw
2/8/16, 11:33 - Cindy L: so dosage is a bit higher
2/8/16, 11:33 - Mom: i wonder his brain cells wud hv damage if he's going to continue that kind of drugs
2/8/16, 11:34 - Cindy L: u can't take it everyday.
2/8/16, 11:34 - Cindy L: only like 2 or 3 times a week
2/8/16, 11:34 - Cindy L: cuz u will develop tolerance really quickly
2/8/16, 11:34 - Mom: notice that he couldn't rmb things, which means he might hv cognitive impairment
2/8/16, 11:35 - Cindy L: yea he took three doses in a day.
2/8/16, 11:35 - Mom: yea, as i said phenibut has low tolerance
2/8/16, 11:35 - Cindy L: normal medication dosage would be 500mg a day.
2/8/16, 11:35 - Cindy L: that guy took 2.1 g
2/8/16, 11:35 - Cindy L: of that stuff.
2/8/16, 11:35 - Cindy L: in a day.
2/8/16, 11:36 - Cindy L: but just for ref, that's the worse thing that could happen.
2/8/16, 11:36 - Mom: but ppl usually don't recognise they overdose until something weird happen
2/8/16, 11:36 - Mom: no, also severe seizure
2/8/16, 11:36 - Mom: i read from blog
2/8/16, 11:36 - Cindy L: bloggers are also rec
2/8/16, 11:37 - Cindy L: if u stick to 500mg dosage i think it should be fine
2/8/16, 11:37 - Mom: withdrawal cause severe seizure, which means patient has no way to quit
2/8/16, 11:37 - Cindy L: i mean these people take it deliberately to get high
2/8/16, 11:37 - Cindy L: that's why they take so much
2/8/16, 11:38 - Cindy L: yeah withdrawl can cause seizure, but this is withdrawl from VERY HIGH AMOUNTS.
2/8/16, 11:38 - Cindy L: like these people.
2/8/16, 11:38 - Mom: no, i read that ppl having severe seizures on withdrawal of phenibut and then they had to use it again to overcome those seizures, the girl is on normal consumption
2/8/16, 11:39 - Cindy L: what dosage?
2/8/16, 11:39 - Mom: and some hv weird vivid dreams, nightmares like those of urs
2/8/16, 11:39 - Mom: can't rmb, i read from a mum's blog
2/8/16, 11:39 - Cindy L: anyone taking phenibut is not on normal dosage.
2/8/16, 11:39 - Cindy L: it's mostly junkies or people who experiment with nootropics.
2/8/16, 11:40 - Mom: no, u can't deny side effects even on normal consumption rate
2/8/16, 11:40 - Cindy L: k
2/8/16, 11:40 - Mom: ofc some just didn't hv any side effects
2/8/16, 11:40 - Cindy L: for this one, i think its a small risk
2/8/16, 11:41 - Cindy L: i mean it used to be a dietary supplement -.-
2/8/16, 11:41 - Cindy L: its like being afraid of konjac or vitamin C
2/8/16, 11:41 - Cindy L: of course taking too many vitamins will also give u side effects.
2/8/16, 11:42 - Mom: the worst scenario wud be decreased hr, difficulty breathing like dead
2/8/16, 11:42 - Cindy L: if i was allergic to gaba, 1. i'd have seizures all the time, 2. i wouldn't be able to drink alcohol
2/8/16, 11:43 - Cindy L: so considering my reactions to alcohol, i think risk of side effects are low.
2/8/16, 11:43 - Cindy L: i mean they both work based on teh same mechanism
2/8/16, 11:44 - Mom: gaba is naturally produced in ur brain, not from synthesis and can't be brought into ur brain through normal oral consumption
2/8/16, 11:44 - Mom: so u can't be allergic to gaba
2/8/16, 11:44 - Cindy L: yeah
2/8/16, 11:44 - Cindy L: exactly.
2/8/16, 11:44 - Cindy L: that's why im saying the risk is lo
2/8/16, 11:44 - Mom: alcohol can pass through bbb, therefore it can affect ur gaba level
2/8/16, 11:45 - Cindy L: yeah
2/8/16, 11:45 - Cindy L: good job. so can phenibut.
2/8/16, 11:45 - Mom: but phenibut affects ur liver functions seriously
2/8/16, 11:47 - Cindy L: yeah so does alcohol
2/8/16, 11:47 - Mom: rmb the 5htp? do u think ur going to take it?
2/8/16, 11:47 - Cindy L: the 5htp?
2/8/16, 11:47 - Cindy L: it wasn't that bad, just didn't work
2/8/16, 11:47 - Mom: u had those vivid dreams and nightmares?
2/8/16, 11:48 - Cindy L: i just had crazy dreams
2/8/16, 11:48 - Cindy L: no nightmare
2/8/16, 11:48 - Cindy L: i actually might try them again to properly observe effects
2/8/16, 11:48 - Mom: phenibut is said to hv those kinds of dreams hving taken it
2/8/16, 11:48 - Cindy L: that's normal for me then, cuz i always have crazy dreams
2/8/16, 11:49 - Cindy L: the worse dreams is when i'm sleep deprived and i nap in the afternoon. u get pretty vivid dream and then the sleep paralysis makes it worse.
2/8/16, 11:49 - Cindy L: very disorienting
2/8/16, 11:51 - Mom: i mean those drugs r suppose to help relax ur brain and lower its firing time and rate, but then they still produce sort of crazy dreams as side effect, so r they actually working to calm ur brain down?
2/8/16, 11:51 - Mom: this is my Q?
2/8/16, 11:52 - Cindy L: physically it is.
2/8/16, 11:52 - Mom: rlly? i don't know
2/8/16, 11:52 - Cindy L: u have to understand that some words have both solid, objective definitions
2/8/16, 11:53 - Cindy L: and can also be understood in different ways
2/8/16, 11:53 - Cindy L: when i say relax, i only mean in the scientific sense
2/8/16, 11:53 - Mom: ofc la, but ur the one who is going to take all the risk, so u hv to be very careful
2/8/16, 11:53 - Cindy L: we don't even know if having dreams == brain in a relaxing stage or not
2/8/16, 11:53 - Mom: ofc not la
2/8/16, 11:54 - Cindy L: k
2/8/16, 11:54 - Mom: if it is, then rem sleep wud be refreshing
2/8/16, 11:54 - Cindy L: i just need to keep up with the observation logging
2/8/16, 11:54 - Cindy L: yeah but ur brain does it while u sleep
2/8/16, 11:54 - Cindy L: must do it for a reason
2/8/16, 11:54 - Cindy L: and long term memory is dealt with in sws
2/8/16, 11:55 - Cindy L: so dreams can't be to do with memory then.
2/8/16, 11:55 - Mom: did u know that when u dream, u brain won't show sws
2/8/16, 11:55 - Cindy L: yeah
2/8/16, 11:55 - Cindy L: i know
2/8/16, 11:55 - Mom: the electrical impulse is like awake status
2/8/16, 11:56 - Cindy L: yes
2/8/16, 11:56 - Cindy L: that is true
2/8/16, 11:56 - Cindy L: theta waves
2/8/16, 11:56 - Mom: then, u can't hv rest if ur hving too much dreams
2/8/16, 11:56 - Cindy L: but what do you mean by rest first?
2/8/16, 11:57 - Mom: u know, the resting period is important for ur brain to repair tissues and whatever inside ur brain
2/8/16, 11:59 - Cindy L: ?
2/8/16, 11:59 - Mom: the prob with narcoleptics is that their brain fires too much that they look for resting period all the time, i think
2/8/16, 12:00 - Cindy L: ok
2/8/16, 12:00 - Cindy L: so by rest, we define as period of sws
2/8/16, 12:00 - Mom: yea
2/8/16, 12:00 - Cindy L: just call it sws then, its more clear to understand
2/8/16, 12:00 - Cindy L: ok i see what u mean now
2/8/16, 12:00 - Mom: so even if u nap at daytime,  it won't be refreshing cuz no sws
2/8/16, 12:01 - Cindy L: how can baclofen improve sleep if it causes weirder dreams?
2/8/16, 12:01 - Cindy L: right?
2/8/16, 12:01 - Cindy L: well i'm treating the muscle problem and the sleep problem separately
2/8/16, 12:02 - Cindy L: so if it works to suppress the muscle disorder, it's good for me
2/8/16, 12:02 - Cindy L: not so sure of effects on sleep, cuz people don't usually report their observations in that area in enough detail
2/8/16, 12:02 - Mom: hving weird dreams mean ur emotions/psycho area is affected, we don't know if that drug brings in more dream time of just the content?
2/8/16, 12:02 - Cindy L: so i'll probably try the 5ht again to see
2/8/16, 12:03 - Cindy L: i don't think u rem more, it's just that the rem content is more vivid
2/8/16, 12:03 - Cindy L: by more vivid, as in the content involves more sensory content
2/8/16, 12:04 - Cindy L: in fact, vivid dreams are not per say, like real
2/8/16, 12:04 - Mom: i can't still figure out the relationship between muscles weakness and the triggering event, therefore....
2/8/16, 12:04 - Cindy L: they are like more than real
2/8/16, 12:04 - Cindy L: yeah we still haven't figured out the muscle weakness mechanism
2/8/16, 12:04 - Mom: that means those drug affects ur sensory acceptors more
2/8/16, 12:05 - Cindy L: not exactly.
2/8/16, 12:05 - Mom: that's why the dreams r so vivid and real
2/8/16, 12:05 - Cindy L: hahaha its not that simple
2/8/16, 12:05 - Mom: ofc we don't know the exact mechanism, just reasoning
2/8/16, 12:06 - Cindy L: like simply why do u feel fear in ur dream more intensely?
2/8/16, 12:06 - Cindy L: i alreaddy don't know the answer to that
2/8/16, 12:07 - Mom: but i do think that those dreams r sort of psychological effects on human brain and that always might lead to mental issue if not treated in the long run
2/8/16, 12:07 - Cindy L: it's like when u're dreaming your cognitive capabilities shut down and only the emotive capabilities are left.
2/8/16, 12:07 - Cindy L: somehow u can still understand everything with only emotions
2/8/16, 12:07 - Cindy L: its a very weird feeling.
2/8/16, 12:08 - Cindy L: but as soon as u begin to reason and think logically about the dream, it doesn't make sense
2/8/16, 12:08 - Cindy L: i think it has more to do with the instinctive dream
2/8/16, 12:09 - Cindy L: brain, not dream
2/8/16, 12:09 - Cindy L: cuz if u think about it, the instinctive brain won't turn off right?
2/8/16, 12:09 - Cindy L: thats why everything is linked to the amygdala
2/8/16, 12:10 - Cindy L: so emotions must come from the instinctive brain,
2/8/16, 12:11 - Cindy L: humans must hv developed reasoning afterwards during evolutionary process
2/8/16, 12:15 - Mom: hmmm, reasoning is processed at the front cortex which exists simultaneously with the back of the brain, as i understand
2/8/16, 12:40 - Cindy L: but the limbic system sits mostly deep inside the brain
2/9/16, 10:54 - Cindy L: Oh my god
2/9/16, 10:54 - Cindy L: U thought the Chinese were good at chemistry
2/9/16, 10:55 - Cindy L: The Russians are literally masters of it
2/9/16, 11:11 - Mom: u see lots of drugs in russian website?
2/9/16, 11:11 - Mom: i think it shud be the communists r gd at chemistry
2/9/16, 13:02 - Cindy L: Yea those smart drugs are mostly russian
2/9/16, 13:03 - Cindy L: Yea for some strange reason commies r really freaking good at chem
2/9/16, 13:03 - Cindy L: Maybe its the way how scientific research is organised internally.
2/9/16, 13:04 - Cindy L: I found this one called
2/9/16, 13:05 - Cindy L: Bromantanr
2/9/16, 13:05 - Cindy L: Bromantane
2/9/16, 13:05 - Cindy L: It sounds awesome.
2/9/16, 13:05 - Cindy L: It's a stimulant but also calms u down.
2/9/16, 13:06 - Mom: how did u find it?
2/9/16, 13:10 - Cindy L: I was looking at suppliers
2/9/16, 13:10 - Cindy L: And just happened to Google this one
2/9/16, 13:10 - Cindy L: But its out of stock
2/9/16, 13:10 - Cindy L: Dw
2/9/16, 13:13 - Cindy L: Just saw the HK police thing
2/9/16, 13:13 - Cindy L: I'm amazed at how many people decided to write whole epics on fb about this.
2/9/16, 13:14 - Mom: how did ppl comment on that incident?
2/9/16, 13:40 - Mom: don't try to find so many psycho drugs which r used to promote athlete's short term performance that i don't think is applicable in ur case
2/9/16, 13:41 - Mom: moreover, u've no knowledge abt its long term side effects on ur body
2/9/16, 13:43 - Mom: why those drugs popular in russian? bc athletes need to achieve gd result on international competitions
2/9/16, 13:44 - Mom: sometimes they're forced to use these drugs despite these drugs do have detrimental effects on their body
2/9/16, 13:44 - Mom: think it twice, thrice and....
2/9/16, 13:45 - Mom: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12124651
2/9/16, 13:50 - Mom: what did u buy from thoughtfoods.com?
2/9/16, 13:52 - Mom: it's not safe to buy those psychiatric drugs online: qualities and the probable side effects
2/9/16, 13:53 - Mom: u can just risk ur health to make it deteriorate than improving it
2/9/16, 13:53 - Mom: please
2/9/16, 14:11 - Mom: cindy, i seriously asked u not to use those psychiatric drugs u bought/intend to buy online:
2/9/16, 14:14 - Mom: 1)  ur not accompanied by a family mbr/close friend who might be able to notice ur adverse/harmful reaction to these drugs taken, when u exhibit any serious allergic reaction, nobody wud provide help immediately
2/9/16, 14:15 - Mom: 2)  it's not cost-benefit justifiable to try those drugs on unknown side effects data
2/9/16, 14:18 - Mom: 3) u never know whether those drugs wud bring in more brain damages or not, be it in short term or in the long run
2/9/16, 14:19 - Mom: 4) i advise u to do more meditation/yoga/qi gong to help calm ur mind down instead of trying these drugs cuz those exercise didn't do any harm to ur body and u knew it
2/9/16, 14:21 - Mom: 5) do u rmb the ivig experience? u rlly want ot risk ur health on unknown benefits?
2/9/16, 14:23 - Mom: 6) i do belief those smart drugs can help some sort of temporary alertness/sporty achievement, but i also trust that they do bring in some degree of damages to ppl's brain cell/liver function
2/9/16, 14:24 - Mom: 7) why not concentrate on doing transfer to ucl/us uni?
2/9/16, 14:25 - Mom: if u do want those drugs, i wud recommend u to go see a physican and ask for them bc u can have somebody to look after ur drug reaction and be responsible for the drugs' safety
2/9/16, 14:39 - Cindy L: I got a tester for phenibut
2/9/16, 14:39 - Cindy L: and picalimon. That's just it
2/9/16, 14:39 - Mom: i suggest not to take them
2/9/16, 14:39 - Cindy L: There's only a few capsules
2/9/16, 14:40 - Cindy L: The l theanine didn't really do anything.
2/9/16, 14:40 - Cindy L: I even spilt my tea when I was talking to someone yesterday
2/9/16, 14:40 - Cindy L: I might as well live on the floor these days
2/9/16, 14:41 - Mom: no, i understand that u've bought Adrafinil
2/9/16, 14:42 - Mom: why try something which even the original manufacturer had already ceased to produce?
2/9/16, 14:43 - Cindy L: It's produced in Latvia under olmifon now...
2/9/16, 14:44 - Mom: if ur situation is worse like that, i suggest u suspend ur studies and come back hk for medical treatment
2/9/16, 14:44 - Cindy L: What treatment? Ritalin and effexor again?
2/9/16, 14:44 - Cindy L: Hahaha
2/9/16, 14:45 - Mom: then see doctors at nhs
2/9/16, 14:45 - Cindy L: Doctors only prescribe u what the pharmaceuticals produce cuz they make money
2/9/16, 14:47 - Mom: so those co selling drugs online even without licence are trying to help ppl?
2/9/16, 14:47 - Cindy L: come on, they have just started accepting sodium oxybate
2/9/16, 14:47 - Cindy L: and that paper i showed u
2/9/16, 14:47 - Cindy L: research already shows that r baclofen is the superior drug
2/9/16, 14:47 - Mom: how do u test whether they're selling genuine drugs?
2/9/16, 14:47 - Cindy L: independent testing. =.=
2/9/16, 14:48 - Cindy L: u only buy from those with independent testing.
2/9/16, 14:49 - Cindy L: and seriously in the 21st century, medicine should be open source.
2/9/16, 14:49 - Mom: have u asked those online co to show u actual independent testing report b4 ordering?
2/9/16, 14:49 - Cindy L: that's why i'm ordering a tester?
2/9/16, 14:49 - Mom: open source doesn't mean risky taking
2/9/16, 14:49 - Cindy L: this is not risky taking
2/9/16, 14:50 - Cindy L: i've literally spent the last few days researching this stuff.
2/9/16, 14:50 - Mom: u can only tell after the result, whether risk taking or not
2/9/16, 14:50 - Cindy L: u won't die from one dose....
2/9/16, 14:50 - Cindy L: i didn't even die from the ivig
2/9/16, 14:51 - Cindy L: honestly.
2/9/16, 14:51 - Mom: u think ur superwoman, spent just couple of days and find a solution to a weird disorder?
2/9/16, 14:51 - Cindy L: no
2/9/16, 14:51 - Cindy L: but if u just stand there doing nothing, i am going to have to live on the floor soon
2/9/16, 14:52 - Cindy L: i'm gonna be a snake
2/9/16, 14:52 - Cindy L: or a slug
2/9/16, 14:52 - Cindy L: that's worse
2/9/16, 14:53 - Cindy L: i wanna be a fish
2/9/16, 14:53 - Cindy L: lol
2/9/16, 14:54 - Mom: i can understand why ur symptoms is getting worse so quickly in uk? theoretically that disorder will not be getting worse once in place and the cataplexy is said wud be lessen over time, according to the research report
2/9/16, 14:54 - Mom: *i can't understand
2/9/16, 14:54 - Cindy L: my symptoms have not gotten worse
2/9/16, 14:54 - Cindy L: or better
2/9/16, 14:54 - Cindy L: i have been logging everything.
2/9/16, 14:55 - Cindy L: and there has been no change
2/9/16, 14:55 - Cindy L: plus cataplexy improves over a duration of years, not months according to the reports.
2/9/16, 14:55 - Mom: so u shudn't have to live on the floor!
2/9/16, 14:56 - Cindy L: so u mean i go back to being anti-social
2/9/16, 14:56 - Cindy L: either i be a friendly snake
2/9/16, 14:56 - Cindy L: or i be a hermit.
2/9/16, 14:56 - Cindy L: lol what a choice
2/9/16, 15:03 - Mom: seriously, i can do nothing to decide for ur life
2/9/16, 15:03 - Mom: all i can do is to remind u of the possible risk and cost associated with ur decisions
2/9/16, 15:05 - Cindy L: Yea I know
2/9/16, 15:05 - Cindy L: Hence a tester.
2/9/16, 15:05 - Cindy L: Or else I wouldn't even do all that research
2/9/16, 15:05 - Mom: ur the one to bear all the possible effects and results, so think twice, thrice and forth times....before deciding
2/9/16, 15:06 - Cindy L: People take mdma and still don't die =.=
2/9/16, 15:07 - Cindy L: And they hv to take it a lot to fuck up their brains
2/9/16, 15:07 - Mom: yea, some ppl got shot and even survive
2/9/16, 15:08 - Cindy L: Yah see
2/9/16, 15:20 - Mom: <Media omitted>
2/9/16, 15:19 - Mom: https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/3u1e36/is_thoughtfoodscouk_a_safe_supplier_for_nootropics/
2/9/16, 15:19 - Mom: hv u read these comment
2/9/16, 15:21 - Mom: this is the response to my live chat request for an independent laboratory testing from thoughtfoods.com
2/9/16, 15:22 - Mom: wish them do give me a reply asap!
2/9/16, 16:48 - Cindy L: send them an email.
2/9/16, 16:48 - Cindy L: lol
2/9/16, 16:50 - Mom: don't want to bother, i suggest live chat is the most convenient and immediate way to get a reply, but it seems....
2/9/16, 19:25 - Cindy L: Hmm
2/9/16, 23:35 - Mom: ur disorder now can be seen as a matter of accident/bad luck, but if u take psycho drugs recklessly  which leads to irreversible result, u wont be feeling gd and this experience wud stay with for long long time
2/9/16, 23:50 - Mom: http://www.bizapedia.com/ca/GENEGAUGE-LABS-LLC.html
2/10/16, 00:16 - Cindy L: Sure sure
2/10/16, 00:16 - Cindy L: What do u suggest
2/10/16, 00:16 - Cindy L: Im already out of ideas
2/10/16, 00:16 - Cindy L: I don't know what to do anymore.
2/10/16, 00:17 - Cindy L: About this.
2/10/16, 00:18 - Cindy L: About everything
2/10/16, 00:20 - Cindy L: What is the link u sent btw?
2/10/16, 01:43 - Mom: The link is abt the company background of the online website "thoughtfoods"
2/10/16, 01:45 - Mom: Keep a log of ur symptoms
2/10/16, 01:46 - Mom: Try that theanine for some times first like a month or two weeks
2/10/16, 05:20 - Mom: our primary objective is to keep ur disorder not getting worse now
2/10/16, 05:21 - Mom: we all know that this disorder is rlly difficult to deal with especially the muscles atonia prob
2/10/16, 05:24 - Mom: i rmb that i've read something abt the sleeping pattern similar to ur situation saying that ritalin is no use in ur case but rather might be a relation to histamine, i'm now going back to my bookmarks to see if i can get that passage
2/10/16, 09:56 - Cindy L: My friend has social anxiety and she got concerts/ ritalin
2/10/16, 09:56 - Cindy L: During exam period
2/10/16, 09:56 - Mom: does it help?
2/10/16, 09:57 - Cindy L: Apparently she 'brightened' up
2/10/16, 09:57 - Cindy L: But the psychologist diagnosed her as add
2/10/16, 09:57 - Mom: ib friend?
2/10/16, 09:57 - Cindy L: Y
2/10/16, 09:58 - Cindy L: So far the theanine has not been working.
2/10/16, 09:58 - Mom: she's having a different illness other than urs, difficult to compare
2/10/16, 09:58 - Mom: got it already?
2/10/16, 09:58 - Cindy L: and I checked that it's theanine cuz it has the umami taste
2/10/16, 09:59 - Mom: how many days u've taken?
2/10/16, 09:59 - Cindy L: One
2/10/16, 09:59 - Cindy L: Doesn't affect mood
2/10/16, 10:00 - Cindy L: Didn't really feel anything.
2/10/16, 10:00 - Cindy L: People take with caffeine. But u know caffeine doesn't work on me either.
2/10/16, 10:01 - Mom: caffeine is stimulant and theanine is depressant, how come to take them together?
2/10/16, 10:02 - Cindy L: Theanine calms down the jitters helps focus
2/10/16, 10:02 - Cindy L: Caffeine makes motivated to do stuff
2/10/16, 10:02 - Cindy L: They work on different mechanisms
2/10/16, 10:02 - Mom: but shudn't u take the theanine b4 sleep?
2/10/16, 10:02 - Cindy L: No
2/10/16, 10:02 - Cindy L: It's not drowsy
2/10/16, 10:03 - Cindy L: And it doesn't effect sleep
2/10/16, 10:03 - Cindy L: It's just an anxiolytic as in it calms down ur brain cells, reduce anxiety
2/10/16, 10:03 - Mom: i know but it's supposed to slow down ur brain activities, so it's better to take them b4 sleep
2/10/16, 10:03 - Cindy L: I mean it's in bloody green tea
2/10/16, 10:04 - Cindy L: Japanese people drink that shit all day
2/10/16, 10:05 - Mom: they're not psychotic drugs, u can't expect immediate prominent effect
2/10/16, 10:05 - Mom: and ritalin also didn't seem work to improve ur eds
2/10/16, 10:05 - Cindy L: It technically is, its a gaba agonist.
2/10/16, 10:06 - Cindy L: That's why I've been telling u that all the stuff I hv been buying are literally supplements because they aren't as strong as the real thing.
2/10/16, 10:06 - Cindy L: In most cases they probably won't even work.
2/10/16, 10:07 - Mom: as i said, those smart drugs r for short term use like exam/competition period, u can't rely on them persistently
2/10/16, 10:08 - Cindy L: That's true
2/10/16, 10:08 - Cindy L: But if they work, its worth having a few pills around like an inhaler.
2/10/16, 10:10 - Cindy L: Btw I looked at all the ucl engineering courses
2/10/16, 10:10 - Cindy L: It's actually not bad they let u choose a major and minor
2/10/16, 10:10 - Mom: no, ur disorder now is a continuing event, not just illness once or twice
2/10/16, 10:11 - Cindy L: I can apply medical engineering.
2/10/16, 10:11 - Cindy L: Or biotech whatever they call it.
2/10/16, 10:11 - Mom: how many can u tolerate after having repeated incidents of eds/muscles atonia?
2/10/16, 10:12 - Cindy L: Tolerate what?
2/10/16, 10:12 - Mom: med engineering?
2/10/16, 10:12 - Mom: those drugs
2/10/16, 10:12 - Cindy L: Yea u build prosthetics and stuff
2/10/16, 10:12 - Cindy L: But the question is how to apply for that with my PS...
2/10/16, 10:12 - Cindy L: Why so annoying
2/10/16, 10:13 - Mom: can u ask for a separate ps?
2/10/16, 10:13 - Cindy L: Should I try to ask external transfer and then ask for different application?
2/10/16, 10:14 - Cindy L: Hai
2/10/16, 10:14 - Cindy L: My chance to get back into med.
2/10/16, 10:15 - Mom: can u try internal transfer between uol?
2/10/16, 10:15 - Cindy L: Though if I became an MD, I'd probably cry all day.
2/10/16, 10:15 - Cindy L: I can try
2/10/16, 10:16 - Mom: MD? cry?
2/10/16, 10:16 - Cindy L: Cuz hospital are sad places
2/10/16, 10:16 - Mom: ahhhh
2/10/16, 10:16 - Cindy L: It's worse than going to a cemetry
2/10/16, 10:16 - Cindy L: Cemetery
2/10/16, 10:17 - Mom: yea, being a doctor has to be apathetic
2/10/16, 10:19 - Mom: http://mentalhealthdaily.com/2015/03/30/8-ways-to-increase-bdnf-levels-brain-derived-neurotrophic-factor/
2/10/16, 10:19 - Mom: read this link, see if that wud be an explanation for ur disorder?
2/10/16, 10:54 - Cindy L: Nah not really.
2/10/16, 10:57 - Mom: but see the recommended treatments like taking antidepressants ssri?  if this is totally irrelevant, then i srly doubt whether ssri wud indeed treat muscles atonia?
2/10/16, 11:11 - Cindy L: They prescribe SSRIs for everything!
2/10/16, 11:12 - Cindy L: Cuz its easy, one drug one solution
2/10/16, 11:13 - Mom: then u still hope that ssri can treat cataplexy?
2/10/16, 11:13 - Mom: hahaha
2/10/16, 11:16 - Cindy L: better than nothing.
2/10/16, 11:16 - Cindy L: do u understand the feeling of hopelessness
2/10/16, 11:17 - Cindy L: i may as well sit in my room for the rest of eternity
2/10/16, 11:18 - Cindy L: so apparently columbia and lse are strategic partners
2/10/16, 11:18 - Cindy L: üòèüòè
2/10/16, 11:18 - Mom: i'm just saying perhaps we shud look for other direction instead of just ssri
2/10/16, 11:18 - Cindy L: i am
2/10/16, 11:18 - Cindy L: i'm testing all the neurotransmitters.
2/10/16, 11:20 - Mom: the prob is u can't test all the neurotransmitters blindly, we've to look for similar symptoms and do the research and its recommendations
2/10/16, 11:20 - Mom: so what's the benefit of strategic partners?
2/10/16, 11:21 - Mom: and bear in mind that for each trial of drugs, it takes time to see the effects and the time needed may be months or even longer
2/10/16, 11:28 - Cindy L: i dunno, maybe easier transfers?
2/10/16, 11:28 - Cindy L: hey they accepted me once already!
2/10/16, 11:29 - Mom: u can try anyway
2/10/16, 11:29 - Cindy L: <Media omitted>
2/10/16, 11:29 - Mom: and i think being a student at lse do hv benefit on asking transfer

2/15/16, 11:06 - Cindy L: Germans didn't want to talk to me. Lol
2/15/16, 11:06 - Emos: r they really cool
2/15/16, 11:06 - Cindy L: Sort of.
2/15/16, 11:07 - Cindy L: They r just like German speaking white ppl. ..
2/15/16, 11:07 - Emos: hah
2/15/16, 11:07 - Emos: german people r white people
2/15/16, 11:07 - Cindy L: East Berlin is more interesting though
2/15/16, 11:08 - Emos: i dont rmb any histroy which side is which
2/15/16, 11:08 - Cindy L: West is the one us poured money into
2/15/16, 11:08 - Cindy L: Easy is the Soviet side
2/15/16, 11:08 - Cindy L: East
2/15/16, 11:08 - Emos: ah right
2/15/16, 11:08 - Cindy L: So naturally east side is poorer
2/15/16, 11:08 - Cindy L: And more ghetto-y
2/15/16, 11:09 - Emos: still?
2/15/16, 11:09 - Cindy L: Yea its like east london

2/15/16, 11:10 - Cindy L: Shamshuipo
2/15/16, 11:10 - Cindy L: In the London the east west divide is really prominent
2/15/16, 11:10 - Emos: i thought only black americans live in ghettos
2/15/16, 11:10 - Cindy L: No
2/15/16, 11:11 - Cindy L: Ghetto just means where minorities live.
2/15/16, 11:11 - Cindy L: Like u can hv a Jewish ghetto
2/15/16, 11:11 - Emos: is it slum -my
2/15/16, 11:11 - Cindy L: Sort of
2/15/16, 11:11 - Cindy L: As slummy yeah
2/15/16, 11:11 - Emos: mmm im google it
2/15/16, 11:12 - Cindy L: Or like just a lot of poor people live in those places.
2/15/16, 11:12 - Cindy L: And u tend to get higher crime rate
2/15/16, 11:12 - Cindy L: Like east London
2/15/16, 11:12 - Cindy L: On the opposite, south k is in the west.
2/15/16, 11:13 - Emos: hmm it looks like a giant hospital
2/15/16, 11:13 - Cindy L: ....
2/15/16, 11:13 - Cindy L: A ghetto?
2/15/16, 11:13 - Cindy L: It's like a term to describe a neighbor hood
2/15/16, 11:13 - Emos: everythings white
2/15/16, 11:13 - Cindy L: So no pics.
2/15/16, 11:13 - Cindy L: Like u can hv the suburban neighborhood
2/15/16, 11:14 - Cindy L: And also a ghetto neighborhood
2/15/16, 11:14 - Cindy L: I gotta go.
2/15/16, 11:14 - Cindy L: Ttyl
2/15/16, 11:14 - Emos: ok

2/15/16, 12:21 - Cindy L: hair
2/15/16, 12:24 - Mom: how the girl who purports to transfer to us neuroscience? has she done the transfer application yet?
2/15/16, 12:24 - Cindy L: she applied first yr
2/15/16, 12:24 - Cindy L: uc berk
2/15/16, 12:25 - Cindy L: and some lib art college near upenn

2/15/16, 12:25 - Cindy L: need ref
2/15/16, 12:25 - Cindy L: and she did lse summer school so she asked them
2/15/16, 12:26 - Mom: why  she doesn't simply apply for transfer?
2/15/16, 12:26 - Mom: is it not applicable?
2/15/16, 12:27 - Cindy L: i don't remember why, but i she said she couldn't or something.
2/15/16, 12:27 - Cindy L: well i'm gonna meet her again so
2/15/16, 12:27 - Mom: well, is this situation apply to ur situation as well?
2/15/16, 12:27 - Cindy L: she's in exactly the same scenario.
2/15/16, 12:27 - Mom: i mean do u need to apply again through common app?
2/15/16, 12:27 - Cindy L: probs.
2/15/16, 12:28 - Cindy L: i need to ask today.
2/15/16, 12:28 - Mom: hurry
2/15/16, 12:28 - Cindy L: i have so many things to do toay.
2/15/16, 12:28 - Cindy L: i have so many things to do today.
2/15/16, 12:28 - Cindy L: and deadline's march
2/15/16, 12:28 - Cindy L: chill.
2/15/16, 12:28 - Cindy L: for now.
2/15/16, 12:28 - Mom: to ask earlier is better
2/15/16, 12:28 - Cindy L: sure
2/15/16, 12:29 - Cindy L: but ucl first.
2/15/16, 12:29 - Mom: when u did ur application to imperial, i also remind u to ask b4
2/15/16, 12:29 - Mom: ok
2/15/16, 12:29 - Cindy L: ask for transfer?
2/15/16, 12:29 - Cindy L: impossible
2/15/16, 12:29 - Cindy L: imperial doesn't take transfers.
2/15/16, 12:29 - Cindy L: and they are elitist.
2/15/16, 12:29 - Mom: not for imperial, for us unis
2/15/16, 12:29 - Cindy L: oh
2/15/16, 12:31 - Mom: do ur work first, ttyl
2/15/16, 17:38 - Cindy L: Just had third seizure of the day.
2/15/16, 17:38 - Cindy L: Dunno why so many today
2/15/16, 17:38 - Cindy L: I was just working on laptop in kitchen
2/15/16, 17:38 - Cindy L: Here's my notes on y
2/15/16, 17:38 - Cindy L: It
2/15/16, 17:39 - Cindy L: <Media omitted>
2/15/16, 17:45 - Mom: is it the food difference?
2/15/16, 17:46 - Mom: sleeping hrs between in Berlin and in London?
2/15/16, 17:48 - Mom: 30 mins seizures/shaking? that's is a very long time? can't image shaking/trembling for 30 mins? so u must be very tired after that seizure?
2/15/16, 23:39 - Cindy L: I just had another one.
2/15/16, 23:39 - Cindy L: Seriously.
2/15/16, 23:39 - Cindy L: This is like four in day...
2/15/16, 23:39 - Cindy L: I slept normal hrs.
2/15/16, 23:39 - Cindy L: Wait
2/15/16, 23:42 - Cindy L: I'm back
2/15/16, 23:42 - Cindy L: I just remembered
2/15/16, 23:43 - Cindy L: I saw something I thought was scary.
2/15/16, 23:43 - Cindy L: It's like that period of time I would get anxiety attack when I switched off the lights
2/15/16, 23:43 - Cindy L: I didn't even watch 5 secs
2/15/16, 23:44 - Cindy L: And I already had reaction.
2/15/16, 23:49 - Mom: Can u find other place to live out for like couple of days or wk?
2/16/16, 00:08 - Cindy L: Er why?
2/16/16, 00:09 - Cindy L: It was a YouTube video
2/16/16, 00:09 - Cindy L: I don't get anxiety attack in the dark anymore.
2/16/16, 00:09 - Cindy L: Kinda fixed that one by listening to music.
2/16/16, 00:10 - Cindy L: One in the afternoon was triggered by arousal.
2/16/16, 00:10 - Cindy L: Seizures I'm talking abt now
2/16/16, 00:10 - Cindy L: And mornings, I just tend to get them in the morning.
2/16/16, 00:11 - Cindy L: I had one in Berlin and that was in the cinema in the morning
2/16/16, 00:14 - Cindy L: Lol the girl i told u abt.
2/16/16, 00:14 - Cindy L: Trying to transfer as well
2/16/16, 00:14 - Cindy L: She went to nhs to try to get modafinil
2/16/16, 00:15 - Cindy L: Well ofc they didn't give it to her.
2/16/16, 00:15 - Cindy L: Well now we know.
2/16/16, 00:34 - Cindy L: The cold also makes me sleepy.
2/16/16, 00:34 - Cindy L: As in standing out in the cold for a long time
2/16/16, 00:34 - Cindy L: Then I will sleep while walking
2/16/16, 00:35 - Cindy L: There was that time I fell asleep in primark
2/16/16, 00:35 - Cindy L: And I just keep wandering around
2/16/16, 00:35 - Cindy L: Until this girl spoke to me and I snapped out of it.
2/16/16, 00:36 - Cindy L: I was conscious but I wasn't sure what I had been doing.
2/16/16, 00:44 - Mom: keep warm when the weather is cold
2/16/16, 00:45 - Mom: is the girl trying to transfer to us also suffering from narco?
2/16/16, 00:45 - Mom: how's ur sleep quality in Berlin?
2/16/16, 00:47 - Mom: try not to go outside when the weather is especially cold
2/16/16, 10:59 - Cindy L: Probably noy
2/16/16, 10:59 - Cindy L: Nhs told her to just get some rest.
2/16/16, 10:59 - Cindy L: Lol
2/16/16, 10:59 - Cindy L: Not that many ppl hv narco
2/16/16, 11:00 - Cindy L: Btw I did read this paper abt add symptoms in narco patients.
2/16/16, 11:00 - Cindy L: And I was wondering if the brain fog shit i had in the first yr were ADD symptoms.
2/16/16, 11:01 - Cindy L: Cuz the paper was talking abt how current medication had no effect on add symptoms.
2/16/16, 11:01 - Cindy L: Which seems to make sense to me cuz my brain fog didn't go away when I was on ritalin.
2/16/16, 11:05 - Mom: can u send me the link?
2/16/16, 11:12 - Cindy L: er i can't seem to find the original paper
2/16/16, 11:12 - Cindy L: but
2/16/16, 11:13 - Cindy L: this post is quite similar: http://www.addforums.com/forums/showthread.php?t=142968
2/16/16, 11:52 - Cindy L: also look at this: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/10/131010142926.htm
2/16/16, 12:43 - Mom: so current practice to prescribe antidepressants for cataplexy is totally in the opposite direction!!!
2/16/16, 13:30 - Cindy L: ... Chill this is a very complex issue.
2/16/16, 13:30 - Cindy L: So remember I had inflammation
2/16/16, 13:30 - Mom: btw, it didn't say anything relating to the triggering event - laughter
2/16/16, 13:30 - Cindy L: Possible cuz of high histamine production.
2/16/16, 13:31 - Cindy L: Cuz most narco research assume that narco-cataplexy both are caused by the same mechanism which is the lack of orexin
2/16/16, 13:31 - Mom: ivig shud be helpful in treating inflammation
2/16/16, 13:31 - Cindy L: No I actually read a paper which said that early ivig treatment had no effect
2/16/16, 13:32 - Cindy L: It's really recent like 2014
2/16/16, 13:32 - Mom: i'm saying ivig just help treat inflammation not narco
2/16/16, 13:33 - Cindy L: Yea but its muscle inflammation
2/16/16, 13:33 - Cindy L: Not inflammation in general
2/16/16, 13:33 - Cindy L: Plus the effects wear off
2/16/16, 13:33 - Cindy L: So by the time I went to test for inflammation again it probably wore off
2/16/16, 13:34 - Cindy L: Assuming that it had any effect at all
2/16/16, 13:34 - Mom: but i wonder is ur eczema that severe to make ur body inflamed so much?
2/16/16, 13:34 - Cindy L: eczema is just a symptom
2/16/16, 13:35 - Cindy L: its the gene which causes the production of abberant t-cells
2/16/16, 13:35 - Mom: but do u rlly feel something wrong with ur body at yr12?
2/16/16, 13:35 - Cindy L: no
2/16/16, 13:35 - Cindy L: except for eczema
2/16/16, 13:36 - Cindy L: something must have triggered a second wave of autoimmunity.
2/16/16, 13:36 - Cindy L: which is most likely influenza
2/16/16, 13:36 - Mom: so this is interesting
2/16/16, 13:36 - Cindy L: remember i did have the flu
2/16/16, 13:36 - Cindy L: sometime in easter
2/16/16, 13:36 - Mom: u didn't feel anything wrong, but ur neurotransmitters got imbalance?
2/16/16, 13:37 - Cindy L: ....
2/16/16, 13:37 - Cindy L: working on that one.
2/16/16, 13:38 - Cindy L: i read a paper which said upper respiratory disease can also trigger autoimmune response
2/16/16, 13:38 - Cindy L: which is similar to the h1n1 cases
2/16/16, 13:39 - Mom: this is rather horrible, just flu jab can bring serious effect
2/16/16, 13:39 - Cindy L: yea but nobody anticipated it
2/16/16, 13:41 - Cindy L: need to go and study some biochem now.
2/16/16, 13:41 - Mom: go where?
2/16/16, 13:41 - Mom: self study?
2/16/16, 13:42 - Cindy L: i meant look at the other pages.
2/16/16, 13:42 - Cindy L: i hv so many tabs open right now
2/16/16, 13:42 - Mom: kkk
2/16/16, 13:42 - Mom: me too
2/16/16, 13:42 - Cindy L: i don't think i have add though
2/16/16, 13:42 - Cindy L: maybe just difficulty to concentrate on things.
2/16/16, 13:43 - Cindy L: but that could be for anything
2/16/16, 13:43 - Mom: u do have difficulties focusing?
2/16/16, 13:43 - Cindy L: the other day i was in primark
2/16/16, 13:43 - Cindy L: and i was walking around, looking at clothes.
2/16/16, 13:44 - Cindy L: and then at some point i think i sort of shifted into a lowered consciousness
2/16/16, 13:44 - Cindy L: because
2/16/16, 13:44 - Cindy L: i was sure i was awake
2/16/16, 13:44 - Cindy L: cuz i could still walk around teh shop
2/16/16, 13:45 - Cindy L: but it was like i was sort of sleeping, cuz i really remember what i was doing, thinking or looking at
2/16/16, 13:45 - Cindy L: sorry i meant i don't really remember
2/16/16, 13:45 - Cindy L: i was like a wandering ghost
2/16/16, 13:45 - Cindy L: until a lady said something to me, she said "excuse me"
2/16/16, 13:46 - Cindy L: and i snapped back into full consciousness
2/16/16, 13:46 - Mom: i think add/focusing prob shud be those with repeated incidents for a period of time, not islolated incident
2/16/16, 13:46 - Cindy L: and then when i went to fitting room, i noticed i had gotten some clothes i don't remember choosing
2/16/16, 13:47 - Cindy L: no but these incidents used to happen a lot more often
2/16/16, 13:47 - Cindy L: its also like the incident at hyde park.
2/16/16, 13:47 - Mom: now or b4 yr13?
2/16/16, 13:47 - Cindy L: before
2/16/16, 13:48 - Cindy L: this is basically similar to what use to happen in math
2/16/16, 13:48 - Cindy L: like i don't exactly fall fully asleep
2/16/16, 13:48 - Mom: u mean b4 u had sleeping disorder?
2/16/16, 13:48 - Cindy L: no yr 13 math
2/16/16, 13:49 - Cindy L: when i can't even solve easy problems
2/16/16, 13:49 - Mom: can we take these episodes as falling between wakefulness and sleeping?
2/16/16, 13:49 - Cindy L: and i could write on the paper properly
2/16/16, 13:49 - Cindy L: couldn't
2/16/16, 13:49 - Cindy L: yea sort of
2/16/16, 13:50 - Cindy L: i'm not really sure
2/16/16, 13:50 - Cindy L: like i still continue to do stuff, but it gets harder to do the task and there's a point where i 'wake up' from it, and realise that i had been acting weirdly
2/16/16, 13:51 - Mom: add/difficult to focus shud be that incident when ur mindset are engaged in other activities instead of the current one
2/16/16, 13:51 - Cindy L: nevermind then
2/16/16, 13:51 - Cindy L: it's kinda like dreaming?
2/16/16, 13:51 - Mom: that shud be jumps between wakefulness and sleeping
2/16/16, 13:52 - Cindy L: yea microsleep then
2/16/16, 13:52 - Mom: yea, ur conscious level drops -- initial stage of sleeping
2/16/16, 13:52 - Cindy L: the other day i was copying down some stuff
2/16/16, 13:52 - Mom: not exactly microsleep
2/16/16, 13:53 - Cindy L: and then at some point i 'woke up' and i read what i wrote and it was a bunch of gibberish
2/16/16, 13:53 - Cindy L: but when i was writing, i seemed to make sense to me.
2/16/16, 13:54 - Mom: it's ur sleep cycle having prob
2/16/16, 13:54 - Cindy L: yea
2/16/16, 13:55 - Cindy L: its like when i'm dreaming i completely understand what's happening in the dream
2/16/16, 13:55 - Cindy L: but as soon as i wake up and regain cognitive abilities, even if i remember the dream events, it doesn't make sense
2/16/16, 13:56 - Mom: do u think u've cognitive impairment now?
2/16/16, 13:56 - Cindy L: no
2/16/16, 13:56 - Mom: k
2/16/16, 13:56 - Cindy L: i think the emotive part of the brain doesn't switch off when u sleep and is in charge of creating dreams
2/16/16, 13:57 - Cindy L: and the amygdala is mostly responsible for this especially since it deals with instinctive behaviour and emos
2/16/16, 13:58 - Mom: rmb that when u dream, ur not sleeping
2/16/16, 13:59 - Cindy L: ok during rem
2/16/16, 13:59 - Mom: ur eeg is like wakeful state
2/16/16, 13:59 - Cindy L: when u rem
2/16/16, 13:59 - Cindy L: the brain is probably divided between cognitive function and emotive functions
2/16/16, 14:00 - Cindy L: rem is probably when cognitive function switches off, but emotive stays on
2/16/16, 14:00 - Mom: do u know which part of the brain deals with emotions?
2/16/16, 14:00 - Cindy L: amygdala is the powerhouse of the limbic system.
2/16/16, 14:01 - Cindy L: its also easily affected by stress
2/16/16, 14:01 - Cindy L: which is probably what messed up my neurotransmitters.
2/16/16, 14:01 - Mom: u think u felt stressful at yr12?
2/16/16, 14:02 - Cindy L: ofc lah
2/16/16, 14:02 - Cindy L: deadline
2/16/16, 14:02 - Cindy L: and also i was a bit messed up emotionally.
2/16/16, 14:03 - Mom: it shud be but u didn't look like stressful at that time
2/16/16, 14:03 - Cindy L: cuz i have high tolerance.
2/16/16, 14:03 - Cindy L: some people can have anxiety attacks due to stress
2/16/16, 14:03 - Cindy L: and they don't know it themselves.
2/16/16, 14:05 - Mom: nvm
2/16/16, 14:06 - Cindy L: so if u think about it
2/16/16, 14:06 - Mom: now we have a more clear pic of what had happened with ur brain and we can work out for more
2/16/16, 14:06 - Cindy L: my genotype already meant that i would be prone to high lvl of histamine
2/16/16, 14:07 - Cindy L: stress messes with the balance of neurotransmitters, esp noradrenaline
2/16/16, 14:07 - Cindy L: noradrenaline controls production of dopamine, so that's how i developed cataplexy
2/16/16, 14:09 - Cindy L: and having sleep paralysis and fear of the dark in general increased anxiety.
2/16/16, 14:10 - Cindy L: sleep cycles are controlled by neurotransmitters, esp rem
2/16/16, 14:11 - Cindy L: oh serotonin also affects appetite and metabolism which explains how i increased 20 kg so quickly.
2/16/16, 17:48 - Cindy L: Mopps
2/16/16, 17:48 - Cindy L: I know its late
2/16/16, 17:48 - Mom: yea
2/16/16, 17:48 - Cindy L: But should I apply biomed eng
2/16/16, 17:48 - Cindy L: To ucl or imperial first
2/16/16, 17:48 - Mom: u like la
2/16/16, 17:49 - Cindy L: Cuz adding extra
2/16/16, 17:49 - Cindy L: U can only do one at a time.
2/16/16, 17:49 - Mom: can u still add extra now?
2/16/16, 17:49 - Mom: u mean add one extra only?
2/16/16, 17:49 - Cindy L: Well I can use my 4 other choices
2/16/16, 17:49 - Cindy L: No
2/16/16, 17:49 - Cindy L: They're like
2/16/16, 17:49 - Cindy L: U gotta apply one by one
2/16/16, 17:49 - Cindy L: And if u get a reply u accept or decline
2/16/16, 17:50 - Mom: then u can add to both uni?
2/16/16, 17:50 - Cindy L: No
2/16/16, 17:50 - Cindy L: Must be one by one
2/16/16, 17:50 - Mom: then can u meet the deadline?
2/16/16, 17:50 - Cindy L: It's like applying for work exp
2/16/16, 17:50 - Cindy L: No I just send the same ucad app
2/16/16, 17:50 - Cindy L: Ucas app
2/16/16, 17:50 - Mom: what abt the ps?
2/16/16, 17:51 - Cindy L: Never mind lah
2/16/16, 17:51 - Cindy L: I saw them in extra
2/16/16, 17:51 - Cindy L: So there must be spaces left.
2/16/16, 17:51 - Mom: but u don't hv bio or chem?
2/16/16, 17:51 - Cindy L: Don't need for biomed eng
2/16/16, 17:51 - Cindy L: Only need physics and math
2/16/16, 17:52 - Mom: if u rlly want to do neurosci in master, u shud get a relevant first deg, that's my opion
2/16/16, 17:52 - Mom: opinion
2/16/16, 17:52 - Cindy L: I think I should go to ucl? It's 3 yrs and cheaper and their neuroscience course is best in the world?
2/16/16, 17:52 - Mom: ok
2/16/16, 17:52 - Cindy L: Yeah biomed is abt as relevant as I can manage
2/16/16, 17:53 - Mom: if u decide to do that, then go ahead la
2/16/16, 17:53 - Cindy L: And as long as they give me to interview, I can convince them of my medical history. Lol
2/16/16, 17:54 - Mom: what abt the us uni?
2/16/16, 17:54 - Cindy L: Hard to transfer
2/16/16, 17:54 - Mom: and what're the requirements for biomed at ucl?
2/16/16, 17:55 - Cindy L: Er like 34-38
2/16/16, 17:55 - Mom: u mean no chance of transfering to us uni?
2/16/16, 17:55 - Cindy L: Not no chance.
2/16/16, 17:55 - Cindy L: But difficult.
2/16/16, 17:56 - Cindy L: So can only do a few.
2/16/16, 17:56 - Mom: biomed do things like prost?
2/16/16, 17:56 - Cindy L: What's prost?
2/16/16, 17:56 - Mom: is it medical related?
2/16/16, 17:56 - Cindy L: Yea..
2/16/16, 17:56 - Mom: fake limbs
2/16/16, 17:56 - Cindy L: Oh yeah prosthetics
2/16/16, 17:56 - Mom: can't spell the word
2/16/16, 17:56 - Cindy L: Mri
2/16/16, 17:56 - Cindy L: Ct scans
2/16/16, 17:56 - Cindy L: Radiation
2/16/16, 17:57 - Cindy L: Pacemakera
2/16/16, 17:57 - Mom: those r allied health group
2/16/16, 17:57 - Cindy L: Yea but I only need it as stepping stone
2/16/16, 17:57 - Cindy L: I just checked neuroscience is mostly a postgrad as well
2/16/16, 17:58 - Mom: if u want to do neurosci, u got to be a medical doctor
2/16/16, 17:58 - Cindy L: No I just want to fix my brain.
2/16/16, 17:59 - Mom: i understand that, but u don't have the chance to learn the med stuff properly
2/16/16, 17:59 - Cindy L: What do u mean. Im gonna go into neuroscience?
2/16/16, 18:00 - Cindy L: Neuroscience is multidisciplinary
2/16/16, 18:00 - Cindy L: Some pioneering neuroscientists came from math background?
2/16/16, 18:00 - Cindy L: Don't necessary need med.
2/16/16, 18:00 - Cindy L: Biochemistry is more important imo
2/16/16, 18:01 - Cindy L: But no chem. Anyways I can just read that myself.
2/16/16, 18:01 - Mom: did u read the requirement for a master in neurosci?
2/16/16, 18:01 - Cindy L: OK lemme do that
2/16/16, 18:05 - Cindy L: Hmm ucl just says u need 2:1 bachelor
2/16/16, 18:05 - Cindy L: And demonstrate relevant experience
2/16/16, 18:05 - Cindy L: I think firsthand experience is pretty relevant.
2/16/16, 18:07 - Cindy L: Oxford accepts physical science background
2/16/16, 18:08 - Mom: what's physical science?
2/16/16, 18:08 - Cindy L: Like not a social science
2/16/16, 18:10 - Cindy L: Cambridge is the same.
2/16/16, 18:10 - Mom: nvm
2/16/16, 18:10 - Mom: if u rlly want to do it, it will be fine
2/16/16, 18:11 - Cindy L: Cmu has the brainhub.
2/16/16, 18:12 - Mom: but i'm a bit worried if they'll be open-mind enough to take u, and u hv to prepare for the embarrassment and frustration
2/16/16, 18:13 - Mom: can u do physics in ur first deg and then neurosci for master?
2/16/16, 18:14 - Cindy L: Physics is not very relevant... U see
2/16/16, 18:14 - Cindy L: Better to do biomed engineering.
2/16/16, 18:14 - Mom: is it possible to do the lse ---> columbia pathway?
2/16/16, 18:14 - Mom: then u can choose a variety at columbia
2/16/16, 18:14 - Cindy L: Columbia doesn't take international transfer
2/16/16, 18:15 - Mom: what? they say in their website?
2/16/16, 18:15 - Cindy L: Yar
2/16/16, 18:16 - Mom: have u send them an email?
2/16/16, 18:16 - Cindy L: I can't apply as first yr now.
2/16/16, 18:17 - Mom: but what i meant is: have u ask abt the transfer from lse through emailing them?
2/16/16, 18:19 - Cindy L: Wait.
2/16/16, 18:22 - Cindy L: Probably not.
2/16/16, 18:23 - Cindy L: I think I need to apply as first yr.
2/16/16, 18:26 - Mom: i mean if u want to go there, just emailing them and telling them that ur at lse but want to do  a major in biomed subjects which is not available at lse right now, ofc u've to tell them ur reasons for doing this and ask them if they consider this kind of application?
2/16/16, 18:26 - Mom: don't bother the formal route
2/16/16, 18:32 - Cindy L: Ok
2/16/16, 18:34 - Mom: BSc Biomedical Sciences (B990)
2/16/16, 18:34 - Mom: ru taling abt this course at ucl?
2/16/16, 18:34 - Cindy L: No bio med eng
2/16/16, 18:34 - Cindy L: Biomedical engineering
2/16/16, 18:34 - Cindy L: There's one at imperial too, but it looks super hardcore
2/16/16, 18:34 - Cindy L: I think I will die.
2/16/16, 18:49 - Mom: i just read the ucl's biomed eng course details, i think it will be rather difficult to apply for neurosci with this first deg cuz the course doesn't provide any teaching in cell biology or molecular biology thingy
2/16/16, 18:54 - Cindy L: I think u can also do a minor for ucl engineering
2/16/16, 18:55 - Cindy L: I'm emailing Columbia right now.
2/16/16, 18:57 - Mom: actaully, u shud try a few more unis simultaneously at the time u appy for imperial design engrg cuz nothing is guaranteed
2/16/16, 18:57 - Mom: so if u rlly want to go, do it now as soon as possible
2/16/16, 19:10 - Cindy L: Ok i just said personal health reasons.
2/16/16, 19:11 - Cindy L: So I should try imperial biomed
2/16/16, 19:11 - Mom: do it if u want to
2/16/16, 19:12 - Cindy L: Ok
2/16/16, 19:12 - Cindy L: It's really expensive though
2/16/16, 19:12 - Cindy L: Just saying.
2/16/16, 19:12 - Mom: anyway, it's just a trial, ur not guaranteed a place yet
2/16/16, 19:12 - Mom: how much?
2/16/16, 19:12 - Cindy L: But I guess so is columbia
2/16/16, 19:13 - Cindy L: I just wrote personal health reasons in my email, u think it's OK?
2/16/16, 19:13 - Mom: personal reason?
2/16/16, 19:13 - Cindy L: Yea like I wrote personal health reasons as the reason for transfer
2/16/16, 19:14 - Mom: i meant personal health reason is too much, personal reason to do biochem or neurosci thingy will be ok
2/16/16, 19:15 - Cindy L: Yea but I can't say I hv a personal reason for doing biochem.
2/16/16, 19:15 - Cindy L: I mean everyone has a personal reason for biochem.
2/16/16, 19:16 - Cindy L: How bout personal health related reason for biochem.
2/16/16, 19:16 - Cindy L: I mentioned what major I was trying to transfer into dw
2/16/16, 19:17 - Mom: "health related" is clumsy
2/16/16, 19:18 - Cindy L: that's why personal health resons
2/16/16, 19:18 - Mom: did u write something to polish their academic excellence and the free choice of subjects
2/16/16, 19:19 - Cindy L: no
2/16/16, 19:19 - Mom: too bad
2/16/16, 19:19 - Cindy L: i was just asking if they would consider my case
2/16/16, 19:19 - Mom: u shud do that
2/16/16, 19:19 - Cindy L: i did think that maybe i should mention that i wanted to do research as well
2/16/16, 19:19 - Mom: u sent that email already?
2/16/16, 19:20 - Cindy L: basically i said that i wanted to major in biochem to go on to study neurosci
2/16/16, 19:20 - Cindy L: no
2/16/16, 19:21 - Cindy L: i could add study and do research in neurosci
2/16/16, 19:21 - Mom: 1) reason for asking a transfer bc no biochem subjects at lse
2/16/16, 19:21 - Cindy L: yea i mentioned that as well
2/16/16, 19:22 - Mom: 2) reason for choosing columbia ofc this is polishing
2/16/16, 19:23 - Mom: nvm, u hv already did that, just wait to see how they reply
2/16/16, 19:23 - Cindy L: erm but this is just asking whether they will consider my case
2/16/16, 19:23 - Cindy L: i will do the polishing in app
2/16/16, 19:24 - Mom: no, polishing is important for asking a chance especially u hv missed all the deadline
2/16/16, 19:24 - Mom: nvm
2/16/16, 19:24 - Mom: what abt other unis?
2/16/16, 19:25 - Mom: u shud try several more uni, don't just wait one by one
2/16/16, 19:26 - Cindy L: erm no
2/16/16, 19:26 - Cindy L: i haven't
2/16/16, 19:26 - Cindy L: transfer deadline is march
2/16/16, 19:27 - Cindy L: hopefully they don't think i'm insane or something.
2/16/16, 19:26 - Mom: don't wait for the deadline
2/16/16, 19:27 - Mom: always do it as early as possible
2/16/16, 19:27 - Mom: btw, not every uni wud consider transfer from oversea
2/16/16, 19:27 - Cindy L: whatever i'll try uc next.
2/16/16, 19:28 - Mom: that's not insane
2/16/16, 19:28 - Cindy L: well u know, people's general perception of mental disorder is that you're insane.
2/16/16, 19:28 - Mom: u hv to tell them u had the determination to do ur job
2/16/16, 19:29 - Cindy L: lemme see what they say first okay?
2/16/16, 19:29 - Mom: but for med scholars, they shudn't perceive mental illness like that
2/16/16, 19:30 - Mom: btw, u don't have mental probs seriously
2/16/16, 19:31 - Mom: i honestly believe that u just have emotional distress, but cognitive impairment
2/16/16, 19:31 - Mom: * but not
2/16/16, 19:42 - Cindy L: Emotional distress is a mental disorder.
2/16/16, 19:42 - Mom: they reply already?
2/16/16, 19:42 - Cindy L: No
2/16/16, 19:42 - Cindy L: I reply
2/16/16, 19:42 - Cindy L: Imperial is 27k
2/16/16, 19:43 - Mom: i read their website already
2/16/16, 19:43 - Mom: and ucl's is 22K+
2/16/16, 19:44 - Cindy L: Ok
2/16/16, 19:44 - Cindy L: Oh
2/16/16, 19:44 - Cindy L: Then imperial seems to be more worth it
2/16/16, 19:45 - Mom: it seems but u can't decide at this stage right?
2/16/16, 19:45 - Cindy L: i'm looking at the webpage
2/16/16, 19:45 - Cindy L: and it just looks like a death program to me
2/16/16, 19:46 - Cindy L: so many things to learn....
2/16/16, 19:46 - Mom: the difference is that imperial writes every detail in their website, while ucl just describe the course brieftly
2/16/16, 19:47 - Cindy L: yah that's very true
2/16/16, 19:47 - Mom: engrg is a tough course, whichever engrg
2/16/16, 19:48 - Cindy L: oh btw
2/16/16, 19:48 - Mom: so, i believe that most of the imperial grad wud prefer to go into ib rather than an enger
2/16/16, 19:48 - Cindy L: no.
2/16/16, 19:48 - Cindy L: then they should have came to lse
2/16/16, 19:48 - Cindy L: there's no point in studying engineering if u're going into ib
2/16/16, 19:48 - Cindy L: that's just killing ur brain and kidneys.
2/16/16, 19:49 - Cindy L: plus u need time to practice interview and reasoning tests and network
2/16/16, 19:49 - Cindy L: and imperial kids have no time.
2/16/16, 19:50 - Cindy L: i hope columbia takes me, that would be the best of all worlds.
2/16/16, 19:52 - Mom: well, choosing a course at uni is quite different from choosing a career after grad
2/16/16, 19:53 - Cindy L: tbh all i need is labs and jstor access
2/16/16, 19:53 - Mom: ppl make change all the time and lots of ppl change their career mindset after studying for 3-4 yrs at college
2/16/16, 19:54 - Cindy L: sure
2/16/16, 19:54 - Cindy L: i think i can say
2/16/16, 19:54 - Cindy L: now
2/16/16, 19:54 - Cindy L: that i have ambition.
2/16/16, 19:54 - Cindy L: and a life purpose
2/16/16, 19:54 - Cindy L: lol
2/16/16, 19:55 - Cindy L: how depressing.
2/16/16, 19:55 - Mom: u know this yr's Miss Hong Kong is a law grad from cambridge?
2/16/16, 19:56 - Mom: she joined the beauty contest and goes into the entertainment career
2/16/16, 19:58 - Cindy L: yeah so what
2/16/16, 19:57 - Mom: no, i just want to say ppl used to change their mind when they're confront with a career decision
2/16/16, 19:58 - Mom: bc ur 4 yrs older than when u chose ur uni major
2/16/16, 19:58 - Cindy L: Kk
2/16/16, 19:59 - Cindy L: What a waste of that Cambridge education though
2/16/16, 19:59 - Cindy L: at least go work at bbc
2/16/16, 20:00 - Cindy L: entertainment is totally a networking career
2/16/16, 20:00 - Mom: ok, do ur uni stuff
2/16/16, 20:00 - Mom: hv u eaten ur dinner?
2/16/16, 20:01 - Cindy L: No I already worked yesterday
2/16/16, 20:02 - Cindy L: It's been a very long day.
2/16/16, 20:02 - Cindy L: For some reason
2/16/16, 20:02 - Mom: u did all the applications?
2/16/16, 20:02 - Cindy L: I guess
2/16/16, 20:02 - Mom: not lse stuff
2/16/16, 20:03 - Cindy L: Oh
2/16/16, 20:03 - Cindy L: I'm looking at MIT now.
2/16/16, 20:05 - Cindy L: ok nvm
2/16/16, 20:06 - Mom: what?
2/16/16, 20:06 - Cindy L: I meant nvm mit
2/16/16, 20:07 - Mom: forget abt that
2/16/16, 20:07 - Mom: ?
2/16/16, 20:07 - Cindy L: maybe i can try jhu again
2/16/16, 20:08 - Mom: ok, just try
2/17/16, 15:39 - Cindy L: okay so
2/17/16, 15:39 - Cindy L: i got a reply
2/17/16, 15:40 - Cindy L: and basically she cuz copied what was on the transfers admission page and sent it to me
2/17/16, 15:45 - Mom: i just read the international trf admission criteria, i think u can apply
2/17/16, 15:45 - Mom: https://undergrad.admissions.columbia.edu/apply/international#internationaltransfer
2/17/16, 15:45 - Cindy L: yea i know
2/17/16, 15:45 - Cindy L: but i am filling out the common app
2/17/16, 15:45 - Cindy L: and
2/17/16, 15:46 - Cindy L: i can't input any of my courses.
2/17/16, 15:46 - Cindy L: cuz they only hv options for us style college.
2/17/16, 15:47 - Cindy L: not to mention i need to get references....
2/17/16, 15:48 - Cindy L: anyways i started looking at ucas extra.
2/17/16, 15:49 - Cindy L: and apparently u can apply for different disciplines using ucas extra.
2/17/16, 15:49 - Mom: r there space to fill in ur current uni or course?
2/17/16, 15:50 - Cindy L: u mean lse?
2/17/16, 15:50 - Mom: the common app
2/17/16, 15:50 - Cindy L: yeah all i can put in is the name of my current uni
2/17/16, 15:51 - Cindy L: and that's about it
2/17/16, 15:51 - Cindy L: and then u're supposed to fill in ur current courses
2/17/16, 15:51 - Cindy L: its like form nightmare again....
2/17/16, 15:51 - Mom: r there spaces?
2/17/16, 15:51 - Cindy L: yeah they only let u choose
2/17/16, 15:51 - Cindy L: semester
2/17/16, 15:51 - Cindy L: or quarter
2/17/16, 15:52 - Cindy L: and also 2 year instution and 4 year institution
2/17/16, 15:52 - Mom: can u not choose sem/quarter?
2/17/16, 15:52 - Cindy L: yeah i mean i can just put it in randomly
2/17/16, 15:53 - Cindy L: but i think i need to ask again.
2/17/16, 15:53 - Cindy L: sigh
2/17/16, 15:53 - Mom: ask who and what?
2/17/16, 15:53 - Cindy L: admissions about how to fill enter my school and course details
2/17/16, 15:53 - Cindy L: cuz everything's in us format.
2/17/16, 15:53 - Cindy L: i can't enter anything in properly.
2/17/16, 15:54 - Mom: can u put in course name and duration?
2/17/16, 15:54 - Cindy L: no
2/17/16, 15:54 - Mom: not even course name?
2/17/16, 15:55 - Cindy L: only name
2/17/16, 15:55 - Mom: course name or uni name?
2/17/16, 15:55 - Cindy L: module names.
2/17/16, 15:55 - Cindy L: in us, modules are courses
2/17/16, 15:55 - Mom: that's course taken name
2/17/16, 15:56 - Cindy L: no
2/17/16, 15:56 - Cindy L: i can't enter my degree name
2/17/16, 15:56 - Mom: that means u can fill in uni name and course name
2/17/16, 15:56 - Cindy L: i need to enter my individual modules
2/17/16, 15:56 - Cindy L: like what i spent this year studying
2/17/16, 15:56 - Cindy L: i can fill in uni name yes
2/17/16, 15:56 - Cindy L: but that's it
2/17/16, 15:56 - Cindy L: i can't fill out any details at all
2/17/16, 15:57 - Cindy L: cuz everythign is in american
2/17/16, 15:57 - Mom: but there shud be space for course taken?
2/17/16, 15:57 - Cindy L: what do you mean by course?
2/17/16, 15:57 - Cindy L: they don't expect u to have major yet.
2/17/16, 15:57 - Mom: yea uk is different from us
2/17/16, 15:57 - Cindy L: basically there is no space to write, i am taking government and economics
2/17/16, 15:58 - Mom: can u take a pic and let me see?
2/17/16, 15:58 - Cindy L: i'm just gonna email them and ask
2/17/16, 15:58 - Mom: nvm
2/17/16, 15:59 - Mom: so i wud suggest u try as well
2/17/16, 15:59 - Mom: if u rlly want to change ur major
2/17/16, 15:59 - Cindy L: i wrote london school of economics
2/17/16, 15:59 - Cindy L: but i don't think they realise its a uk school.....
2/17/16, 15:59 - Mom: lse and political sci
2/17/16, 16:00 - Mom: well, i don't think they have no idea of this uni
2/17/16, 16:00 - Cindy L: yeah i wanna change my degree, but this is turning out to be a nightmare.
2/17/16, 16:00 - Mom: cuz lse and columbia r strategic partner
2/17/16, 16:00 - Cindy L: sure.....
2/17/16, 16:00 - Mom: what nightmare?
2/17/16, 16:00 - Cindy L: i wonder if they know london is not in us.
2/17/16, 16:01 - Mom: i don't think so, cuz us ppl know lse
2/17/16, 16:01 - Cindy L: sure the rest of the world do
2/17/16, 16:01 - Cindy L: but u know, americans..
2/17/16, 16:01 - Mom: but that's new york
2/17/16, 16:01 - Mom: not texas not neveda
2/17/16, 16:02 - Cindy L: lse barely has any recognition across the pond u know....
2/17/16, 16:02 - Cindy L: people always argue about this on forums
2/17/16, 16:02 - Mom: don't stick with this issue, just try to fill out the app form if u want to apply
2/17/16, 16:03 - Cindy L: yea the form is a nightmare as well
2/17/16, 16:03 - Mom: u did that last year, u shud be well-verse with these forms right?
2/17/16, 16:03 - Cindy L: doesn't mean i like filling them out.
2/17/16, 16:03 - Mom: don't complain, just do asap if u want a change
2/17/16, 16:04 - Mom: or else just stay at lse and complete ur gov't and econ deg
2/17/16, 16:04 - Cindy L: i'm pretty sure i'll do all of this crap, pay the money and nothing will probably happen
2/17/16, 16:04 - Mom: so don't to try again?
2/17/16, 16:04 - Cindy L: yah i'm actually having second thoughts.
2/17/16, 16:04 - Mom: what?
2/17/16, 16:05 - Mom: don't waste ur time swaying back and and forth
2/17/16, 16:06 - Cindy L: i'm not i already filled out half of the common app.
2/17/16, 16:06 - Mom: good
2/17/16, 16:06 - Cindy L: except the bit where they ask me for my parents details and whole life history again/
2/17/16, 16:06 - Cindy L: and i srsly want to rip my hair out at that point
2/17/16, 16:07 - Mom: u shud have record form last yr and most of the thing inside just copy from last yr
2/17/16, 16:07 - Mom: do u keep record from last yr?
2/17/16, 16:07 - Cindy L: i did
2/17/16, 16:08 - Mom: keep calm and just copy from last yr
2/17/16, 16:08 - Cindy L: i also have work to do!
2/17/16, 16:08 - Mom: why having trouble with parents' detail?
2/17/16, 16:08 - Cindy L: not to mention where to get references?
2/17/16, 16:08 - Cindy L: columbia requires two.
2/17/16, 16:09 - Mom: can u ask morrison and edward again?
2/17/16, 16:09 - Cindy L: no must be college instructor
2/17/16, 16:09 - Cindy L: u dipshit
2/17/16, 16:10 - Cindy L: why is life so difficult.
2/17/16, 16:14 - Cindy L: plus i don't think i even have a uni transcript cuz i don't get grades until the end of the year.
2/17/16, 16:14 - Cindy L: lol
2/17/16, 16:15 - Mom: bc uk is different from us
2/17/16, 16:15 - Cindy L: yea
2/17/16, 16:16 - Cindy L: apparently u can just call them up and ask for a place during clearing.
2/17/16, 16:16 - Cindy L: lol
2/17/16, 16:19 - Cindy L: üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
2/17/16, 16:19 - Mom: where? uk?
2/17/16, 16:19 - Cindy L: fml
2/17/16, 16:20 - Mom: back to columbia, i just read info for international student trf, they don't require u to fill in the course : "Post-secondary work can be considered for possible transfer credit after you are admitted to Columbia and accept our offer."
2/17/16, 16:21 - Cindy L: yeah i know
2/17/16, 16:21 - Mom: so don't bother the individual course taken during ur first yr
2/17/16, 16:22 - Mom: i think for the reference, u still can ask kgv's tutors
2/17/16, 16:24 - Mom: and for the semster transcript, u can give them details telling them that is not available until end of the yr cuz ur uni is a british one and they give out exam record only at the end of the yr
2/17/16, 16:25 - Mom: u can explain it at supplementary lines
2/17/16, 16:25 - Cindy L: i'm just asking them if there's another application form.
2/17/16, 16:26 - Mom: sigh, why wud they have?
2/17/16, 16:26 - Cindy L: cuz i know they do.
2/17/16, 16:26 - Mom: rlly?
2/17/16, 16:26 - Mom: how do u know?
2/17/16, 16:26 - Cindy L: last time i applied for columbia it wasn't through common app.
2/17/16, 16:27 - Mom: but that's dual ba, which i think is different
2/17/16, 16:27 - Cindy L: and i don't think they understood my situation in the original email....
2/17/16, 16:28 - Mom: hey, u said the other phil girl intend to trf to us, can u ask her how she fill out the form?
2/17/16, 16:29 - Cindy L: yeah okay
2/17/16, 16:29 - Cindy L: i'll try to find her.
2/17/16, 16:30 - Cindy L: justin said he couldn't transfer from ucl to lse though
2/17/16, 16:31 - Mom: i read columbia's website, they did allow transfer but as u said they just cater for us transfer not the whole wide world, so the form can not match with other country's situation
2/17/16, 16:31 - Cindy L: yeah
2/17/16, 16:32 - Mom: all u hv to do is try to fill in ur info as detail as possible
2/17/16, 16:32 - Mom: if u can not fill in the exact place, i think there wud be space for supplement info
2/17/16, 16:33 - Mom: then u can add ur details there
2/17/16, 16:33 - Cindy L: i have a lot of shit to ask them anyways.
2/17/16, 16:35 - Cindy L: i have to get my secondary school counsellor to send my hs transcript again.....
2/17/16, 16:35 - Cindy L: i'll probably need to pay them 200 bucks again.
2/17/16, 16:36 - Cindy L: this is like day light robbery.
2/17/16, 16:44 - Cindy L: i just had an idea
2/17/16, 16:45 - Cindy L: could u just pretend to be my high school adviser and mail all the shit for me?
2/17/16, 16:48 - Mom: yea, but the email is not from kgv
2/17/16, 16:48 - Cindy L: no u mail it to their office
2/17/16, 16:49 - Cindy L: the forms are submitted offline
2/17/16, 16:49 - Mom: from my email?
2/17/16, 16:49 - Cindy L: and most of them are a repeat of the common app
2/17/16, 16:49 - Cindy L: =.=
2/17/16, 16:49 - Cindy L: from post office.
2/17/16, 16:50 - Mom: u mean they require high school transcripts by post?
2/17/16, 16:50 - Cindy L: yep
2/17/16, 16:50 - Cindy L: and a couple of other forms.
2/17/16, 16:50 - Cindy L: that's why its form nightmare
2/17/16, 16:51 - Mom: then we can just do it ourselves, don't hv to ask kgv cuz we have the official transcript already
2/17/16, 16:51 - Cindy L: yea
2/17/16, 16:51 - Mom: what other forms?
2/17/16, 16:51 - Cindy L: but i waived ferpa
2/17/16, 16:51 - Cindy L: so i can't do it
2/17/16, 16:51 - Mom: ferpa?
2/17/16, 16:51 - Cindy L: its the right to see ur references
2/17/16, 16:52 - Mom: so we don't hv references now/
2/17/16, 16:52 - Mom: why waived in the first place?
2/17/16, 16:53 - Cindy L: you have to
2/17/16, 16:53 - Cindy L: or else they don't trust ur references
2/17/16, 16:54 - Mom: i see
2/17/16, 16:55 - Cindy L: tbh i think its easier to apply to a uk course through clearing
2/17/16, 16:55 - Cindy L: or extra
2/17/16, 16:55 - Mom: what type of uni u expect at clearing?
2/17/16, 16:55 - Mom: ucl? imperial?
2/17/16, 16:55 - Cindy L: i'm still seeing imperial courses in extra.
2/17/16, 16:56 - Mom: us is troublesome, not to mention their tax system
2/17/16, 16:56 - Cindy L: yea
2/17/16, 16:56 - Cindy L: and visa
2/17/16, 16:56 - Cindy L: healthcare
2/17/16, 16:56 - Cindy L: D:
2/17/16, 16:56 - Mom: tbh, don't waste ur time at imperial
2/17/16, 16:56 - Mom: u think there's a chance at clearing?
2/17/16, 16:57 - Cindy L: no
2/17/16, 16:57 - Cindy L: i'm thinking of applying to ucl through extra
2/17/16, 16:57 - Cindy L: do i can give a different ps
2/17/16, 16:57 - Mom: ucas is easy but rigid and not flexible
2/17/16, 16:57 - Cindy L: yea
2/17/16, 16:57 - Cindy L: but neithr is common app
2/17/16, 16:57 - Mom: just ucl?
2/17/16, 16:58 - Mom: just ask ucl?
2/17/16, 16:58 - Cindy L: anything less is not good.
2/17/16, 16:58 - Cindy L: there would be no point
2/17/16, 16:58 - Mom: commom app, u still can attach supplementary info
2/17/16, 16:58 - Cindy L: yea i'm filling out a common app too
2/17/16, 16:58 - Mom: and u don't hv to declare a major at the time of application
2/17/16, 16:59 - Cindy L: in common app?
2/17/16, 16:59 - Cindy L: i think u do.
2/17/16, 16:59 - Cindy L: i think it's better if u do at this stage
2/17/16, 16:59 - Mom: the good point is u don't use just one ps
2/17/16, 17:00 - Cindy L: there are also individual writing supplements
2/17/16, 17:00 - Mom: okay, stop arguing whether it's us or uk
2/17/16, 17:00 - Mom: how wud do decide now/
2/17/16, 17:01 - Cindy L: i needa break
2/17/16, 17:01 - Mom: to add ucas extra only or still go ahead for us?
2/17/16, 17:01 - Cindy L: well i can't do the extra thing now
2/17/16, 17:01 - Cindy L: so in the mean time i'm still filling out that common app shit
2/17/16, 17:02 - Mom: think abt it: if u don't do the transfer now, ur going to stuck at lse for 2 more yrs and u got a deg which is irrelevant to ur career option
2/17/16, 17:03 - Cindy L: hurr
2/17/16, 17:03 - Mom: and then u hv to start over the sci bit from zero again
2/17/16, 17:03 - Cindy L: not like i have much of a career option tbh
2/17/16, 17:03 - Cindy L: but i get ur point
2/17/16, 17:03 - Mom: don't think like that, or else u wud go into depression again
2/17/16, 17:04 - Cindy L: okay i have to at least change to do math or science
2/17/16, 17:04 - Mom: not advise to do maths at lse cuz business maths at lse is no help
2/17/16, 17:04 - Cindy L: its not business math.
2/17/16, 17:05 - Mom: maths at a social sci context is business maths and all u can do with this deg is go into actuarial firm
2/17/16, 17:05 - Cindy L: kk
2/17/16, 17:06 - Cindy L: and comp sci
2/17/16, 17:06 - Mom: what abt cmu? do they accept transfer from other uni?
2/17/16, 17:07 - Cindy L: yea they all accept transfer
2/17/16, 17:07 - Cindy L: just not international transfer.
2/17/16, 17:07 - Cindy L: and they require u to write a 1 page ps again =.=
2/17/16, 17:07 - Cindy L: i guess this one won't be too difficult to write though
2/17/16, 17:14 - Mom: where u saw "not internatonal transfer"? i can't see it
2/17/16, 17:14 - Cindy L: like they don't mention international transfer
2/17/16, 17:14 - Cindy L: so gotta email them too
2/17/16, 17:14 - Cindy L: i just looked at michigan
2/17/16, 17:15 - Cindy L: and it seems okay
2/17/16, 17:15 - Cindy L: not too much to gather
2/17/16, 17:15 - Mom: that doesn't mean they don't accept international transfer, in fact, they said they hv international student there
2/17/16, 17:16 - Cindy L: ofc koreans
2/17/16, 17:16 - Mom: i think u just mistaken their intention
2/17/16, 17:17 - Cindy L: im so sleepy all day.
2/17/16, 17:17 - Mom: why? bc cold weather?
2/17/16, 17:17 - Cindy L: no cuz i am narcoleptic
2/17/16, 17:17 - Mom: did u attend class today?
2/17/16, 17:18 - Cindy L: no classes
2/17/16, 17:18 - Mom: no energy to do things?
2/17/16, 17:18 - Cindy L: everytime i close my eyes, i am prone to falling alseep
2/17/16, 17:21 - Mom: can u afford ur workload now? or need to take a break at the second yr?
2/17/16, 17:21 - Cindy L: if i took a break, that woudl be worse
2/17/16, 17:21 - Cindy L: i need to get treated bascially.
2/17/16, 17:23 - Mom: go to nhs tell them ur tired all the time and for med? but don't mention ur narcoleptic otherwise u hv to pay ur med bill urself
2/17/16, 17:24 - Cindy L: i have adrafinil
2/17/16, 17:24 - Cindy L: haven't taken any yet.
2/17/16, 17:26 - Mom: u bought online?
2/17/16, 17:26 - Cindy L: last time
2/17/16, 17:26 - Mom: how wud that help?
2/17/16, 17:27 - Mom: pre-cursor of modafinil?
2/17/16, 17:28 - Cindy L: i'm also getting fatter i think
2/17/16, 17:29 - Mom: u don't do exercise, depression
2/17/16, 17:30 - Mom: don't bother whether fatter or not, u'll go into depression just with ur figure
2/17/16, 17:30 - Mom: anyway, ur not going to modelling, why bother?
2/17/16, 17:32 - Mom: just try to maintain routine sleep schedule, do exercise and relax....
2/17/16, 17:32 - Mom: these are the things a patient has to follow rigidly,
2/17/16, 17:33 - Mom: ru there?
2/17/16, 17:35 - Mom: seriously, i think u hv emotional probs right now? do meditation to calm down ur emotions
2/17/16, 17:37 - Cindy L: Any 19 yr old girl cares abt being fat.
2/17/16, 17:37 - Cindy L: Btw
2/17/16, 17:37 - Cindy L: Pls estimate our family's gross income for 2015
2/17/16, 17:37 - Mom: what's last yr's figure?
2/17/16, 17:38 - Cindy L: <Media omitted>
2/17/16, 17:38 - Cindy L: Choose from these options
2/17/16, 17:39 - Mom: 100,000 - 149,000
2/17/16, 17:39 - Cindy L: Good I guessed correctly
2/17/16, 17:39 - Mom: how much we choose last yr?
2/17/16, 17:40 - Cindy L: Can't remember
2/17/16, 17:40 - Mom: fine, nvm
2/17/16, 17:40 - Cindy L: I didn't hv this lst yr
2/17/16, 17:40 - Cindy L: But I didn't apply to Michigan last yr either
2/17/16, 17:41 - Mom: but ur choice shows 150k - 200k, not 100k - 149K?
2/17/16, 17:41 - Cindy L: Hai I hadn't clicked it yet when I took the photo
2/17/16, 17:42 - Mom: ok, just to clarify
2/17/16, 17:42 - Cindy L: Michigan is great no need for ref
2/17/16, 17:42 - Mom: btw, did u do exercise?
2/17/16, 17:42 - Cindy L: No
2/17/16, 17:42 - Mom: no need for ref?
2/17/16, 17:42 - Mom: u shud do exercise
2/17/16, 17:43 - Cindy L: Ain't nobody got time for exercise when its this cold
2/17/16, 17:43 - Cindy L: But after doig all this crap I'll sign up for the gym
2/17/16, 17:43 - Mom: exercise --> dopamine ---> Norepinephrine which helps reduce rem sleep
2/17/16, 17:43 - Cindy L: I was supposed to hv reading week this week
2/17/16, 17:44 - Cindy L: But turns out I didnt
2/17/16, 17:44 - Cindy L: Which sucks
2/17/16, 17:44 - Mom: why no reading week?
2/17/16, 17:44 - Cindy L: So I had to catch up with my previous six econ lectures
2/17/16, 17:44 - Cindy L: Dunno
2/17/16, 17:44 - Cindy L: Gv is too hard workibg
2/17/16, 17:45 - Cindy L: I mean it's not a bad course overall
2/17/16, 17:45 - Mom: frankly speaking, i don't think lse is that bad
2/17/16, 17:45 - Cindy L: But when u hv brain problems, voter behavior and prop rep is the least of ur problems.
2/17/16, 17:46 - Mom: just no proper uni campus
2/17/16, 17:46 - Cindy L: It's fine
2/17/16, 17:46 - Cindy L: Most people spend their time on society work
2/17/16, 17:47 - Mom: okay, i get ur point
2/17/16, 17:47 - Cindy L: It would be kinda dumb if I switch to a worse uni
2/17/16, 17:48 - Mom: but u want a different major
2/17/16, 17:48 - Cindy L: Yarh
2/17/16, 17:49 - Cindy L: Btw
2/17/16, 17:50 - Cindy L: I'm not supposed to hv anymore teeth growing on my bottom jaw right?
2/17/16, 17:50 - Mom: u already have 32 teeth, still want more?
2/17/16, 17:51 - Cindy L: No I just felt the back of my bottom jaw
2/17/16, 17:51 - Mom: it's kinda of sad when Emos read this msg
2/17/16, 17:51 - Mom: hv teeth growing out?
2/17/16, 17:51 - Cindy L: And it feels like there's something coming out.
2/17/16, 17:51 - Mom: what?
2/17/16, 17:52 - Cindy L: Or like trying to growth out here
2/17/16, 17:52 - Cindy L: U know the area where I had surgery
2/17/16, 17:52 - Mom: won't be teeth cuz u've x-ray already and it shows u won't hv any more teeth there
2/17/16, 17:52 - Mom: impossible
2/17/16, 17:53 - Cindy L: But it suddenly started feeling this way since yesterday
2/17/16, 17:53 - Mom: how's ur jaw position now?
2/17/16, 17:53 - Cindy L: Normal?
2/17/16, 17:54 - Mom: i think it's just teeth gum inflammation and get swollen
2/17/16, 17:54 - Cindy L: Maybe
2/17/16, 17:55 - Mom: i mean is ur lower jaw still in that position? didn't move forward?
2/17/16, 17:55 - Cindy L: No
2/17/16, 17:55 - Cindy L: Same as before.
2/17/16, 17:56 - Mom: ok
2/17/16, 17:56 - Mom: http://web.mst.edu/~rhall/neuroscience/03_sleep/sleepneuro.pdf
2/17/16, 17:56 - Mom: read this if u've time
2/17/16, 17:57 - Mom: it tells u the role of different hormone at sleep and their mechanism
2/17/16, 17:59 - Mom: https://www.google.com.hk/search?tbm=isch&tbs=rimg%3ACcD-WgOL4mGsIjjeuip5qPiRDCQeyNjuHuO6n4MG4e3Gu-66dhsxsHf6wICzZ2xQgTW5z2czJ-bJ-R1cGbmvhHGZ9SoSCd66Knmo-JEMEQnxg60KbCFQKhIJJB7I2O4e47oR8mGc7pbbKT4qEgmfgwbh7ca77hGpIYuoSPuLcCoSCbp2GzGwd_1rAEcUkM6qoIqHdKhIJgLNnbFCBNbkREnz-ZQuW8UcqEgnPZzMn5sn5HRH47JKxtXc2eCoSCVwZua-EcZn1EZCjP-W5YtD0&q=Peribrachial%20Area%20.&ved=0ahUKEwjG9Pf-2f7KAhXF2qYKHaujBEsQ9C8ICQ&dpr=1.25&biw=1093&bih=515#imgrc=wP5aA4viYaxxsM%3A
2/17/16, 17:59 - Mom: this link explains the mechanism abt muscle atonia
2/17/16, 21:04 - Cindy L: I already saw a paper which explains cataplexy by the norepinephrine mechanism
2/18/16, 00:02 - Cindy L: Sorry I'm sleeping so much today my perception of reality is really distorted.
2/18/16, 10:29 - Mom: hi
2/18/16, 10:54 - Cindy L: Hi
2/18/16, 10:57 - Mom: ru ok?
2/18/16, 10:59 - Cindy L: Yea
2/18/16, 10:59 - Cindy L: For some reason time went very slowly for the past two days.
2/18/16, 10:59 - Cindy L: Dunno why
2/18/16, 14:50 - Cindy L: Mopps, it's not working.
2/18/16, 14:53 - Mom: what?
2/18/16, 15:07 - Cindy L: The supplements ‚òπ
2/18/16, 15:08 - Cindy L: It's not gaba.
2/18/16, 15:08 - Cindy L: Which means sodium oxybate is a fluke
2/18/16, 15:11 - Mom: what hv u taken?
2/18/16, 16:06 - Cindy L: Phenibut
2/18/16, 16:17 - Cindy L: It looks like it's most likely related to norepinephrine and dopamine then.
2/18/16, 16:26 - Mom: how not working? describe ur feeling or response having taken it and how long u took it?
2/18/16, 16:44 - Cindy L: I took this morning
2/18/16, 16:44 - Cindy L: 5000 mg
2/18/16, 16:45 - Cindy L: I am literally shaking.
2/18/16, 16:45 - Cindy L: It's not reducing anything.
2/18/16, 16:45 - Mom: 5000mg?
2/18/16, 16:46 - Mom: is it too much?
2/18/16, 16:48 - Mom: i think u better stop trying these stuff
2/18/16, 16:49 - Mom: 5000? def too much
2/18/16, 16:49 - Cindy L: No sorry
2/18/16, 16:49 - Cindy L: 500
2/18/16, 16:50 - Cindy L: 500mg
2/18/16, 16:50 - Cindy L: Lol 5000 is 5grams, that's insane
2/18/16, 16:50 - Mom: how do u feel other than shaking?
2/18/16, 16:50 - Cindy L: The l theanine seems to hv similar effect.
2/18/16, 16:51 - Cindy L: Just more sensitive to stimuli
2/18/16, 16:51 - Mom: btw to start with 500 mg is even too much
2/18/16, 16:51 - Mom: how sensitive?
2/18/16, 16:51 - Cindy L: It's the recommended dosage
2/18/16, 16:51 - Mom: moody?
2/18/16, 16:51 - Cindy L: It came in capsules
2/18/16, 16:52 - Cindy L: Me?
2/18/16, 16:52 - Cindy L: Not really.
2/18/16, 16:52 - Mom: too slow in action?
2/18/16, 16:52 - Cindy L: Erm no.
2/18/16, 16:52 - Cindy L: Just more weakness
2/18/16, 16:53 - Mom: that's depressant feeling less energize is normal
2/18/16, 16:54 - Mom: but i don't think u shud take that drug anymore cuz no benefit at all
2/18/16, 16:58 - Mom: bc ur shaking and feel more weakness ---> obvious detrimental effect
2/18/16, 16:59 - Mom: and i wonder if it wud bring negative impact on ur heart
2/18/16, 17:01 - Mom: btw, don't go out until the drug's effect vanish cuz u never know whether there's any more allergic reaction
2/18/16, 17:01 - Mom: and do u know it's half life cycle?
2/18/16, 17:48 - Mom: cindy, i srsly urge u to stop ur ambitious self-administered drug therapy programme cuz u don't even have any knowledge abt those psychotic drugs and never know what actual impact wud bring to ur brain
2/18/16, 17:48 - Mom: u always said u had brain damage, do u rlly want more damage to ur brain?
2/18/16, 17:50 - Mom: think abt the worst scenario, u can't afford the cost, i bet
2/18/16, 18:31 - Cindy L: Half life is 5hrs
2/18/16, 18:31 - Cindy L: I'm stopping cuz obviously it ain't working
2/18/16, 18:31 - Cindy L: Back to square one.
2/18/16, 23:40 - Mom: ru still shaking and having weakness?
2/19/16, 07:35 - Cindy L: No
2/19/16, 07:35 - Cindy L: Just woke up
2/19/16, 07:35 - Cindy L: Didn't wake up at 4 so that's good
2/19/16, 07:36 - Cindy L: Ive been sleeping a lot of hrs this week though.
2/19/16, 07:37 - Cindy L: My sleep tracker says 7 hrs a night
2/19/16, 07:45 - Mom: Oh
2/19/16, 07:45 - Mom: I thought ur sleep tracker isnt working
2/19/16, 07:46 - Mom: still on that med?
2/19/16, 07:47 - Mom: How long hv u been shaking yesterday? Beware of the effect on HR
2/19/16, 07:49 - Mom: Just sleeping? Any nightmare or vivid dreams?
2/19/16, 08:42 - Cindy L: No
2/19/16, 08:42 - Mom: can i see ur sleep tracker record?
2/19/16, 08:42 - Cindy L: Latr
2/19/16, 08:42 - Cindy L: Class
2/19/16, 08:42 - Mom: kkk
2/19/16, 10:53 - Cindy L: Yo
2/19/16, 10:54 - Cindy L: I've decided to go see the NHS to ask how long lining up for mslt may take
2/19/16, 10:56 - Cindy L: And also if I can't change this year. I will use going back to stem stream as reason and essentially beg at the maths Dept to allow me to change into econ and math. This is my worst case scenario plan
2/19/16, 10:57 - Cindy L: Which will involve disclosing some bits of my health issue to the lse
2/19/16, 10:57 - Cindy L: Logically what do u think?
2/19/16, 10:58 - Cindy L: Do u see any practical issues which I have not considered?
2/19/16, 10:58 - Mom: to first of maths and econ?
2/19/16, 10:58 - Mom: don't understand can't change this yr?
2/19/16, 10:59 - Mom: not recommend disclosing ur health situation in hk?
2/19/16, 11:00 - Mom: otherwise u won't be covered by nhs insurance
2/19/16, 11:03 - Mom: and the med cost is rlly a big issue
2/19/16, 11:19 - Cindy L: Yea
2/19/16, 11:20 - Cindy L: I only plan to say I've been sleeping a lot recently
2/19/16, 11:20 - Cindy L: And mention maybe the walking around in primark incident.
2/19/16, 11:20 - Cindy L: Really all I want is to see if I hv to wait years to get an mslt or not.
2/19/16, 11:21 - Cindy L: Do u think I can just ask the nurse that?
2/19/16, 11:21 - Mom: which nurse?
2/19/16, 11:21 - Cindy L: At the reception
2/19/16, 11:21 - Mom: nhs?
2/19/16, 11:21 - Cindy L: Yea
2/19/16, 11:21 - Cindy L: Ppl online say they r waiting years to be treated.
2/19/16, 11:22 - Mom: i don't think she can decide
2/19/16, 11:22 - Cindy L: OK so I hv to see the md
2/19/16, 11:22 - Mom: i think that's probably true
2/19/16, 11:22 - Cindy L: Yea especially mental health cases
2/19/16, 11:23 - Cindy L: And most cases treatment is only SSRIs
2/19/16, 11:23 - Cindy L: And then they line up for CBT
2/19/16, 11:23 - Cindy L: Which doesnt really work.
2/19/16, 11:23 - Cindy L: And then they jump off buildings.
2/19/16, 11:23 - Mom: actually we already know the treatment
2/19/16, 11:23 - Cindy L: So sad.
2/19/16, 11:23 - Mom: and can't expect more
2/19/16, 11:24 - Cindy L: Yea but Im going to see adivisor
2/19/16, 11:24 - Mom: there're 2 therapy: med and cbt
2/19/16, 11:24 - Cindy L: To get her to fill out my transfer forms.
2/19/16, 11:24 - Mom: why transfer to maths and econ? better to cope the workload?
2/19/16, 11:25 - Cindy L: sorry i don't think i can deal with government.
2/19/16, 11:25 - Cindy L: i don't read the news these days.
2/19/16, 11:25 - Cindy L: so i don't even know what the hell they are talking about most of the time.
2/19/16, 11:25 - Cindy L: at least math is just numbers.
2/19/16, 11:26 - Cindy L: if i can't transfer, i'm literally going to the maths dept and cry in front of them.
2/19/16, 11:27 - Cindy L: and then blame it on depression ofc
2/19/16, 11:28 - Mom: ok
2/19/16, 11:28 - Cindy L: good plan
2/19/16, 11:28 - Cindy L: i'm also slightly depressed today. so i need to think extra logically.
2/19/16, 11:29 - Mom: how's ur health these days? u don't seem to talk abt it
2/19/16, 11:29 - Cindy L: what aspect of it?
2/19/16, 11:30 - Mom: sleep quality and emotional aspect
2/19/16, 11:30 - Cindy L: oh i took screenshots of my sleep tracking thing
2/19/16, 11:30 - Cindy L: should be in the dropbox
2/19/16, 11:30 - Cindy L: and then emotion. not sure?
2/19/16, 11:31 - Cindy L: i'm like a different person everyday and my i can't say my memory is good nowadays.
2/19/16, 11:34 - Mom: what abt 18 Feb?
2/19/16, 11:34 - Cindy L: i forgot to put it back on after shower for that night.
2/19/16, 11:34 - Cindy L: but expect similar results.
2/19/16, 11:35 - Mom: wake up at 4 am?
2/19/16, 11:35 - Cindy L: still do, but i just wake up to turn off lights or play some music and go back to sleep
2/19/16, 11:36 - Cindy L: i wake up earlier around 0730 though
2/19/16, 11:37 - Mom: can u attend most class w/o napping?
2/19/16, 11:37 - Cindy L: yea kind of
2/19/16, 11:37 - Cindy L: but i really really really don't have the motivation to
2/19/16, 11:37 - Cindy L: and i'm late most of the time.
2/19/16, 11:37 - Cindy L: for the 9 am ones
2/19/16, 11:38 - Cindy L: haven't tested lectures, but i did go to one a few weeks ago and even the econ one made me fall asleep
2/19/16, 11:38 - Cindy L: so i just watch them online
2/19/16, 11:39 - Cindy L: i'm always really tired in the morning at some point.
2/19/16, 11:39 - Cindy L: and i just sit there and sleep.
2/19/16, 11:39 - Cindy L: and when i close my eyes its like i go to another world.
2/19/16, 11:40 - Cindy L: it doesn't feel like i'm sleeping and closing my eyes anymore.
2/19/16, 11:40 - Mom: u said rlly tired in the morning, but how about morning and evening?
2/19/16, 11:40 - Cindy L: evening more awake.
2/19/16, 11:41 - Cindy L: morning is generally unproductive and need to sleep again at least once
2/19/16, 11:41 - Cindy L: around 11
2/19/16, 11:41 - Mom: what do u mean by "like going to another world"?
2/19/16, 11:42 - Cindy L: like another reality.
2/19/16, 11:42 - Mom: u mean u were dreaming all the time?
2/19/16, 11:43 - Cindy L: u mean in the dream? yeah
2/19/16, 11:43 - Cindy L: like i forget about this one.
2/19/16, 11:43 - Cindy L: and i get feelings of disorientation when i wake up
2/19/16, 11:43 - Cindy L: especially concerning time.
2/19/16, 11:44 - Cindy L: and space - i.e. i remind myself that i am in london
2/19/16, 11:44 - Mom: where do u think u were when u get up in the morning?
2/19/16, 11:44 - Cindy L: in my room ofc.
2/19/16, 11:44 - Cindy L: but i meant after naps
2/19/16, 11:45 - Cindy L: cuz the naps are most disorienting
2/19/16, 11:45 - Cindy L: and the more times i sleep during the day, the longer the hrs become.
2/19/16, 11:45 - Cindy L: i.e. as in monday and tuesday i napped quite a lot
2/19/16, 11:45 - Cindy L: and i thought the day went by really slowly.
2/19/16, 11:46 - Mom: so u've napped many times and each nap run long hrs?
2/19/16, 11:46 - Cindy L: no
2/19/16, 11:47 - Cindy L: probably like 30-60 mins long each nap
2/19/16, 11:47 - Cindy L: but this is just monday and tuesday.
2/19/16, 11:47 - Mom: how many times u've nap for monday and tuesday?
2/19/16, 11:48 - Cindy L: erm
2/19/16, 11:48 - Cindy L: 3 or 4 times each day?
2/19/16, 11:48 - Cindy L: cuz normally i don't nap
2/19/16, 11:48 - Cindy L: after the morning one
2/19/16, 11:48 - Mom: were monday and tuesday especially cold?
2/19/16, 11:49 - Cindy L: yeah
2/19/16, 11:49 - Cindy L: but the cold only has an effect
2/19/16, 11:49 - Cindy L: if my face has been directly in the cold
2/19/16, 11:49 - Mom: ok, let me sum up my understanding:
2/19/16, 11:50 - Mom: 1) normally u sleep for 7 hrs at night still with 4am wake up
2/19/16, 11:50 - Mom: 2) 1 morning nap at 11 am and no more nap in the afternoon
2/19/16, 11:51 - Mom: 3) and on this monday and tuesday, u've nap 3-4 times @60mins
2/19/16, 11:51 - Mom: 4) no motivation to do things, feeling depressed most of the time
2/19/16, 11:52 - Cindy L: yea, i quit tkd
2/19/16, 11:52 - Cindy L: and most of the time i just sit in my room and read neuro papers
2/19/16, 11:52 - Cindy L: it'd be great if i was reading poli sci papers.
2/19/16, 11:52 - Mom: why, no motivation to do tkd?
2/19/16, 11:53 - Cindy L: dunno i didn't want my skin to be destroyed by sweat again.
2/19/16, 11:53 - Cindy L: so i was waiting for it to heal for a bit first
2/19/16, 11:53 - Mom: don't have any kind of exercise?
2/19/16, 11:53 - Cindy L: and then it turned into a long wait.
2/19/16, 11:53 - Cindy L: then i said i was gonna swim
2/19/16, 11:54 - Mom: when ur reading neuro papers, do u fall into asleep easily?
2/19/16, 11:55 - Cindy L: no
2/19/16, 11:55 - Cindy L: never
2/19/16, 11:55 - Mom: and when ur reading pol sci papers, will u fall asleep easily?
2/19/16, 11:55 - Cindy L: but to be fair, they are rather short
2/19/16, 11:56 - Cindy L: yes
2/19/16, 11:56 - Cindy L: i went to the library to read and i couldn't make it past this one page
2/19/16, 11:56 - Mom: what abt econ papers?
2/19/16, 11:56 - Cindy L: and i ended up sleeping there for the first few hrs
2/19/16, 11:56 - Cindy L: there's no reading for econ
2/19/16, 11:56 - Cindy L: most of the time it's just watching the lectures for me
2/19/16, 11:57 - Mom: what abt maths: can't do maths probs?
2/19/16, 11:58 - Cindy L: well i did maths yesterday. and started feeling sleepy half way, to be fair this is after lunch
2/19/16, 11:59 - Cindy L: my eyes feel generally tired this week for some reason
2/19/16, 11:59 - Cindy L: its like they're very dry and i can't open them properly
2/19/16, 11:59 - Cindy L: so i'm prone to just closing them and i don't realise that i've started remming
2/19/16, 11:59 - Mom: drooping eyes/
2/19/16, 11:59 - Cindy L: its like when u're tired and can't quite open them properly
2/19/16, 12:00 - Mom: is eye drops helpful?
2/19/16, 12:00 - Cindy L: let me try right now
2/19/16, 12:00 - Cindy L: but i don't think so
2/19/16, 12:01 - Mom: can u take a selfie, let me see ur face right now?
2/19/16, 12:01 - Mom: i'm going to cook dinner, will be back in 30 mins
2/19/16, 12:04 - Cindy L: <Media omitted>
2/19/16, 12:11 - Mom: ur face looks so sad
2/19/16, 12:11 - Cindy L: that's boredom and tired
2/19/16, 12:11 - Cindy L: and my face always looks like that
2/19/16, 12:11 - Mom: can u open up ur eyes and look into the camera?
2/19/16, 12:11 - Cindy L: i guess that's why most people say that when they see my face.
2/19/16, 12:13 - Cindy L: <Media omitted>
2/19/16, 12:13 - Mom: this is better even though still looks unhappy
2/19/16, 12:14 - Cindy L: first photo is the don't give a shit photo
2/19/16, 12:16 - Mom: ok, u def has to change ur major cuz u actually not interested in a poli sci subject
2/19/16, 12:17 - Mom: next Q is: do u think taking a break from now on wud be helpful in cbt?
2/19/16, 12:17 - Cindy L: i can't help it. i mean who has time to think about mexicans and trump and free speech when ur brain is not functioning properly
2/19/16, 12:17 - Cindy L: no CBT doesn't work.
2/19/16, 12:18 - Mom: but what else can we do now? even psy drs advise cbt other than med
2/19/16, 12:18 - Cindy L: essentially all i need is to do science - preferably chem
2/19/16, 12:19 - Cindy L: so i can access research facilities
2/19/16, 12:19 - Cindy L: so i can get a lab and drugs
2/19/16, 12:20 - Cindy L: cbt only works for very small percentage of depression suffers
2/19/16, 12:20 - Mom: but at this stage, u didn't hv ib/al chem, no uni wud accept u i guess
2/19/16, 12:20 - Cindy L: yeah that's true
2/19/16, 12:20 - Cindy L: which is why i'm trying to do us transfer
2/19/16, 12:20 - Mom: frankly speaking, med didn't rlly work for depression
2/19/16, 12:20 - Cindy L: but they're so fucking annoying.
2/19/16, 12:21 - Cindy L: tbh we didn't try snri
2/19/16, 12:21 - Mom: u have to deal with it by social contact
2/19/16, 12:21 - Cindy L: do we don't know
2/19/16, 12:21 - Cindy L: i guess.
2/19/16, 12:21 - Cindy L: but meeting people is like playing sims 4 for me
2/19/16, 12:21 - Mom: u need a prescription for snri
2/19/16, 12:21 - Cindy L: tbh so many of my dreams are related to games
2/19/16, 12:22 - Cindy L: like i'm always part of a game
2/19/16, 12:24 - Mom: ok, go to nhs first to see how they say abt ur situation
2/19/16, 12:25 - Cindy L: lol what
2/19/16, 12:25 - Cindy L: if i tell them that, it would be like straight to psychologist for me
2/19/16, 12:25 - Cindy L: and i would have mental health issues on my medical record.
2/19/16, 12:26 - Cindy L: which is probably not a good idea.
2/19/16, 12:26 - Cindy L: i was just planning to ask them about mslt and maybe modafinil
2/19/16, 12:32 - Mom: i don't think they'll prescribe modafinil straight to ur request, but anyway u can ask
2/19/16, 12:32 - Cindy L: yeah
2/19/16, 12:32 - Cindy L: but u know like hypothetically.
2/19/16, 12:34 - Cindy L: so i emailed columbia transfer again and they haven't replied D:
2/19/16, 12:34 - Mom: what did u ask? another form?
2/19/16, 12:35 - Cindy L: no last time i emailed undergrad admissions
2/19/16, 12:35 - Cindy L: and then the transfers person emailed me
2/19/16, 12:35 - Cindy L: so i wrote out my situation in more detail this time.
2/19/16, 12:35 - Cindy L: and she hasn't replied yet.
2/19/16, 12:35 - Mom: just for one more day
2/19/16, 12:36 - Mom: *wait
2/19/16, 12:36 - Cindy L: kk
2/19/16, 12:37 - Cindy L: my plan is to try columbia (probably unlikely though)
2/19/16, 12:37 - Cindy L: and michigan (cuz they have less requirements)
2/19/16, 12:37 - Mom: cc or fu engrg?
2/19/16, 12:38 - Cindy L: cc lah
2/19/16, 12:38 - Mom: will u try ucsd cuz their neuro is good too
2/19/16, 12:39 - Cindy L: no uc transfer is impossible
2/19/16, 12:39 - Mom: k
2/19/16, 12:39 - Cindy L: i am literally just emailing all the unis and asking them
2/19/16, 12:40 - Cindy L: there is a plan b
2/19/16, 12:40 - Cindy L: which is ucl's natural sciences course
2/19/16, 12:40 - Cindy L: basically u go in and do all three sciences for three years.
2/19/16, 12:40 - Mom: can u add that on ucas extra now?
2/19/16, 12:41 - Cindy L: no people say its better to just ask the dept
2/19/16, 12:41 - Mom: ok
2/19/16, 12:41 - Cindy L: so i think that's what i'm gonna do
2/19/16, 12:41 - Cindy L: later.
2/19/16, 12:41 - Cindy L: gonna see if columbia will reply or not
2/19/16, 12:41 - Mom: no requirement for chem/bio?
2/19/16, 12:41 - Cindy L: no just two from chem/bio/phy/math
2/19/16, 12:42 - Cindy L: and i can go into neuroscience with this.
2/19/16, 12:42 - Mom: advise u to ask simultaneously
2/19/16, 12:42 - Cindy L: oh hmm... alright.
2/19/16, 12:42 - Mom: cuz u never whether they have space?
2/19/16, 12:43 - Cindy L: er i'll be an extra candidate anyways....
2/19/16, 12:43 - Mom: yea, so better ask earlier
2/19/16, 12:43 - Cindy L: ok
2/19/16, 12:44 - Cindy L: people say bme is the worst engineering course to take though
2/19/16, 12:44 - Mom: biomed?
2/19/16, 12:44 - Cindy L: yeah
2/19/16, 12:45 - Cindy L: cuz u learn a bit about all forms of engineering
2/19/16, 12:45 - Mom: why? it says 14 candidates for 1 place in 2014?
2/19/16, 12:45 - Cindy L: i meant i saw on an american forum
2/19/16, 12:45 - Cindy L: and ucl courses are always over subscribed
2/19/16, 12:45 - Mom: anyway, i think bme can't be of help for neurosci master
2/19/16, 12:46 - Cindy L: so u think natural sciences would probably be better than bme, right?
2/19/16, 12:46 - Mom: but their ib scores required is 34-38 only
2/19/16, 12:46 - Cindy L: yyea i know so low
2/19/16, 12:46 - Cindy L: but whatevs
2/19/16, 12:46 - Mom: i'll read through natural sci website later
2/19/16, 12:47 - Mom: but def not bme
2/19/16, 12:47 - Cindy L: kk
2/19/16, 12:47 - Cindy L: oh well i accidentally added in imperial bme on my ucas =.=
2/19/16, 12:48 - Cindy L: so anyways...
2/19/16, 12:48 - Cindy L: michigan and amhearst i can do spring transfer
2/19/16, 12:48 - Cindy L: so by then i will have a transcript
2/19/16, 12:48 - Cindy L: yay
2/19/16, 12:49 - Cindy L: but my transcript will suck
2/19/16, 12:50 - Mom: spring transfer? 2016 spring? or 2017?
2/19/16, 12:50 - Cindy L: 2017 spring
2/19/16, 12:50 - Cindy L: like they have two semesters
2/19/16, 12:51 - Mom: why spring transfer? better?
2/19/16, 12:51 - Mom: and what yr to start with?
2/19/16, 12:51 - Cindy L: basically for american unis u can transfer in and out at anytime
2/19/16, 12:51 - Cindy L: really flexible
2/19/16, 12:51 - Mom: i know
2/19/16, 12:52 - Mom: that's why i like us system
2/19/16, 12:52 - Cindy L: so because of this their teaching is also more hands on and 'better
2/19/16, 12:52 - Mom: why not 2016 fall?
2/19/16, 12:52 - Cindy L: cuz 2016 fall i need to apply now
2/19/16, 12:52 - Cindy L: but no transcript for first year right now
2/19/16, 12:52 - Cindy L: i only get a transcript after first year exam
2/19/16, 12:53 - Cindy L: i suspect they will advise me to transfer for next session which is spring 2017
2/19/16, 12:53 - Mom: ofc u don't hv transcript, just tell them ur in the first yr at lse
2/19/16, 12:53 - Cindy L: deadline for that is nov 2016.
2/19/16, 12:54 - Mom: advise u to ask them first b4 making a decision on the intend transfer date
2/19/16, 12:54 - Cindy L: oh yeah ofc
2/19/16, 12:54 - Cindy L: but the fact that i don't have a first year transcript is problem
2/19/16, 12:54 - Cindy L: which is why i'm waiting for columbia's reply
2/19/16, 12:54 - Cindy L: but the transfer person is not replying
2/19/16, 12:56 - Mom: for the high school student applying for first yr uni, they all don't have completed their high school by the time of application, what's difference between these two cases?
2/19/16, 12:56 - Cindy L: one is a first year applicant and the other is a transfer student
2/19/16, 12:56 - Cindy L: transfer student means u transfer into second  yr
2/19/16, 12:57 - Mom: just ask them abt the transcript probs if u want to apply now?
2/19/16, 12:58 - Cindy L: yeah
2/19/16, 12:58 - Cindy L: and then after that there is the issue of reference üò•
2/19/16, 12:58 - Mom: they might ask for other records instead
2/19/16, 12:58 - Cindy L: i see
2/19/16, 12:58 - Cindy L: like extra references üò±
2/19/16, 12:59 - Mom: not extra references
2/19/16, 12:59 - Cindy L: hopefully not
2/19/16, 12:59 - Mom: i think they'll require a certicate of ur registration at lse
2/19/16, 13:00 - Mom: to prove ur currently a student there
2/19/16, 13:00 - Cindy L: oh u think so
2/19/16, 13:00 - Cindy L: there's a common app form for that actually.
2/19/16, 13:00 - Cindy L: there's like a bunch of forms on common app u have to get an official to fill out
2/19/16, 13:01 - Mom: when uni accept international students, they've already cater for uni system difference
2/19/16, 13:01 - Cindy L: ok hopefully.
2/19/16, 13:02 - Mom: us organisations r troublesome, always lots of paper work
2/19/16, 13:02 - Mom: rmb the film abt ppl vanished by papers?
2/19/16, 13:02 - Cindy L: bureaucracy is annoying in general
2/19/16, 13:02 - Cindy L: that's brazil
2/19/16, 13:02 - Mom: american is like that
2/19/16, 13:02 - Cindy L: yep, try getting a  visa lol
2/19/16, 13:03 - Mom: hey, we can hv visa easily cuz we're uk citizen
2/19/16, 13:04 - Mom: don't blame bureaucracy, u can think of it as proper documentation
2/19/16, 13:04 - Cindy L: true that
2/19/16, 13:04 - Cindy L: after taking poli sci
2/19/16, 13:04 - Cindy L: there is nothing i hate more than bureaucracy
2/19/16, 13:04 - Mom: nvm la, just treat it as a lesson
2/19/16, 13:05 - Cindy L: yeah
2/19/16, 13:05 - Mom: but u hv to pay so much for this lesson
2/19/16, 13:05 - Cindy L: did i tell u about cyril?
2/19/16, 13:05 - Mom: who is cyril?
2/19/16, 13:05 - Cindy L: and how he suddenly became a british national
2/19/16, 13:05 - Cindy L: my hs aquaintance
2/19/16, 13:06 - Mom: how do u learn abt he's not a bc?
2/19/16, 13:06 - Cindy L: cuz he's not, he told us his story himself
2/19/16, 13:06 - Mom: he's a hongkonger or big6
2/19/16, 13:06 - Cindy L: hong konger
2/19/16, 13:07 - Cindy L: so he renewed his BNO during the liverpool fiasco
2/19/16, 13:07 - Mom: then he shud hv bno
2/19/16, 13:07 - Cindy L: and when he got it back, they gave him british citizenship
2/19/16, 13:07 - Cindy L: lol
2/19/16, 13:07 - Mom: what?
2/19/16, 13:07 - Cindy L: ok i meant british citizenship
2/19/16, 13:07 - Mom: unbelievable
2/19/16, 13:07 - Mom: did u see his passport?
2/19/16, 13:08 - Cindy L: no he didn't show us, but he said he called up immigration and asked
2/19/16, 13:08 - Cindy L: and they said it was correct
2/19/16, 13:08 - Cindy L: lol
2/19/16, 13:08 - Cindy L: but his passport is apparently a little bit different...
2/19/16, 13:08 - Cindy L: is there a new version?
2/19/16, 13:09 - Mom: the immigration knew they gave out incorrect passport/
2/19/16, 13:09 - Mom: how different?
2/19/16, 13:09 - Mom: is it a eu passport as ours?
2/19/16, 13:09 - Cindy L: like the format is a bit different?
2/19/16, 13:09 - Cindy L: i did see, so not sure
2/19/16, 13:10 - Cindy L: but he's a british citizen now
2/19/16, 13:10 - Cindy L: lol
2/19/16, 13:10 - Mom: the main point is whether he has right of abode at uk and eu countries?
2/19/16, 13:10 - Cindy L: yep
2/19/16, 13:10 - Mom: he has to read through the passport in detail
2/19/16, 13:10 - Cindy L: he's a full british citizen like me and you
2/19/16, 13:11 - Mom: unbelievable????
2/19/16, 13:11 - Cindy L: i know hahaha

2/19/16, 13:25 - Cindy L: k
2/19/16, 13:25 - Cindy L: i think natural sciences is better now
2/19/16, 13:25 - Cindy L: i may have a chance to do med after that.
2/19/16, 13:27 - Mom: i just read that
2/19/16, 13:27 - Mom: i think this is better than bme
2/19/16, 13:27 - Cindy L: yea
2/19/16, 13:28 - Mom: but did u notice they require a 60% pass at the original first yr deg?
2/19/16, 13:28 - Cindy L: for transfer?
2/19/16, 13:29 - Cindy L: or do you mean first year u need to get 60% to pass?
2/19/16, 13:29 - Mom: Students who have completed one year on another degree programme and then wish to transfer into the 1st year of Natural Sciences, will be expected to have a minimum of two science A-Levels at grade A and would also normally be expected to pass the year of the degree programme in which they are currently enrolled with a mark of at least 60%.
2/19/16, 13:29 - Cindy L: i only have one science =.=
2/19/16, 13:29 - Cindy L: so i will be applying as first year i guess?
2/19/16, 13:30 - Cindy L: unless i tell them i have been pretty much guzzling neuro papers
2/19/16, 13:30 - Cindy L: and have a better idea of mental disorders and neurotransmitters than ur average first year student
2/19/16, 13:31 - Cindy L: yea i plan to get about 60%, because i need above 60% to transfer to math as well....
2/19/16, 13:31 - Mom: no, they hv different combination which has different requirement : physics, chemistry, bio and maths
2/19/16, 13:31 - Cindy L: but it says minimum of two science a levels.
2/19/16, 13:32 - Cindy L: or does it mean two a levels from that list?
2/19/16, 13:32 - Mom: http://www.ucl.ac.uk/mathematical-physical-sciences/natural-sciences/core-streams/stream-entry-requirements
2/19/16, 13:32 - Mom: see this
2/19/16, 13:33 - Cindy L: okay whatever, that is a point of debate, so i can send an email and ask about this first.
2/19/16, 13:33 - Cindy L: this is good
2/19/16, 13:33 - Mom: i notice that u've learnt of some debating skill
2/19/16, 13:34 - Cindy L: lol how else can i be able to write 2000 words on absolutely nothing
2/19/16, 13:34 - Mom: at least u learn something

2/19/16, 13:40 - Mom: reasonable person
2/19/16, 13:40 - Cindy L: yeah

2/19/16, 13:42 - Cindy L: and u know what the worst thing is
2/19/16, 13:42 - Cindy L: government people cannot use fucking computers or modern technology.
2/19/16, 13:42 - Cindy L: üò±
2/19/16, 13:43 - Mom: politician just use their mouth to talk, talk and talk

2/19/16, 13:47 - Cindy L: and people only make a big fuss about insignificant things.
2/19/16, 13:47 - Mom: i think there's something wrong with the uk education system
2/19/16, 13:47 - Cindy L: lol yeah
2/19/16, 13:48 - Mom: ppl just don't do according to their interest, i think they just pick the easy one to do at school or unis

2/20/16, 04:06 - Mom: u shud tell them ur grades will be available at the end of the yr when exams were taken by that time, which is lse's exam system
2/20/16, 04:06 - Mom: and once grades available, u'll ask lse to send them the results
2/20/16, 05:15 - Cindy L: Yea that's what I wrote
2/20/16, 05:15 - Cindy L: I'll give a few more days....
2/20/16, 05:17 - Mom: wake up so early?
2/20/16, 05:17 - Mom: u still online at 2am?
2/20/16, 08:41 - Cindy L: I had a weird ass dream yesterday
2/20/16, 08:41 - Cindy L: I went to this digital space which was really cool
2/20/16, 08:41 - Cindy L: I remember it so vividly.
2/20/16, 08:52 - Mom: what did u play inside that digital space?
2/20/16, 11:16 - Cindy L: Team role play
2/20/16, 11:16 - Cindy L: I remember my mouth was bleeding
2/20/16, 11:17 - Cindy L: And there was this horn shaped rock which is important to keep away illness.
2/20/16, 11:28 - Mom: "there was this horn shaped rock which is important to keep away illness" -- don't understand?
2/20/16, 11:44 - Cindy L: Someone said it was important
2/20/16, 11:57 - Mom: do u hv that?
2/20/16, 11:58 - Mom: and why ur mouth was bleeding?
2/20/16, 12:03 - Cindy L: The rock? No, never seen a rock like that before
2/20/16, 12:03 - Cindy L: Mouth? Cuz gums?
2/20/16, 12:04 - Mom: so,  r ur mouth ok now?
2/20/16, 12:04 - Cindy L: I meant in the dream
2/20/16, 12:04 - Cindy L: I kept spitting blood out of my mouth
2/20/16, 12:05 - Cindy L: Cuz my gums were bleeding
2/20/16, 12:05 - Mom: i'm asking ur mouth, u said u felt something growing out from the back of ur teeth, is that alright now?
2/20/16, 12:06 - Cindy L: Yeah it's okay
2/20/16, 12:06 - Cindy L: I can feel the flesh sort of ripping away though
2/20/16, 16:50 - Cindy L: Ah
2/20/16, 16:50 - Cindy L: Something I noticed yesterday
2/20/16, 16:50 - Cindy L: Those "seizures" im having
2/20/16, 16:51 - Cindy L: I think they are daytime episodes of sleep apnea where I also rem
2/20/16, 16:51 - Mom: sleep apnea?
2/20/16, 16:52 - Cindy L: Cuz I woke up from one after lunch feeling like I had been strangled
2/20/16, 16:52 - Cindy L: U know like u can't breathe when u sleep
2/20/16, 16:52 - Cindy L: According to my friend who came down two weeks ago, I also snore...
2/20/16, 16:53 - Cindy L: Or she said breath heavily
2/20/16, 16:54 - Mom: u never had sleep apnea according to ur sleep study, rmb?
2/20/16, 16:54 - Cindy L: So I think I'm probably having sleep apnea when I slip into rem during the day
2/20/16, 16:54 - Cindy L: Er yea I did. Like I mean instances where. I can't breath
2/20/16, 16:54 - Mom: but why seizure?
2/20/16, 16:54 - Cindy L: They feel like seizures to me
2/20/16, 16:54 - Cindy L: But I don't think they r seizures.
2/20/16, 16:56 - Mom: the dec14 sleep study showed no sleep apnea while the jul15 only showed mild SA symptom, rmb?
2/20/16, 16:56 - Cindy L: Yes
2/20/16, 16:56 - Mom: but were u actually shaking during those "seizures"?
2/20/16, 16:56 - Mom: any trembling of limbs or brain waves?
2/20/16, 16:57 - Cindy L: I think they were cases when the muscle looses tone it my limbs start shaking because they can't support my weight anymore
2/20/16, 16:57 - Cindy L: And that is the last thing I remember before I go into rem
2/20/16, 16:57 - Cindy L: So I always remember this 'shaking' feeling afterwards
2/20/16, 16:58 - Mom: hmm
2/20/16, 16:58 - Cindy L: And my head tends to fall back during these episodes
2/20/16, 16:58 - Cindy L: Which makes apnea more likely
2/20/16, 16:58 - Cindy L: So afterwards when I wake up, that 'refreshed' feeling
2/20/16, 16:59 - Cindy L: Is actually from asphyxiation
2/20/16, 16:59 - Cindy L: Which feels like a slight headache to me.
2/20/16, 17:02 - Cindy L: So in these cases
2/20/16, 17:02 - Cindy L: It might not be that I hv apnea
2/20/16, 17:03 - Cindy L: But that the POSITION I end up in when I lose muscle tone makes me suffocate.
2/20/16, 17:05 - Mom: possibly?
2/20/16, 17:05 - Mom: but can't tell whether true or not
2/20/16, 17:06 - Mom: rmb the float-like neck supporter?
2/20/16, 17:06 - Mom: i bought that for u hoping that ur neck wudn't fall backwards to prevent suffocate
2/20/16, 17:07 - Mom: but don't know if that works or not
2/20/16, 17:11 - Cindy L: Er I haven't used it yet
2/20/16, 17:11 - Cindy L: But I kinda stopped watching youtube videos I didnt hv a need for it
2/20/16, 17:12 - Cindy L: Btw I dreamt of a guy called Pauli last night on relation to the rock
2/20/16, 17:12 - Cindy L: And so I just came across a pauli!
2/20/16, 17:13 - Cindy L: He is a quantum physicist
2/20/16, 17:13 - Mom: https://www.google.com.hk/search?q=Pauli&oq=Pauli&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.1137j1j7&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=93&ie=UTF-8
2/20/16, 17:14 - Mom: u even rmb his name?
2/20/16, 17:15 - Cindy L: I never heard of him before.
2/20/16, 17:15 - Cindy L: Maybe morrison mentioned him? But that is ages ago.
2/20/16, 17:17 - Cindy L: Yea no we didn't do subatomic particles.
2/20/16, 17:22 - Mom: hmmm?
2/20/16, 17:33 - Cindy L: Dunno why I dreamt of this guy.
2/20/16, 17:34 - Cindy L: Well to be fair I was in a sort of hologram world. Not sure if it was 3d either since three triangles made a sphere....
2/20/16, 17:37 - Mom: hv u learnt this at the ib physics?
2/20/16, 17:42 - Cindy L: No this is too advanced
2/20/16, 17:43 - Mom: then u shudn't hv learnt of this guy's name
2/20/16, 17:43 - Mom: but how did u dream of his name?
2/20/16, 17:43 - Cindy L: I was talking to this other lady
2/20/16, 17:44 - Cindy L: And I only remember the sentence Pauli was right.
2/20/16, 17:44 - Mom: weird
2/20/16, 17:45 - Cindy L: Yea weird
2/20/16, 17:45 - Cindy L: Though the whole dream was pretty damn weird
2/20/16, 17:46 - Mom: just weird? not scary?
2/20/16, 17:46 - Cindy L: No just weird
2/20/16, 17:47 - Mom: any emotional disturbance after the dream?
2/20/16, 17:47 - Cindy L: No
2/20/16, 17:47 - Cindy L: Anyways I was thinking sleep apnea maybe a cause of weird dreams as well
2/20/16, 17:48 - Cindy L: Cuz ur brain lack oxygen and it'll do crazy shit.
2/20/16, 17:48 - Mom: oh! never knew that!
2/20/16, 17:48 - Mom: i google it
2/21/16, 17:31 - Cindy L: So I've been reviewing what I know. And I think the apnea explanation is probably mmost likely
2/21/16, 17:31 - Cindy L: üòë
2/21/16, 17:52 - Mom: apnea?
2/21/16, 17:52 - Mom: what abt the seizures?
2/21/16, 19:29 - Cindy L: Don't think they r exactly seizures anymore.
2/21/16, 19:52 - Cindy L: I wrote a list to clarify
2/21/16, 19:53 - Cindy L: <Media omitted>
2/21/16, 19:54 - Cindy L: <Media omitted>
2/21/16, 19:55 - Cindy L: Plus eds seems to hv return? Taking more naps after the morning one now.
2/21/16, 23:33 - Mom: do u think more eds r the result of taking theanine supplements?
2/21/16, 23:50 - Mom: When u talk of those eps, do u know their duration? Long or brief only?
2/22/16, 01:23 - Cindy L: No I stopped taking the theanine. I only really took it for two days, cuz everytime I did take it, the cataplexy would become more freq and basically I had to live on the floor for the day or be antisocial.
2/22/16, 01:24 - Cindy L: Oh yea I forgot to put duration.
2/22/16, 01:25 - Cindy L: 1 and 2 u should know, both short cases lasting less than 10 secs really.
2/22/16, 01:27 - Cindy L: Cases of day time rem tend to be like 5 - 10 mins I'm estimating. But it feels very long for me, cuz space-time is different when dreaming, but that's a different issue
2/22/16, 01:27 - Cindy L: Lastly 4 can last up to 30 mins.
2/22/16, 01:28 - Cindy L: 20 - 30 mins
2/22/16, 01:28 - Cindy L: I also took the theanine before I went to Berlin.
2/22/16, 01:29 - Cindy L: Basically Jan was the weird month where I didn't hv much eds for some reason
2/22/16, 01:29 - Cindy L: Now I'm back to being basically a panda, just eat and sleep all day
2/22/16, 01:30 - Cindy L: Because of the this pandas are also on the brink of extinction.
2/22/16, 01:30 - Cindy L: Cry üò≠
2/22/16, 15:14 - Cindy L: Okay it's kinda difficult to record down times of everything by hand.
2/22/16, 15:14 - Cindy L: So Im gonna switch back to whatsapp
2/22/16, 15:15 - Cindy L: Probably napped 5+ times this morning.
2/22/16, 15:15 - Mom: oh
2/22/16, 15:15 - Cindy L: Most productive period was from 9 - abt 1
2/22/16, 15:15 - Cindy L: Where I did math and didn't sleep
2/22/16, 15:15 - Mom: 5+ times?
2/22/16, 15:16 - Mom: for the morning?
2/22/16, 15:16 - Mom: then how come 9-1 productive?
2/22/16, 15:16 - Cindy L: Yes for morning.
2/22/16, 15:16 - Cindy L: I woke up at 7
2/22/16, 15:16 - Cindy L: And then had breakfast
2/22/16, 15:16 - Mom: so nap time must be very short
2/22/16, 15:16 - Cindy L: Took morning nap
2/22/16, 15:16 - Cindy L: And then started working.
2/22/16, 15:17 - Cindy L: Yes nap times very short
2/22/16, 15:17 - Cindy L: But frequent
2/22/16, 15:17 - Cindy L: Like around 5-10 mins
2/22/16, 15:18 - Mom: but u can do maths all the time without napping? in between?
2/22/16, 15:19 - Cindy L: Yea
2/22/16, 15:19 - Cindy L: Well I was like writing notesm
2/22/16, 15:20 - Cindy L: Notes.
2/22/16, 15:23 - Cindy L: For math
2/22/16, 15:25 - Mom: interesting?
2/22/16, 15:26 - Mom: i've just forward an email to ur emal a/c, i've bought ginseng extract for u
2/22/16, 15:34 - Cindy L: Ginseng extract üòí
2/22/16, 15:35 - Cindy L: U should check on examine.com to see if studies show that there's any use before buying supplements....
2/22/16, 15:36 - Cindy L: That's what I learnt after buying so much.
2/22/16, 15:36 - Cindy L: Hahaha.
2/22/16, 15:36 - Mom: ginseng is useful to regulate ur immune system
2/22/16, 15:36 - Cindy L: Okay.
2/22/16, 15:37 - Cindy L: I noticed that after I had the fever in Jan I seemed to improve as well.
2/22/16, 15:37 - Mom: i was thinking that if ur prob is an immune prob, maybe we can try ginseng
2/22/16, 15:37 - Mom: btw, just drink it as ginseng tea
2/22/16, 15:37 - Cindy L: Kk
2/22/16, 15:37 - Mom: what fever?
2/22/16, 15:37 - Cindy L: On new years eve
2/22/16, 15:37 - Cindy L: When I just left.
2/22/16, 15:38 - Mom: that's from hk?
2/22/16, 15:38 - Cindy L: Yeah
2/22/16, 15:38 - Mom: but in what way improved?
2/22/16, 15:38 - Cindy L: After that Jan was the weird month which I didn't hv much eds
2/22/16, 15:39 - Cindy L: Less eds
2/22/16, 15:39 - Mom: see
2/22/16, 15:54 - Cindy L: I also thought abt going to nhs again.
2/22/16, 15:54 - Cindy L: If I went and got diagnosis it would be on my med record right?
2/22/16, 15:55 - Mom: yea
2/22/16, 15:55 - Cindy L: I probably wouldn't be able to get a job after that
2/22/16, 15:55 - Cindy L: Don't even think abt ib
2/22/16, 15:55 - Cindy L: OK so I can't go to nhs.
2/22/16, 15:55 - Cindy L: I was thinking
2/22/16, 15:56 - Cindy L: Could I get a prescription back from hk
2/22/16, 15:56 - Cindy L: For modafinil?
2/22/16, 15:56 - Cindy L: Or do I hv to get the prescription here to get the drug here?
2/22/16, 15:56 - Mom: don't know whether hk dr hv modafinil
2/22/16, 15:57 - Mom: u def won't hv prescription if not issued by dr
2/22/16, 15:57 - Cindy L: No I mean just the prescription so I can buy it here?
2/22/16, 15:57 - Cindy L: Or is that not ppssible
2/22/16, 15:57 - Mom: that's not otc drug, u can't have it otc
2/22/16, 15:57 - Cindy L: So that means I cant buy at a pharmacy with a prescription?
2/22/16, 15:58 - Mom: u can't buy it without a dr's prescription
2/22/16, 15:59 - Cindy L: Do that means the doctor has to stock it and u hv to buy at their clinic or hospital?
2/22/16, 15:59 - Mom: modafinil is psychiatric drug, must hv dr's prescription
2/22/16, 15:59 - Cindy L: Yea.
2/22/16, 15:59 - Cindy L: Well
2/22/16, 15:59 - Cindy L: There is another way.
2/22/16, 15:59 - Mom: no, dr issue prescription and u bring that prescription to dispensary
2/22/16, 16:00 - Cindy L: Yea
2/22/16, 16:00 - Cindy L: That's what I mean
2/22/16, 16:00 - Mom: hk public hospital doesn't hv modafinil
2/22/16, 16:00 - Cindy L: I know.
2/22/16, 16:00 - Cindy L: Which sucks.
2/22/16, 16:00 - Cindy L: Only the Prof has it right.
2/22/16, 16:01 - Mom: the only way i can think of is from the psy prof at pwh private clinic
2/22/16, 16:01 - Cindy L: The only other place I know is sun pharma
2/22/16, 16:01 - Mom: probably
2/22/16, 16:01 - Mom: u def can't buy it otc
2/22/16, 16:01 - Cindy L: Which is in India and quite dodgy
2/22/16, 16:02 - Mom: india - no way, like china
2/22/16, 16:02 - Cindy L: Yrah
2/22/16, 16:02 - Cindy L: So okay
2/22/16, 16:02 - Cindy L: Nvm
2/22/16, 16:03 - Mom: perhaps try ginseng first, to see if that helps
2/22/16, 16:03 - Cindy L: OK.
2/22/16, 16:03 - Cindy L: It's reasonable to not want it on ur med record right?
2/22/16, 16:04 - Mom: if we can control it, better to keep at our side
2/22/16, 16:04 - Cindy L: OK but I'm writing the transfer supplement
2/22/16, 16:04 - Cindy L: Do I let them know I have narco?
2/22/16, 16:04 - Mom: when that's in ur med record, even if u want to buy other health insurance, that might be a prob
2/22/16, 16:05 - Mom: can u just mention personal health prob, or even sleep prob instead of clearly mention the name narco
2/22/16, 16:06 - Mom: besides, if u mention narco, they might request confirmation from dr
2/22/16, 16:06 - Cindy L: Right. Okay.
2/22/16, 16:06 - Mom: rmb the email i wrote to sci po abt ur withdrawal?
2/22/16, 16:07 - Cindy L: Yea.
2/22/16, 16:07 - Cindy L: But how am I suppose to make that convincing.
2/22/16, 16:08 - Mom: btw, if u tell them that ur narco but ur not on med and even can't access med now, it'll be strange to them
2/22/16, 16:08 - Cindy L: Though I also think unis would hv reservations abt admitting a cataplectic student
2/22/16, 16:08 - Cindy L: Yea that's true
2/22/16, 16:08 - Cindy L: Hmmm...
2/22/16, 16:09 - Cindy L: But this is the best reason I can use for transfer as well.
2/22/16, 16:09 - Mom: u mention ur sleep prob right? u can also cite ur experience of friends' case telling them that brain prob is worth study
2/22/16, 16:10 - Cindy L: Alright.
2/22/16, 16:10 - Cindy L: So I shouldn't mention personal exp
2/22/16, 16:10 - Cindy L: Damn.
2/22/16, 16:11 - Mom: i was thinking if u disclose ur cataplectic events, those uni might even ask more for ur ability to complete the uni course? right?
2/22/16, 16:11 - Cindy L: Yea..
2/22/16, 16:11 - Cindy L: But cataplectic people can drive too.
2/22/16, 16:12 - Mom: then u might face another prob to convince them that u can do it
2/22/16, 16:12 - Mom: they hv to pass special test as well
2/22/16, 16:12 - Mom: and be confirmed by a dr
2/22/16, 16:12 - Cindy L: OK so all roads lead to essentially a scar on my med record.
2/22/16, 16:12 - Mom: ppl won't just listen to what u said and endorse their approval
2/22/16, 16:13 - Cindy L: Unless I become a doctor myself, then my days of worrying abt med record would be over.
2/22/16, 16:13 - Cindy L: Hahahaha
2/22/16, 16:14 - Mom: cuz u've to convince ppl that u can do it, how ppl see ur ability, it's difficult to control
2/22/16, 16:15 - Cindy L: Hai I made a document called life options yesterday.
2/22/16, 16:15 - Mom: what's it?
2/22/16, 16:15 - Cindy L: All the possible routes I can take now and where they lead to in terms of my illness and possibility of a career.
2/22/16, 16:16 - Mom: result?
2/22/16, 16:16 - Cindy L: Conclusion: narcolepsy and career prospects are mutually exclusive.
2/22/16, 16:16 - Cindy L: Sigh.
2/22/16, 16:17 - Mom: so give up now?
2/22/16, 16:17 - Cindy L: I dunno
2/22/16, 16:17 - Cindy L: So hard
2/22/16, 16:18 - Mom: that's why i'm still suspicious of the diagnosis
2/22/16, 16:19 - Mom: the way those dr made the diagnosis if too rush and simple
2/22/16, 16:19 - Mom: *is
2/22/16, 16:23 - Mom: u just said u've improvement after the jan fever, how do we know that u can't recover after another incident?
2/22/16, 16:36 - Cindy L: Yea I guess
2/22/16, 16:37 - Cindy L: If u imagine a very tall mountain.
2/22/16, 16:38 - Cindy L: Where the base is depression and the sky is happiness...
2/22/16, 16:39 - Cindy L: I am always on the tip of mountain
2/22/16, 16:39 - Cindy L: Where I can never quite reach the sky and always trying to avoid falling down.
2/22/16, 16:43 - Cindy L: Aww that is beautiful, I should be a writer üòÑ
2/22/16, 16:47 - Mom: so u hv a career now
2/22/16, 16:51 - Mom: tbh, nobody can reach the sky, everybody has its own prob, they just won't tell anybody
2/22/16, 16:52 - Mom: just keep calm and be pragmatic
2/22/16, 16:59 - Cindy L: OK true that
2/22/16, 16:59 - Mom: üí™
2/22/16, 17:53 - Cindy L: So I've discovered the existence of summer courses.
2/22/16, 17:57 - Mom: jap?
2/22/16, 17:58 - Cindy L: No as in Columbia summer courses
2/22/16, 17:58 - Mom: what subj?
2/22/16, 17:58 - Cindy L: There's a lot
2/22/16, 17:59 - Mom: so what's ur plan?
2/22/16, 17:59 - Cindy L: I was thinking would it be better to take one of these and then use as transfer...
2/22/16, 18:01 - Mom: wonder if this work?
2/22/16, 18:01 - Cindy L: But Columbia says u can't transfer in second yr
2/22/16, 18:01 - Cindy L: So I better do it now.
2/22/16, 18:01 - Mom: ofc now
2/22/16, 19:03 - Cindy L: Ok can I mention a cataplectic friend?
2/22/16, 19:04 - Cindy L: It's quite difficult to explain the sudden switch.
2/22/16, 19:15 - Cindy L: Mopps
2/22/16, 19:16 - Cindy L: have you seen this btw?
2/22/16, 19:16 - Cindy L: https://med.stanford.edu/narcolepsy/KLS.html
2/22/16, 19:16 - Cindy L: this looks suspicious like my case.....
2/22/16, 19:17 - Mom: Not yet
2/22/16, 19:23 - Cindy L: associated with episodic hypersomnolence, compulsive overeating, lack of sexual inhibition, and personality change, and most often, it represents a benign and self-limited entity and does not warrant extensive investigation or treatment. Female affection of the disease is very rare.
2/22/16, 19:23 - Mom: I read abt kls b4 but I don't think it lookslike urs
2/22/16, 19:23 - Cindy L: oh
2/22/16, 19:23 - Cindy L: well i can mail them my blood and test my genes.
2/22/16, 19:24 - Mom: U want to participate
2/22/16, 19:24 - Mom: ?
2/22/16, 19:24 - Cindy L: yah
2/22/16, 19:24 - Cindy L: i wanna know if i have the hla gene mutation.
2/22/16, 19:24 - Cindy L: apparently 20% of the population have it though
2/22/16, 19:37 - Mom: I know u rlly want to test ur genes, but better not to disclose ur diagnosis of narcolepsy in hk I advise
2/22/16, 19:37 - Cindy L: but maybe i can do it anonymously.
2/22/16, 19:38 - Cindy L: u just have to fill out questionnaire
2/22/16, 19:39 - Mom: they let u do it without disclosing names?
2/22/16, 19:39 - Cindy L: yea its for research
2/22/16, 19:39 - Cindy L: im sure u can request.
2/22/16, 19:39 - Cindy L: plus narco patients are so rare i bet they are dying for samples.
2/22/16, 19:40 - Cindy L: i'll just mail them my blood from here.
2/22/16, 19:40 - Mom: k
2/22/16, 23:26 - Cindy L: So I finally found the answer to my problems.
2/22/16, 23:26 - Cindy L: I need an orexin nasal spray
2/22/16, 23:26 - Cindy L: A lifetime supply of orexin.
2/22/16, 23:27 - Cindy L: Unfortunately its expensive as shit.
2/22/16, 23:27 - Cindy L: Cuz its a peptide
2/22/16, 23:27 - Cindy L: Like insulin.
2/22/16, 23:27 - Cindy L: Fucccck
2/22/16, 23:28 - Cindy L: So now I need money to build a bioreactor to produce orexin üôÅ
2/22/16, 23:29 - Cindy L: The big pharmas invented a bloody orexin receptor antagonist but not an agonist cuz its not financially viable.
2/22/16, 23:29 - Cindy L: ‚òπ
2/22/16, 23:30 - Mom: where did u find info?
2/22/16, 23:31 - Cindy L: There's a lecturer on YouTube from Jerry Siegel and abt halfway he mentions a study done on rats
2/22/16, 23:32 - Cindy L: Where they gave them orexin by nasal
2/22/16, 23:32 - Cindy L: And that was very effective in promoting alertness
2/22/16, 23:33 - Cindy L: And then the forums are  basically full of people look for an orexin nasal spray
2/22/16, 23:34 - Mom: then u realise that narco is not 1:200000 but 1:2000
2/22/16, 23:38 - Cindy L: But pharmas are not producing this drug even though there are three studies which confirms that it works.
2/22/16, 23:39 - Cindy L: Cuz its expensive as fuck and they aren't gonna make money off it.
2/22/16, 23:39 - Cindy L: Great
2/22/16, 23:39 - Cindy L: At the end of the day, all down to econ.
2/22/16, 23:43 - Cindy L: Anyways
2/22/16, 23:43 - Mom: Lol
2/22/16, 23:44 - Cindy L: So now I need to learn how to build a bioreactor
2/22/16, 23:44 - Cindy L: And make plasmids secrete orexin.
2/22/16, 23:45 - Cindy L: And also write up a business plan to fund my l√†b.
2/22/16, 23:45 - Cindy L: Weep
2/22/16, 23:45 - Mom: It seems lots of making $ opportunity
2/22/16, 23:46 - Cindy L: Not really.
2/22/16, 23:46 - Cindy L: U might as well going into recycling
2/22/16, 23:47 - Cindy L: Only narcoleptics need orexin
2/22/16, 23:47 - Cindy L: And there's too little customers.
2/22/16, 23:48 - Cindy L: if i could make a little homemade bioreactor that would be great.
2/22/16, 23:48 - Mom: But there might be similar customer
2/22/16, 23:50 - Cindy L: yeah one or two.
2/22/16, 23:50 - Cindy L: ok now i really need to take biochem
2/23/16, 10:18 - Cindy L: So suddenly
2/23/16, 10:18 - Cindy L: All my cataplexy symptoms seem to hv improve by tenfold.
2/23/16, 10:18 - Cindy L: I dunno why
2/23/16, 10:21 - Cindy L: Either I didn't eat muh yesterday
2/23/16, 10:22 - Cindy L: Or I took 400mg of 5htp
2/23/16, 10:31 - Mom: once?
2/23/16, 11:27 - Cindy L: Yesterday yeah
2/23/16, 11:27 - Cindy L: I watched a funny video
2/23/16, 11:29 - Cindy L: And nothing seems to hv happened....
2/23/16, 11:29 - Cindy L: I'm going on the street now
2/23/16, 11:29 - Cindy L: To see
2/23/16, 11:42 - Mom: be careful
2/23/16, 11:44 - Cindy L: Why...?
2/23/16, 11:45 - Mom: i'm afraid u wud be too emotional
2/23/16, 11:54 - Cindy L: Oh u mean with the serotonin.
2/23/16, 11:55 - Cindy L: I actually feel great today so far.
2/23/16, 11:55 - Mom: yea
2/23/16, 11:55 - Cindy L: I mean no cataplexy so far....
2/23/16, 11:55 - Mom: great but what actually have u done or taken yesterday?
2/23/16, 11:56 - Cindy L: Just took 2 capsules of 5htp
2/23/16, 11:56 - Mom: total 400mg?
2/23/16, 11:56 - Cindy L: Yea
2/23/16, 11:56 - Cindy L: Before I was taking them one in the morning and one at night.
2/23/16, 11:56 - Mom: but is this the first time u took 400mg?
2/23/16, 11:57 - Cindy L: At the same time yeah
2/23/16, 11:57 - Cindy L: I think it needed a higher dosage to be metabolised, to significantly increase serotonin lvls.
2/23/16, 11:58 - Mom: but is this a safety level?
2/23/16, 11:59 - Cindy L: Yea
2/23/16, 11:59 - Cindy L: Rec use is like 1000mg +
2/23/16, 11:59 - Mom: still hv to watch the safety intake level?
2/23/16, 12:00 - Mom: what's the name of the 5htp u took?
2/23/16, 12:01 - Cindy L: All natural supplies
2/23/16, 12:02 - Mom: no weird dream yesterday?
2/23/16, 12:02 - Cindy L: No
2/23/16, 12:02 - Mom: how's ur sleep last night? still hv 4am wake up?
2/23/16, 12:02 - Cindy L: Erm no
2/23/16, 12:02 - Cindy L: I dont think so
2/23/16, 12:03 - Cindy L: But I slept on the wrong pillow
2/23/16, 12:03 - Cindy L: So that was annoying.
2/23/16, 12:03 - Mom: wrong pillow?
2/23/16, 12:04 - Mom: ok, just keep watching ur body's response for sometime
2/23/16, 12:53 - Cindy L: OK I just went to sains
2/23/16, 12:53 - Cindy L: Only mild cases were reduced.
2/23/16, 12:54 - Cindy L: Surprise still seems to be a stimulus
2/23/16, 12:55 - Cindy L: To be fair I don't think I've spoken to anybody for past four days....
2/23/16, 12:55 - Mom: told u not to be too emotional
2/23/16, 12:55 - Mom: keep calm
2/23/16, 12:56 - Cindy L: I am calm
2/23/16, 12:56 - Cindy L: Just thought I was cured though.
2/23/16, 12:57 - Mom: what time u took those 5htp yesterday?
2/23/16, 12:57 - Cindy L: It's probably the calorie restriction which is helping me stay awake then.
2/23/16, 12:57 - Cindy L: Around 6
2/23/16, 12:57 - Cindy L: Pm
2/23/16, 12:57 - Mom: then how much u ate yesterday?
2/23/16, 12:57 - Cindy L: Not a lot
2/23/16, 12:58 - Cindy L: Around 50 g of oats
2/23/16, 12:58 - Cindy L: Had  serving of soba
2/23/16, 12:58 - Cindy L: Four crab sticks
2/23/16, 12:59 - Cindy L: And sandwiches which I made from the left over.
2/23/16, 12:59 - Mom: then keep this menu for couple of days to see if it's the effect of diet or 5htp
2/23/16, 13:00 - Mom: perhaps ur situation is improving over time but we just don't notice
2/23/16, 13:00 - Mom: and the recovery is slow, so we hv to wait and see result
2/23/16, 13:01 - Cindy L: No. Def no self recovery
2/23/16, 13:01 - Mom: so u think that's the effect of 5htp?
2/23/16, 13:02 - Cindy L: Cuz I've been logging down everything.
2/23/16, 13:03 - Mom: so u took 400mg 5htp and watch a funny video afterwards?
2/23/16, 13:03 - Cindy L: Nooo
2/23/16, 13:03 - Cindy L: I took 2 caps 5htp yesterday around 6pm
2/23/16, 13:03 - Mom: what time u watched that video?
2/23/16, 13:04 - Cindy L: And this morning I woke up noticed that I was less tired than usual and I tried watching a few funny videos to see what my response would be
2/23/16, 13:04 - Cindy L: I.e. if my right eye wasn't in pain I could have skipped morning  nap
2/23/16, 13:05 - Mom: did u nap this morning?
2/23/16, 13:05 - Cindy L: Yes voluntarily.
2/23/16, 13:05 - Cindy L: Now I'm gonna attempt reading all those fucking gv papers
2/23/16, 13:05 - Mom: kk
2/23/16, 13:06 - Cindy L: In conclusion seems like the serotonin has an effect on eds
2/23/16, 13:06 - Cindy L: If taken at high enough dosage
2/23/16, 13:07 - Cindy L: Which is pretty normal and reasonble
2/23/16, 13:07 - Cindy L: So I think its safe so far.
2/23/16, 13:07 - Mom: but mind u that those oral taken 5htp actually can't cross the bbb
2/23/16, 13:08 - Cindy L: Nooo
2/23/16, 13:08 - Mom: yea
2/23/16, 13:08 - Cindy L: 5htp is the precursor
2/23/16, 13:08 - Cindy L: I think
2/23/16, 13:09 - Cindy L: Once it gets metabolised it can pass.
2/23/16, 13:09 - Mom: nvm, u can still try and see its effect first
2/23/16, 13:09 - Mom: just watch out for any abnormalities
2/23/16, 13:10 - Cindy L: Ah it's a metabolic intermitter
2/23/16, 13:11 - Cindy L: Whatever that means.
2/23/16, 13:11 - Cindy L: Might as well self learn biochem at this rate.
2/23/16, 13:12 - Mom: but one thing i was puzzled that u did hv taken that 5htp b4, but only resulted in weird dreams?
2/23/16, 13:12 - Mom: this means that those med did affect ur body
2/23/16, 13:13 - Cindy L: Then in this case I think the dreams were not caused by the 5htp
2/23/16, 13:13 - Cindy L: Because I can get strange dreams in general
2/23/16, 13:13 - Mom: yea, rlly strange
2/23/16, 13:13 - Cindy L: Anyways it's not a psychoactive drug
2/23/16, 13:14 - Cindy L: It doesn't excite the 5ht2a receptors, which are the ones responsible for hallucinations
2/23/16, 13:14 - Cindy L: It just promotes production of serotonin
2/23/16, 14:29 - Cindy L: So I finally got a reply from columbia
2/23/16, 14:30 - Cindy L: They said transfers are only for us style colleges
2/23/16, 14:30 - Cindy L: And said I had to apply as first yr
2/23/16, 14:30 - Cindy L: Which has passed already
2/23/16, 14:30 - Mom: i thought they replied already
2/23/16, 14:30 - Cindy L: So they advised me to apply for gs.
2/23/16, 14:30 - Cindy L: No I emailed transfers
2/23/16, 14:31 - Cindy L: And clarified my situation
2/23/16, 14:31 - Cindy L: I also emailed cmu
2/23/16, 14:32 - Mom: so what do u think now?
2/23/16, 14:32 - Mom: still go ahead with cc or gs?
2/23/16, 14:32 - Cindy L: No don't apply Columbia
2/23/16, 14:33 - Mom: why?
2/23/16, 14:33 - Cindy L: Cuz they said they weren't gonna consider already.
2/23/16, 14:33 - Cindy L: And if GS I might as well stay here
2/23/16, 14:34 - Cindy L: Gonna try Stanford and Cornell next
2/23/16, 14:34 - Cindy L: Cornell is transfer friendly
2/23/16, 14:34 - Cindy L: And then NYU I suppose.
2/23/16, 14:37 - Mom: michigan?
2/23/16, 14:38 - Cindy L: Michigan better later after I get a transcript.
2/23/16, 14:39 - Mom: then u won't be catching up the fall transfer?
2/23/16, 14:40 - Cindy L: Yeah but state unis literally admit based on GPA.
2/23/16, 14:41 - Cindy L: Like shit tons of people transfer so they r gonna spend abt as much time reading my app as the time I spend reading my gv readings
2/23/16, 15:08 - Mom: well, i read through their website, columbia does accept international transfer student and i don't understand why they said they accept only transfer from us-style uni?
2/23/16, 15:09 - Mom: i also read transfer to cornell which also requires mid-term report in common application?
2/23/16, 15:10 - Mom: i think same for cmu and others if u're going through the common app process
2/23/16, 15:16 - Mom: one more thing is the deadline, u just hv abt one week to complete the app material for transfer
2/23/16, 15:23 - Mom: http://transferweb.com/stats/transfer-acceptance-rates/#.Vsx5Q_mLTZ4
2/23/16, 16:52 - Cindy L: I know
2/23/16, 16:52 - Cindy L: I'm thinking whether I should just switch to math here.
2/23/16, 16:53 - Cindy L: I hv so much shit this week I havent even talked to a single person
2/23/16, 16:53 - Mom: why?
2/23/16, 16:53 - Mom: not even ur flatmate?
2/23/16, 16:55 - Mom: how's ur day today? more energy? tired?
2/23/16, 17:01 - Cindy L: Same as usual
2/23/16, 17:01 - Cindy L: Just that perk in the morning where I thought I was cured.
2/23/16, 17:01 - Cindy L: Anyways I don't even know what to do now really
2/23/16, 17:02 - Cindy L: I can't read anything more than 10 pages
2/23/16, 17:02 - Mom: so, when u tried reading gv100 materials in the afternoon, u just fell asleep for long duration?
2/23/16, 17:03 - Cindy L: I read abt 6 pages
2/23/16, 17:03 - Cindy L: And then I slip in and out
2/23/16, 17:03 - Cindy L: So none of the words make sense
2/23/16, 17:04 - Cindy L: And I have to read it again...
2/23/16, 17:04 - Mom: for the whole afternoon? slipping in and out of sleep state?
2/23/16, 17:05 - Mom: if this is the case, why not just take nap for like 20mins?
2/23/16, 17:05 - Mom: and do the reading again?
2/23/16, 17:06 - Cindy L: Cuz Im not aware that I'm doing it
2/23/16, 17:06 - Cindy L: Yea pretty much
2/23/16, 17:06 - Cindy L: That's why I write summary notes in the margins
2/23/16, 17:06 - Cindy L: But the printer wouldnt fucking work for me todya
2/23/16, 17:07 - Cindy L: I should just bought a printer for ¬£50
2/23/16, 17:08 - Mom: which is that printer belongs to? lse? high holborn dorm?
2/23/16, 17:08 - Cindy L: Anyways I can't read any of it
2/23/16, 17:08 - Cindy L: Lse printers
2/23/16, 17:08 - Cindy L: at least I can do math
2/23/16, 17:08 - Cindy L: But ur right that the lse math Dept is retarded
2/23/16, 17:08 - Cindy L: Everything is so freaking verbose and wordy
2/23/16, 17:09 - Cindy L: This is math for God's sake
2/23/16, 17:09 - Cindy L: But at least theres a lot of math resources online
2/23/16, 17:10 - Mom: i was thinking if u were to redo the first yr, better do a relevant deg
2/23/16, 17:10 - Cindy L: Yes I think so too
2/23/16, 17:10 - Cindy L: But going to us is proving to be very difficult.
2/23/16, 17:12 - Mom: but i think u shud also try, filling in the common app as usual in applying for the first yr deg
2/23/16, 17:12 - Cindy L: Okay but I hv tons of gaps? And no references?
2/23/16, 17:13 - Cindy L: And I'll have to apply for fall 2017
2/23/16, 17:13 - Mom: no, u state ur current uni, reference --> go ask for high school teachers
2/23/16, 17:13 - Cindy L: By that time I might as well finish my current degree
2/23/16, 17:13 - Mom: fall 2016
2/23/16, 17:14 - Cindy L: It's pass the deadlines already
2/23/16, 17:14 - Mom: for international transfer
2/23/16, 17:14 - Mom: march 1, 2016
2/23/16, 17:14 - Mom: i mean just apply for transfer for fall 2016
2/23/16, 17:15 - Cindy L: Yea.
2/23/16, 17:15 - Mom: u still hv to apply through common app filling everything in the common application form and fill in ur current lse uni as well
2/23/16, 17:16 - Cindy L: Yea I am applying for international transfer
2/23/16, 17:16 - Mom: and send them documents upto completion of ib
2/23/16, 17:16 - Cindy L: That's exactly what I'm doing.
2/23/16, 17:16 - Mom: actually everything is the same as last yr except u add the lse info
2/23/16, 17:16 - Cindy L: Yes.
2/23/16, 17:17 - Mom: and supplement writing is for transfer
2/23/16, 17:19 - Mom: pick cornell, u of mich, cmu if u like
2/23/16, 17:20 - Mom: why haven't talked to anybody for 4 days? what happen on ur side?
2/23/16, 17:20 - Mom: take 5htp again this week to see result, ok?
2/23/16, 17:21 - Mom: did u add ucl natural science as extra in ucas application?
2/23/16, 17:21 - Cindy L: No I cant
2/23/16, 17:22 - Cindy L: Gotta wait for imperial to reject me again cuz I stupidly added that first and realise u can only add them one at a time
2/23/16, 17:22 - Cindy L: And abt ucl argrhh
2/23/16, 17:22 - Cindy L: I'll talk to u later
2/23/16, 17:22 - Cindy L: My phone is running out of juice
2/23/16, 17:23 - Cindy L: This is why I created a life options document.
2/23/16, 17:23 - Mom: not in ur dorm now?
2/23/16, 17:23 - Cindy L: No
2/23/16, 17:23 - Cindy L: I was in the library battling the printer
2/23/16, 17:23 - Mom: where?
2/23/16, 17:23 - Mom: oh
2/23/16, 17:24 - Mom: try another printer la
2/23/16, 17:29 - Mom: ru still taking the tartcherry supplements, if yea quit it, not to take together with 5htp
2/23/16, 21:33 - Cindy L: dude
2/23/16, 21:33 - Cindy L: the tartcherry
2/23/16, 21:33 - Cindy L: is like
2/23/16, 21:33 - Cindy L: candy
2/23/16, 23:10 - Mom: How's ur strength at evening?
2/23/16, 23:16 - Cindy L: normal
2/23/16, 23:16 - Cindy L: everything back to same old regular shittyness
2/23/16, 23:17 - Cindy L: i need to stop hanging out with my high school friends, they make me miss high school. :(
2/23/16, 23:37 - Mom: i mean can u do stuff at evening?
2/23/16, 23:37 - Cindy L: yeah
2/23/16, 23:37 - Cindy L: i finished reading that monstrous reading.
2/23/16, 23:37 - Cindy L: 5 to go....
2/24/16, 07:44 - Mom: Hi, wake up?
2/24/16, 09:28 - Mom: https://hk.news.yahoo.com/%E5%8F%AA%E5%90%83%E9%A6%AC%E9%88%B4%E8%96%AF%E5%BA%A6%E6%97%A5-%E6%BE%B3%E6%B4%B2%E7%94%B7%E7%94%A9%E8%82%8917%E5%85%AC%E6%96%A4-120506718.html
2/24/16, 09:33 - Cindy L: üòÖ
2/24/16, 09:34 - Cindy L: üëè I appauld this guy
2/24/16, 09:34 - Mom: u can try la to trim ur body
2/24/16, 09:34 - Mom: how's ur sleep yesterday?
2/24/16, 09:34 - Cindy L: So where does he get this vitamins from
2/24/16, 09:35 - Mom: potatoes
2/24/16, 09:35 - Cindy L: Potatoes don't supply all vitamins
2/24/16, 09:35 - Cindy L: And how bought protein?
2/24/16, 09:35 - Cindy L: U need protein to repair tissue
2/24/16, 09:36 - Mom: he has lots of fat which can be burnt down into protein
2/24/16, 09:36 - Cindy L: üòí
2/24/16, 09:36 - Cindy L: That news looks dodgy
2/24/16, 09:37 - Cindy L: Hello?
2/24/16, 09:37 - Mom: yea
2/24/16, 09:37 - Mom: what?
2/24/16, 09:37 - Cindy L: So I came up with another solution
2/24/16, 09:37 - Cindy L: For my transfer plans.
2/24/16, 09:37 - Mom: u hv so many plans
2/24/16, 09:38 - Cindy L: Cuz America is annoying.
2/24/16, 09:38 - Cindy L: College admissions is like a maze
2/24/16, 09:38 - Cindy L: And srsly if they accept transfers all the time, they might as well just be offering short courses
2/24/16, 09:39 - Mom: hey, i read the ucas details, u still can add another 3 choice now, only those choice be considered as late application
2/24/16, 09:39 - Cindy L: Yep
2/24/16, 09:39 - Cindy L: But u must add them one at a time.
2/24/16, 09:40 - Mom: no, i didn't find it from ucas's info
2/24/16, 09:40 - Cindy L: And I need to ask Dept if they still hv space before I apply
2/24/16, 09:40 - Cindy L: Dude I'm in the process
2/24/16, 09:40 - Cindy L: They don't let me add OK?
2/24/16, 09:40 - Mom: ok
2/24/16, 09:40 - Cindy L: Anyhow.
2/24/16, 09:40 - Cindy L: So I'm missing mainly chem
2/24/16, 09:41 - Mom: but can u cancel ur application(biomed engrg) of imperial now?
2/24/16, 09:41 - Cindy L: Berkeley offers summer courses for like every single discipline.
2/24/16, 09:41 - Mom: sigh, it's the fault of film studies
2/24/16, 09:42 - Mom: but u can't take those summer courses for transfer
2/24/16, 09:42 - Cindy L: No listen.
2/24/16, 09:42 - Cindy L: Anyways they hv chem, bio, molecular chem, etc.
2/24/16, 09:43 - Cindy L: And I can get credits for doing those
2/24/16, 09:43 - Mom: do they count on these credits?
2/24/16, 09:43 - Cindy L: Yes
2/24/16, 09:43 - Mom: great
2/24/16, 09:43 - Cindy L: They even say how many credits they are worth
2/24/16, 09:43 - Cindy L: And I think if I've done those
2/24/16, 09:44 - Cindy L: With actual grades in my first year transcript
2/24/16, 09:44 - Mom: then u want to do summer course one by one? and use them to apply graduate school for neurosci?
2/24/16, 09:44 - Cindy L: Yea. Pretty much.
2/24/16, 09:45 - Cindy L: I mean grad school requirement is just that u hv done certain Chen courses
2/24/16, 09:45 - Mom: so ur plan is staying at lse for the time being and take additional chem/molecular bio during summer?
2/24/16, 09:46 - Cindy L: I think that is a doable plan
2/24/16, 09:46 - Cindy L: And if I've got actual credits, and first yr grades, it's much easier to do a spring transfer.
2/24/16, 09:47 - Cindy L: Because they will hv a GPA to base on.
2/24/16, 09:47 - Cindy L: I mean they mainly accept based on GPA anyways.
2/24/16, 09:47 - Mom: so u mean still do transfer by later?
2/24/16, 09:47 - Mom: but lse don't hv GPA
2/24/16, 09:47 - Cindy L: Yea but I still hv grades
2/24/16, 09:48 - Cindy L: And they recalculate GPA anyways so it doesn't matter
2/24/16, 09:49 - Mom: well, actually the first yr transcript at lse isn't that important if ur applying this fall 2016 cuz they're international uni, they must know there're different reporting system at different countries if they're willing to consider international student trf
2/24/16, 09:50 - Cindy L: Yes but they need to know u are getting good grades at ur current uni
2/24/16, 09:50 - Cindy L: That's why u need grades
2/24/16, 09:51 - Mom: i wud say u can still submit all ur high skl transcript and external exam results, and that's enough
2/24/16, 09:51 - Cindy L: Well I'm asking them cuz what u think is not what they think
2/24/16, 09:52 - Cindy L: And all I can submit for transcript right now is a blank sheet of paper.
2/24/16, 09:52 - Mom: i'm afraid that they won't accept international trf from 2nd yr student like columbia
2/24/16, 09:52 - Cindy L: No u can transfer anytime....
2/24/16, 09:53 - Cindy L: And Columbia never accepted international trf students in the first place....
2/24/16, 09:53 - Cindy L: U had to be studying in a US style uni
2/24/16, 09:53 - Cindy L: And the lse is so British u can't get more brit
2/24/16, 09:54 - Cindy L: At least ucl has gives credits as well
2/24/16, 09:54 - Mom: To apply from abroad if your college is not US-style as defined above, you must apply as a first-year student only in your first year of study. If you have begun your second year of study or beyond, you are no longer eligible to apply to Columbia as an undergraduate.
2/24/16, 09:54 - Mom: from columbia website
2/24/16, 09:54 - Cindy L: Yes I know
2/24/16, 09:54 - Mom: so why say they don't accept international trf?
2/24/16, 09:55 - Cindy L: Just give up on Columbia already it's not gonna happen
2/24/16, 09:55 - Cindy L: Time to move on
2/24/16, 09:55 - Mom: we're not talking abt applying to columbia, but i just worry if other uni is the same
2/24/16, 09:55 - Cindy L: I say I should try and make my case to Stanford.
2/24/16, 09:56 - Mom: bu stanford's transfer acceptance rate is soooooo low
2/24/16, 09:56 - Cindy L: Stanford has a weird system.
2/24/16, 09:56 - Cindy L: I'll disclose my condition just to Stanford
2/24/16, 09:57 - Cindy L: Cuz they r leading med school for  investigation in narco right?
2/24/16, 09:57 - Mom: errr, not so sure?
2/24/16, 09:57 - Cindy L: Yep they r
2/24/16, 09:57 - Mom: they discovered the orexin
2/24/16, 09:57 - Cindy L: See
2/24/16, 09:58 - Cindy L: Look if u applying for ivy, u need a bargaining chip
2/24/16, 09:58 - Mom: sorry, can't agree that narco case is a bargaining chip
2/24/16, 09:59 - Cindy L: They hv lack of narco brains.
2/24/16, 09:59 - Mom: 1:2000 in usa
2/24/16, 09:59 - Cindy L: Sure that's only a statistic
2/24/16, 09:59 - Cindy L: And how any of those offer up for research
2/24/16, 10:00 - Cindy L: Whatever in any case it's still the most compelling reason I can think of
2/24/16, 10:00 - Mom: offer for research is another issue, but ur asking for a uni place
2/24/16, 10:01 - Cindy L: I srsly cannot come up with a good solid tranfer statement then.
2/24/16, 10:01 - Cindy L: I mean with a weak PS and no uni grades I might as well not even waste my time.
2/24/16, 10:01 - Mom: why not? just say u want to pick another career
2/24/16, 10:02 - Cindy L: Because transfer rate is 2% miss
2/24/16, 10:02 - Mom: yea, that's why i wudn't consider stanford if i were u
2/24/16, 10:02 - Cindy L: Even ppl with spectacular profile and are ethnic minority and have tragic background can't get in.
2/24/16, 10:03 - Cindy L: But the research centre is there.
2/24/16, 10:03 - Mom: nvm, just try ur way to see what comes up
2/24/16, 10:03 - Mom: so, do u still try cornell and others?
2/24/16, 10:03 - Cindy L: Only other option I can think of is Cornell
2/24/16, 10:03 - Mom: cornell has a high acceptance rate
2/24/16, 10:04 - Cindy L: But Cornell u should have at last uni grades
2/24/16, 10:04 - Cindy L: At least
2/24/16, 10:04 - Cindy L: Cuz good grades =gto
2/24/16, 10:04 - Mom: ok, what abt ucl?
2/24/16, 10:05 - Cindy L: Yea so American transfer looks bleak right now
2/24/16, 10:05 - Cindy L: So we come back to ucl
2/24/16, 10:06 - Cindy L: I looked at all my options
2/24/16, 10:06 - Cindy L: Decided that realistically if I were to change my current bsc I should only switch to neurosci
2/24/16, 10:07 - Cindy L: I looked on extra yesterday
2/24/16, 10:07 - Cindy L: And neuroscience was still there
2/24/16, 10:07 - Cindy L: Strangely the page says they only accept students from outside of eu
2/24/16, 10:07 - Cindy L: Yay?
2/24/16, 10:08 - Mom: where? can't find it?
2/24/16, 10:08 - Cindy L: Google ucas extra search
2/24/16, 10:13 - Mom: i just read the page but no info abt only applicable for outside eu student?
2/24/16, 10:15 - Cindy L: There is. Gimme a sec
2/24/16, 10:18 - Cindy L: <Media omitted>
2/24/16, 10:26 - Mom: then u can appy with hksar status
2/24/16, 10:26 - Mom: which is not part of eu
2/24/16, 10:38 - Mom: halo, where ru?
2/24/16, 10:39 - Mom: no juice again?
2/24/16, 11:45 - Cindy L: Sorry
2/24/16, 11:45 - Cindy L: Fell asleep
2/24/16, 11:46 - Cindy L: But no chem, don't even meet initial requirement.
2/24/16, 11:46 - Cindy L: If I'll ask if I could make up for no chem with summer courses.
2/24/16, 11:48 - Mom: how's ur sleep last night?
2/24/16, 11:48 - Mom: took 5htp?
2/24/16, 11:56 - Cindy L: Good
2/24/16, 11:56 - Cindy L: Yep
2/24/16, 11:56 - Mom: so, u just take ur nap voluntarily?
2/24/16, 11:57 - Mom: wake up 4am?
2/24/16, 11:57 - Cindy L: I always take the morning nap cuz I wake up tired and actually haven't finished sleeping.
2/24/16, 11:58 - Mom: this morning still tired after taking 5htp?
2/24/16, 11:58 - Cindy L: Physically tired
2/24/16, 11:59 - Cindy L: Ideally it's suppose to increase serotonin and suppress rem.
2/24/16, 12:00 - Mom: yea, then u can sleep better
2/24/16, 12:00 - Mom: is this the case?
2/24/16, 12:00 - Cindy L: Yea I feel like I actually slept more.
2/24/16, 12:00 - Cindy L: And .....
2/24/16, 12:00 - Mom: u slept later last night?
2/24/16, 12:00 - Cindy L: I think I slept at 2
2/24/16, 12:01 - Cindy L: I dreamt that I fell down a long long way last night.
2/24/16, 12:01 - Cindy L: And I reached the bottom.
2/24/16, 12:01 - Mom: did u hurt?
2/24/16, 12:01 - Cindy L: No
2/24/16, 12:02 - Cindy L: Actually I had a super long dream.
2/24/16, 12:02 - Cindy L: It was also narrative.
2/24/16, 12:02 - Cindy L: So I saw the same people and shit and we were all following the same plot line that's why I knew it was the same dream.
2/24/16, 12:02 - Cindy L: So there was the falling bit
2/24/16, 12:03 - Cindy L: And I got to the bottom.
2/24/16, 12:03 - Cindy L: And I assumed that was the end of the dream
2/24/16, 12:03 - Cindy L: But it didn't finish
2/24/16, 12:03 - Cindy L: I got worried that I had died in real life. Lol
2/24/16, 12:03 - Cindy L: So I pulled myself out
2/24/16, 12:04 - Cindy L: And that was how I woke up at around 4
2/24/16, 12:04 - Mom: when u were awake or inside ur dream?
2/24/16, 12:04 - Cindy L: This is all happening in the dream
2/24/16, 12:05 - Mom: then went bed to sleep again?
2/24/16, 12:05 - Cindy L: Cuz I can think in my dreams and I think I am aware that I am dreaming to some extent
2/24/16, 12:05 - Cindy L: Yea
2/24/16, 12:05 - Cindy L: Great dream though
2/24/16, 12:05 - Cindy L: It was super stable.
2/24/16, 12:06 - Mom: what "super stable" means?
2/24/16, 12:06 - Cindy L: Like usually when I start to regain some of my cognitive skills within my dream
2/24/16, 12:06 - Cindy L: I.e. realise that I am dreaming
2/24/16, 12:07 - Cindy L: The dream space starts breaking down and I wakeup
2/24/16, 12:07 - Cindy L: That is unstable
2/24/16, 12:07 - Cindy L: Stable is the opposite.
2/24/16, 12:08 - Cindy L: Lol
2/24/16, 12:08 - Mom: so when u woke up this morning, ur not refresh right?
2/24/16, 12:09 - Cindy L: I'm less mentally tired
2/24/16, 12:09 - Cindy L: I would say
2/24/16, 12:09 - Cindy L: But feeling physically tired.
2/24/16, 12:09 - Cindy L: As like I had ran ten miles yesterday
2/24/16, 12:10 - Mom: but the fact is u did do any exercise for long time right?
2/24/16, 12:10 - Cindy L: No
2/24/16, 12:11 - Cindy L: I signed up for the gym thofuh
2/24/16, 12:11 - Cindy L: Hurray
2/24/16, 12:11 - Mom: üëçüí™
2/24/16, 12:12 - Cindy L: But yea that summarizes my morning.
2/24/16, 12:12 - Cindy L: Great dream
2/24/16, 12:12 - Cindy L: There was a funeral.
2/24/16, 12:13 - Cindy L: But people wore colourful clothes
2/24/16, 12:13 - Cindy L: And there was also someone who showed up in a wedding dress...lol
2/24/16, 12:13 - Cindy L: I think it was a very rich guy who died
2/24/16, 12:13 - Cindy L: Cuz he had like a billion wives.
2/24/16, 12:14 - Cindy L: And they showed up in night gowns like for a dinner party
2/24/16, 12:15 - Cindy L: But there were many people who came to this dead guys funeral
2/24/16, 12:15 - Mom: another dream?
2/24/16, 12:15 - Cindy L: Lol I think it's like a section of yesterday's?
2/24/16, 12:16 - Mom: hv u ever dream like that b4 ur sleep disorder?
2/24/16, 12:16 - Cindy L: Er... Yeah
2/24/16, 12:16 - Mom: why so many weird dreams?
2/24/16, 12:17 - Cindy L: My dreams were always quite narrative
2/24/16, 12:17 - Cindy L: But with less falling.
2/24/16, 12:17 - Cindy L: So much falling these days
2/24/16, 12:17 - Cindy L: And I'm falling from greater and greater heights
2/24/16, 12:18 - Cindy L: And in the dream, I also feel the 'falling' sensation really vividly.
2/24/16, 12:18 - Mom: so feeling scary?
2/24/16, 12:18 - Cindy L: I feel the acceleration downwards and the wind in my face.
2/24/16, 12:18 - Cindy L: Yea it gets a bit scary
2/24/16, 12:18 - Cindy L: Cuz I dunno if I will feel the pain.
2/24/16, 12:18 - Mom: increased HR?
2/24/16, 12:19 - Cindy L: Not really nowadays.
2/24/16, 12:19 - Cindy L: Just like a dull sense of fear.
2/24/16, 12:19 - Cindy L: Last night was one of the first times I just kept falling till the end...
2/24/16, 12:20 - Mom: can u tell urself to wake up and not falling?
2/24/16, 12:20 - Cindy L: Yea that's called pulling myself out of the dream
2/24/16, 12:20 - Cindy L: That's what I usually do
2/24/16, 12:20 - Cindy L: It's bad
2/24/16, 12:20 - Cindy L: Cuz it interrupts the rem cycle.
2/24/16, 12:21 - Mom: last night, u intentionally not pulling urself out of the dream?
2/24/16, 12:21 - Cindy L: Yea.
2/24/16, 12:21 - Cindy L: And then I didn't wakeup when I reach the bottom
2/24/16, 12:21 - Mom: did u feel better if not pulling out of dream?
2/24/16, 12:21 - Cindy L: Sorry I got worried that I might have died in my sleep , lol
2/24/16, 12:23 - Cindy L: So I pull out after landing.
2/24/16, 12:23 - Mom: that's ur amygdala working
2/24/16, 12:23 - Cindy L: No if it were then it would be instinctively.
2/24/16, 12:24 - Cindy L: But I can control when I exit from a dream voluntarily
2/24/16, 12:25 - Cindy L: Essentially I think I've learnt how to overcome sleep paralysis
2/24/16, 12:25 - Cindy L: Because exiting from a dream feels like that
2/24/16, 12:25 - Mom: this is not good cuz u wud act out ur dream
2/24/16, 12:25 - Cindy L: Yea
2/24/16, 12:26 - Cindy L: There are a few times I woke up and said  something
2/24/16, 12:26 - Mom: do u know ur dreaming at that time?
2/24/16, 12:26 - Cindy L: Yea
2/24/16, 12:27 - Cindy L: Wait no
2/24/16, 12:27 - Mom: is there anybody around u at that time?
2/24/16, 12:27 - Cindy L: Sorry lemme explain better
2/24/16, 12:28 - Cindy L: Sometimes, when I wake up from the dream it's like my body wakes up faster than my brain does
2/24/16, 12:29 - Cindy L: And the dream sort of 'leaks' into reality.
2/24/16, 12:30 - Cindy L: So I wake up, not yet fully conscious, still assuming that I am in the dream space
2/24/16, 12:30 - Mom: my godness!!!
2/24/16, 12:30 - Mom: that's why u always say ur having space disorientation right?
2/24/16, 12:30 - Cindy L: And there would be someone saying stuff to me...
2/24/16, 12:31 - Cindy L: And then because I think there are next to me (cuz in the dream they were) I answer them
2/24/16, 12:31 - Cindy L: But by the time I answer them, I realize that I already woke up
2/24/16, 12:31 - Cindy L: Yea so I get a bit disoriented and need to recalibrate.
2/24/16, 12:32 - Cindy L: But this doesn't happen that often, that's why I can't explain it very precisely.
2/24/16, 12:33 - Mom: i wud advise u to stay on ur bed for some 5 more mins to make sure ur fully wake up mentally and physically so to avoid any disorientation feeling and acting out ur dream?
2/24/16, 12:33 - Mom: just keep this as a practice
2/24/16, 12:34 - Mom: or u can blink ur eyes, move ur head/limbs a bit more time b4 getting out of ur bed
2/24/16, 12:35 - Cindy L: Oh yea I already do that so dw
2/24/16, 12:36 - Cindy L: But depending on the dream, sometimes disorientation last for a long time
2/24/16, 12:36 - Cindy L: And in that case I need to find a real person to talk to.
2/24/16, 12:36 - Cindy L: Lol
2/24/16, 12:37 - Mom: this afternoon, i watched a youtube video abt a girl having narco with cataplexy, but she still can graduated from law school, can't understand how she overcome her difficulties
2/24/16, 12:37 - Cindy L: Er was she on medication?
2/24/16, 12:37 - Mom: i think so
2/24/16, 12:37 - Cindy L: Some ppl say they can't even go to work.....
2/24/16, 12:38 - Cindy L: She must hv found the right meds
2/24/16, 12:38 - Mom: oh, i also read someone said he recovered from his narco with cataplexy
2/24/16, 12:39 - Cindy L: R u looking at some shitty forum?
2/24/16, 12:41 - Mom: it's just a reply to someone's questions abt treatment with narco, he didn't mention how he recovered
2/24/16, 12:41 - Cindy L: Oh
2/24/16, 12:41 - Cindy L: Might be fake
2/24/16, 12:42 - Cindy L: Like the shit ton of fake eczema bullshit online
2/24/16, 12:42 - Mom: not sure
2/24/16, 12:43 - Mom: but there's another guy who said he also had "remission" of his narco, but then after a long time his narco seemed come back again?
2/24/16, 12:43 - Cindy L: Dude internet is an unregulated market for information
2/24/16, 12:43 - Cindy L: Which makes it like a taobao
2/24/16, 12:44 - Cindy L: Those strange cases
2/24/16, 12:44 - Cindy L: Maybe KLS
2/24/16, 12:44 - Mom: kls is totally different from narco
2/24/16, 12:45 - Cindy L: No symptoms r quite similar to narco.
2/24/16, 12:45 - Cindy L: Except without cataplexy
2/24/16, 12:46 - Mom: but for kls, sleep duration is much more longer than that for narco
2/24/16, 12:46 - Cindy L: Is it?
2/24/16, 12:46 - Cindy L: I thought they also experience eds
2/24/16, 12:46 - Cindy L: Or is it just hypersomnia?
2/24/16, 12:47 - Mom: eds duration totally different
2/24/16, 12:47 - Cindy L: Oh I see
2/24/16, 12:47 - Mom: kls much longer, may sleep for days or weeks but narco sleep just short time
2/24/16, 12:47 - Cindy L: Oh wow
2/24/16, 12:47 - Cindy L: Nvn
2/24/16, 12:47 - Cindy L: Nvm
2/24/16, 12:48 - Mom: i read news recently abt a place when so many ppl had sudden sleep attacks for days/weeks, i thought they had kls
2/24/16, 12:49 - Cindy L: Hmmmm
2/24/16, 12:50 - Cindy L: Weird
2/24/16, 12:50 - Mom: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnZL3RK_waY
2/24/16, 12:51 - Mom: just below this video, there's a guy name "sinano" who said he recovered from narco
2/24/16, 13:00 - Cindy L: Mopps
2/24/16, 13:00 - Cindy L: Youtube commenters are trolls
2/24/16, 13:01 - Cindy L: So I hv brain damagr. Like I said.
2/24/16, 13:01 - Cindy L: I also read online that this guy basically did what I'm doing went to study the shit himself and he says the key is neurogenesis
2/24/16, 13:02 - Mom: errr...
2/24/16, 13:02 - Cindy L: There is this researcher at kcl who's research is neurogenesis
2/24/16, 13:03 - Cindy L: Cuz apparently u can grow new neurons in the hippocampus
2/24/16, 13:03 - Mom: u mean the guy saying his narco totally recovered?
2/24/16, 13:03 - Mom: yea i know
2/24/16, 13:03 - Cindy L: I forgot what disease he had but yea he said he recovered
2/24/16, 13:04 - Mom: sigh....
2/24/16, 13:05 - Cindy L: I mean there is solution out there but it costs billions of dollars.
2/24/16, 13:05 - Cindy L: Basically they just need to research orexin agonists
2/24/16, 13:06 - Mom: well, $ is always a big prob in the R&D area
2/24/16, 13:06 - Cindy L: They already found orexin inhibitors
2/24/16, 13:06 - Cindy L: Suvorexant
2/24/16, 13:07 - Mom: why inhibit?
2/24/16, 13:07 - Cindy L: Sleep medications.
2/24/16, 13:07 - Cindy L: Orexin makes u stay awake
2/24/16, 13:08 - Mom: kkk
2/24/16, 13:09 - Cindy L: So after all, I think should I just stay here and be a day trader.
2/24/16, 13:10 - Mom: what's ur plan now?
2/24/16, 13:10 - Cindy L: And self fund my research project
2/24/16, 13:10 - Mom: hahahahahahahahahaha
2/24/16, 13:11 - Cindy L: Why is lse so damn verbose
2/24/16, 13:12 - Cindy L: Why can't they just speak normally
2/24/16, 13:12 - Mom: day trader = gambler
2/24/16, 13:12 - Mom: how often can u see a gambler win all his lifetime
2/24/16, 13:13 - Cindy L: U know wealth actually exists as a flow
2/24/16, 13:13 - Mom: it's only ppl in govt dept right?
2/24/16, 13:13 - Cindy L: No everywwhere
2/24/16, 13:13 - Cindy L: Even the math is wordy as hell
2/24/16, 13:13 - Cindy L: That's why they suck
2/24/16, 13:13 - Mom: even those finance guy do
2/24/16, 13:13 - Cindy L: Dunno finance guys don't do shit.
2/24/16, 13:13 - Mom: arrrr
2/24/16, 13:14 - Cindy L: Cuz the stuff they make u reading is written in Shakespearian
2/24/16, 13:14 - Cindy L: So everyone thinks they hv to write in Shakespearian as well
2/24/16, 13:15 - Mom: is that the case in uk uni?
2/24/16, 13:15 - Cindy L: I dunno maybe
2/24/16, 13:15 - Mom: maybe brits r like that?
2/24/16, 13:15 - Cindy L: I'd say probably
2/24/16, 13:15 - Cindy L: That's why they suck at everything tbh
2/24/16, 13:16 - Mom: i rmb i read a book abt uk culture
2/24/16, 13:17 - Mom: in that a guy with 1/2 of his body inside the sea, he wanted to ask for help, and then he can't speak proper british language, so nobody saved him
2/24/16, 13:17 - Cindy L: hahaha that would be true
2/24/16, 13:18 - Cindy L: but i think more likely cuz everyone's in their own little word that nobody helps him
2/24/16, 13:18 - Cindy L: world
2/24/16, 13:18 - Cindy L: even math is verbose can u believe it.
2/24/16, 13:19 - Cindy L: its like they never though that it might be easier to show stuff through numbers, like the rest of the world
2/24/16, 13:19 - Mom: just words, no computations?
2/24/16, 13:20 - Cindy L: ok so for example; if u look online at the us resources. they give u the theorem and then the proof
2/24/16, 13:20 - Cindy L: its numbered and all nicely laid out
2/24/16, 13:20 - Cindy L: here i open my maths lecture notes and its just paragraphs and paragraphs of text.
2/24/16, 13:21 - Cindy L: and then i remember doing combinations in class the other day
2/24/16, 13:21 - Mom: so u've decided not to ask for transfer to maths dept right?
2/24/16, 13:21 - Cindy L: i don't know, now i have reservations...
2/24/16, 13:22 - Cindy L: so we were doing combinations, the boy next to me basically wrote this mini paragraph for essentially a short equation.
2/24/16, 13:23 - Cindy L: u know what the best dept in lse should be
2/24/16, 13:23 - Cindy L: i have no doubt it would be law.
2/24/16, 13:23 - Cindy L: verboseland
2/24/16, 13:23 - Mom: why?
2/24/16, 13:23 - Cindy L: law is written in the most convoluted way possible
2/24/16, 13:24 - Cindy L: so verbose land for a verbose subject
2/24/16, 13:24 - Mom: üòÇ
2/24/16, 13:24 - Cindy L: i am so glad to have a chinese lady for macro right now
2/24/16, 13:25 - Mom: so the best way to transfer out now is to take some chem sub and apply for a natural science deg la
2/24/16, 13:25 - Cindy L: yea
2/24/16, 13:25 - Cindy L: but still, my lse degree
2/24/16, 13:25 - Cindy L: is worth more than a science deg if u think about it
2/24/16, 13:26 - Mom: i think brits r like that u can see from their cabinet debate, full of weird languages
2/24/16, 13:26 - Cindy L: It's not, it's just that they can't express thoughts clearly in a succinct manner.
2/24/16, 13:26 - Mom: actually, u lse deg is a valuable deg if u go work in finance area
2/24/16, 13:27 - Cindy L: yeah ofc
2/24/16, 13:27 - Cindy L: but with narco; i can only do:
2/24/16, 13:28 - Cindy L: 1. catering
2/24/16, 13:28 - Mom: ok la, work on parallel line: lse and chem courses
2/24/16, 13:28 - Cindy L: 2. creatives.
2/24/16, 13:28 - Mom: why catering?
2/24/16, 13:28 - Cindy L: cuz its a lot of work
2/24/16, 13:29 - Cindy L: def not a desk job
2/24/16, 13:29 - Mom: lots of work makes u not sleepy?
2/24/16, 13:29 - Cindy L: yeah lots of physical labour makes me not sleepy
2/24/16, 13:29 - Cindy L: or less likely to sleep
2/24/16, 13:29 - Mom: but creatives job need to stay on desk?
2/24/16, 13:29 - Cindy L: its that sad.
2/24/16, 13:30 - Cindy L: no creatives is physical work
2/24/16, 13:30 - Cindy L: like no dealing with verbosity
2/24/16, 13:30 - Cindy L: and words
2/24/16, 13:31 - Mom: this is the strange part of ur disorder: u won't fall asleep when ur engaging in activities, only when u stay still, u'll fall asleep?
2/24/16, 13:31 - Cindy L: yes
2/24/16, 13:31 - Cindy L: i think i just have more emotive intelligence than actual intelligence
2/24/16, 13:31 - Cindy L: lol
2/24/16, 13:32 - Cindy L: i think that was why i was good at english analysis
2/24/16, 13:32 - Cindy L: but i can't organize my thoughts for life
2/24/16, 13:34 - Mom: not can't organize, just can't express own thoughts verbally and immediately right?
2/24/16, 13:34 - Cindy L: yeah
2/24/16, 13:34 - Cindy L: like the cognitive part of my brain just seems to work slower
2/24/16, 13:35 - Cindy L: i need time to think about logical shit like philosophy
2/24/16, 13:35 - Cindy L: its like i have a learning problem or something.
2/24/16, 13:35 - Mom: ai,.. not slower just ur organization of thoughts is a bit untidy and u need more time to extract them and put into proper place
2/24/16, 13:36 - Cindy L: yea
2/24/16, 13:36 - Mom: learning prob?
2/24/16, 13:36 - Cindy L: like sometimes i listen to somebody
2/24/16, 13:36 - Mom: u don't hv learning prob, ur just not that type of person
2/24/16, 13:37 - Cindy L: and i know english, but i have no idea what the hell they just said
2/24/16, 13:37 - Cindy L: it's like i zoned out.
2/24/16, 13:37 - Mom: so how can u fully use ur intelligence in a weak point
2/24/16, 13:37 - Mom: i know what u mean
2/24/16, 13:38 - Cindy L: i mean i'm fine with econ
2/24/16, 13:38 - Cindy L: its quite interesting
2/24/16, 13:38 - Cindy L: wish it had more math, but u know wordiness
2/24/16, 13:39 - Mom: basically, social sci subj all like that
2/24/16, 13:39 - Mom: if u want more figure, go to accountancy
2/24/16, 13:39 - Cindy L: no way accountancy is excel
2/24/16, 13:39 - Mom: lots of maths computation
2/24/16, 13:40 - Mom: u say u want figures right?
2/24/16, 13:40 - Cindy L: that guy from pwc said that if u know how to use formulas in excel, u are in the 1%
2/24/16, 13:40 - Mom: chi seen
2/24/16, 13:40 - Cindy L: and then if u know how to make pivot tables u are in the 0.1%
2/24/16, 13:41 - Mom: he's exaggerated
2/24/16, 13:41 - Cindy L: i really don't think so...
2/24/16, 13:41 - Cindy L: how many people know how to write macros?
2/24/16, 13:41 - Mom: every business student knows how to use excel and plot tables
2/24/16, 13:42 - Cindy L: not pivot tables
2/24/16, 13:42 - Mom: for excel?
2/24/16, 13:42 - Cindy L: yeah
2/24/16, 13:42 - Mom: not that difficult
2/24/16, 13:42 - Cindy L: pivot tables are special cuz u can manipulate the data in them.
2/24/16, 13:42 - Cindy L: as in u can manipulate the graph as well
2/24/16, 13:43 - Cindy L: basically a better interface
2/24/16, 13:43 - Cindy L: but whatever.
2/24/16, 13:44 - Mom: i'm so curious that how wud u like history as u said u don't like verbose?
2/24/16, 13:44 - Cindy L: history can be succinct
2/24/16, 13:44 - Cindy L: it just a matter of how u present information
2/24/16, 13:45 - Mom: but history books r full of words
2/24/16, 13:46 - Cindy L: it should always be the writer's reponsibility to write clearly.
2/24/16, 13:46 - Cindy L: that means a lot of shit happened
2/24/16, 13:47 - Cindy L: whereas here, just a lot of bullshit and nothing happened
2/24/16, 13:47 - Mom: ur mean in UK, or lse?
2/24/16, 13:47 - Cindy L: lse
2/24/16, 13:48 - Mom: i can tell u that lse is a uk uni which means lse is not special in uk
2/24/16, 13:48 - Mom: in other words, that's the british style
2/24/16, 13:49 - Cindy L: maybe perhaps
2/24/16, 13:49 - Cindy L: but we get fed a lot of lse papers
2/24/16, 13:50 - Cindy L: that's why the americans don't like us :(
2/24/16, 13:50 - Cindy L: cuz they live in clear expressions land
2/24/16, 13:50 - Cindy L: :(
2/24/16, 13:50 - Mom: go to us la
2/24/16, 13:51 - Mom: u decided not to apply for transfer to us now?
2/24/16, 13:55 - Cindy L: er i'll continue working on the essay
2/24/16, 13:51 - Mom: i mean b4 mar 1
2/24/16, 13:55 - Cindy L: no mar15 is next deadline
2/24/16, 13:55 - Cindy L: mar 1 is just columbia
2/24/16, 13:56 - Mom: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2934983/I-don-t-want-spend-rest-life-bed-cruel-condition-sees-people-sleep-EIGHTEEN-HOURS-time-drug-glimmer-hope-sufferers.html
2/24/16, 13:56 - Mom: see this news, i think this guy is suffering from KLS
2/24/16, 13:57 - Mom: u'll see the difference between kls and narco
2/24/16, 14:00 - Cindy L: I see
2/24/16, 14:01 - Cindy L: I swear too much outdoor activity ain't good for u
2/24/16, 14:07 - Mom: deadline mar 15, which uni?
2/24/16, 14:07 - Mom: cornell?
2/24/16, 14:18 - Cindy L: Cornell
2/24/16, 14:18 - Cindy L: Stanford
2/24/16, 14:18 - Cindy L: Those
2/24/16, 14:18 - Cindy L: Though I'm just gonna ask before hand
2/24/16, 14:18 - Cindy L: So that I don't waste my time.
2/24/16, 14:19 - Cindy L: Ideally I just needa get some biochem courses.
2/24/16, 14:19 - Cindy L: Seems like grad school is less picky.
2/24/16, 14:20 - Cindy L: And there's always the pre med postbaccs
2/24/16, 14:21 - Mom: to meet the requirement at grad school, u hv to do those biochem courses all by urself if u stay at lse
2/24/16, 14:22 - Cindy L: Yea that's true
2/24/16, 14:22 - Cindy L: I mean ideally I'd transfer
2/24/16, 14:23 - Cindy L: But it won't be reasonable to go to a lesser school right?
2/24/16, 14:23 - Cindy L: That's just dumb.
2/24/16, 14:23 - Mom: that's all depends
2/24/16, 14:24 - Cindy L: I mean I wouldn't transfer to Monash.
2/24/16, 14:24 - Cindy L: Or like Oregon state u
2/24/16, 14:24 - Cindy L: Something like that
2/24/16, 14:25 - Mom: if ur rlly not satified with ur curent and determine not to go into a soc sci career, it wud just be a waste of time and $ to further this deg
2/24/16, 14:25 - Mom: why not try ucsd which is rather good at neuro sci
2/24/16, 14:30 - Cindy L: Oh yea UC don't allow transfer.
2/24/16, 14:31 - Cindy L: I looked that UCSD first
2/24/16, 14:31 - Cindy L: At
2/24/16, 14:31 - Mom: no, they've inter-campus transfer
2/24/16, 14:31 - Cindy L: Yea intercamp
2/24/16, 14:31 - Mom: even community college student can apply transfer to uc college
2/24/16, 14:32 - Cindy L: California is quite restrictive
2/24/16, 14:32 - Mom: why not email them?
2/24/16, 14:33 - Mom: u don't hv a cost, just time
2/24/16, 14:33 - Cindy L: Hai
2/24/16, 14:33 - Cindy L: I don't hv time either this week u see
2/24/16, 14:33 - Cindy L: I hv to deal with group presentation.
2/24/16, 14:33 - Cindy L: The worse thing ever at uni
2/24/16, 14:33 - Mom: will u do the presentation?
2/24/16, 14:35 - Mom: then do ur work la
2/24/16, 14:37 - Cindy L: Yea I'm doing it
2/24/16, 14:37 - Cindy L: I hv to make sense of all this verbosity first
2/24/16, 14:38 - Cindy L: And then deal with technology illiterate ppl
2/24/16, 14:38 - Mom: ok, take ur time
2/24/16, 16:40 - Cindy L: Fucck
2/24/16, 16:40 - Cindy L: I essentially slept the whole day away.
2/24/16, 16:58 - Mom: can u do ur work now?
2/24/16, 16:58 - Mom: can u buy an alarm clock to wake u up constantly?
2/24/16, 17:37 - Mom: hey, wake up la
2/24/16, 17:37 - Mom: ‚è±‚è±‚è±‚è±‚è±‚è±
2/24/16, 17:49 - Mom: i think u shud cut down the serotonin intake to 200mg, 400mg makes u sleepy all the day?
2/24/16, 19:22 - Cindy L: I went away to work
2/24/16, 19:22 - Cindy L: The phone is distracting
2/24/16, 19:22 - Cindy L: My room was too stuffy
2/24/16, 19:23 - Mom: Buy a mini alarm clock
2/24/16, 19:24 - Mom: That wud be better in terms calling someone up
2/24/16, 19:25 - Mom: Cuz it's louder
2/24/16, 19:26 - Cindy L: Yea and then my head would hurt like hell
2/24/16, 19:27 - Cindy L: Better to wake naturally.
2/24/16, 19:27 - Cindy L: I mean both ways I can't work anyways, it's a catch 22
2/24/16, 19:28 - Mom: Err
2/24/16, 19:31 - Cindy L: So I stopped wearing socks
2/24/16, 19:32 - Cindy L: Cuz I can't be bothered to wash them.
2/24/16, 19:33 - Mom: No ur feet wud be too cold that makes u a want to sleep
2/24/16, 19:34 - Mom: Buy more and wash them in one go
2/24/16, 19:50 - Cindy L: Did u know being unsociable means u hv more activity on the right side of your brain
2/24/16, 23:46 - Mom: So?
2/25/16, 02:11 - Cindy L: Explains why creative people are a bit all over the place.
2/25/16, 02:28 - Mom: 2am still working?
2/25/16, 02:29 - Mom: how can u get enough rest?
2/25/16, 07:41 - Cindy L: I slept till 1630 yesterday
2/25/16, 07:41 - Mom: from what time?
2/25/16, 07:43 - Cindy L: I pretty much napped the whole afternoon in my room
2/25/16, 07:44 - Mom: that's why i told u to buy an alarm clock so that u can set alarm for every 30mins and not to overslept
2/25/16, 07:44 - Mom: what abt the evening? can u work?
2/25/16, 07:44 - Cindy L: That would make me more anxiety attacks
2/25/16, 07:44 - Cindy L: Alarms r not good for the brain or body
2/25/16, 07:45 - Mom: napping for whole afternoon def is not sleep attack right?
2/25/16, 07:45 - Cindy L: No
2/25/16, 07:46 - Mom: did u take 200 mg 5htp last night?
2/25/16, 07:46 - Cindy L: No
2/25/16, 07:46 - Cindy L: Cuz I need to go to econ
2/25/16, 07:46 - Mom: this morning?
2/25/16, 07:46 - Mom: how's ur sleep last night?
2/25/16, 07:48 - Cindy L: Good
2/25/16, 07:48 - Mom: k
2/25/16, 07:48 - Cindy L: I feel like the serotonin helped balance stuff out
2/25/16, 07:49 - Cindy L: I feel normal now.
2/25/16, 07:49 - Mom: ok
2/25/16, 07:49 - Cindy L: Few days ago was like extreme depressed.
2/25/16, 07:49 - Mom: but it seems u've to work out the quantity
2/25/16, 07:49 - Mom: maybe take it every other day
2/25/16, 07:49 - Cindy L: Yea
2/25/16, 07:49 - Cindy L: 2 caps seems to work
2/25/16, 07:50 - Cindy L: 1 cap not so much
2/25/16, 07:50 - Cindy L: But 2 caps every day is too much
2/25/16, 07:50 - Mom: but the effect might be extreme tired the day after
2/25/16, 07:50 - Cindy L: Maybe it depends on how down u are.
2/25/16, 07:50 - Mom: exactly what i meant
2/25/16, 07:50 - Cindy L: Like the first day I was very down
2/25/16, 07:51 - Cindy L: So two caps worked very well
2/25/16, 07:51 - Mom: try out the amount + do some exercise
2/25/16, 07:55 - Cindy L: Kk
2/25/16, 07:55 - Mom: üëç
2/25/16, 08:15 - Cindy L: Dunno why I fell into depression so quickly after Berlin though
2/25/16, 08:16 - Mom: it's ur brain chemical imbalance, u can't tell
2/25/16, 08:16 - Mom: ur homeostasis has to be regulated cautiously
2/25/16, 08:27 - Cindy L: Did I mention I had a panic/ anxiety attack yesterday?
2/25/16, 08:27 - Cindy L: In the evening
2/25/16, 08:27 - Cindy L: no at night
2/25/16, 08:27 - Mom: what happen?
2/25/16, 08:28 - Cindy L: Sudden muscle tension
2/25/16, 08:28 - Cindy L: Increase hr
2/25/16, 08:28 - Cindy L: Cause hyperventilation
2/25/16, 08:28 - Cindy L: And then don't really remember cuz I started hallucinating
2/25/16, 08:29 - Cindy L: Remember that list I sent u
2/25/16, 08:29 - Cindy L: This is number 4
2/25/16, 08:29 - Cindy L: Loss of total control over body basically.
2/25/16, 08:30 - Cindy L: Which is weird because I saw on YouTube people can still move during anxiety attack.
2/25/16, 08:30 - Cindy L: That's why I initially described them as seizures.
2/25/16, 08:31 - Cindy L: But then it's not like a general one seizure
2/25/16, 08:32 - Mom: what's ur position at the moment? and did u shake urself?
2/25/16, 08:32 - Mom: and how long the whole incident lasted?
2/25/16, 08:35 - Cindy L: Sitting in front of the laptop
2/25/16, 08:35 - Mom: all i can guess is the effect of serotonin on ur body?
2/25/16, 08:35 - Cindy L: For like 20-30 mins
2/25/16, 08:35 - Cindy L: Err this happens from time to time
2/25/16, 08:35 - Cindy L: And I'm always sitting in front of my laptop
2/25/16, 08:35 - Mom: even in hk?
2/25/16, 08:36 - Cindy L: It also happened once in the cinema.
2/25/16, 08:36 - Cindy L: Yea
2/25/16, 08:36 - Cindy L: Even in hk
2/25/16, 08:36 - Cindy L: I had it ever since the beginning
2/25/16, 08:36 - Cindy L: Since Nov 2014
2/25/16, 08:36 - Mom: also had hallucinations in hk?
2/25/16, 08:37 - Cindy L: Not sure
2/25/16, 08:37 - Cindy L: No not like the ones now.
2/25/16, 08:38 - Mom: don't think u had hallucinations in hk cuz i witnessed ur situation and saw nothing except trembling and muscles atonia
2/25/16, 08:38 - Mom: yea, u had so many hallucinations in uk
2/25/16, 08:40 - Mom: what do u mean by " when u saw Youtube ppl still moving"?
2/25/16, 08:40 - Cindy L: U can't see someone having a hallucination.
2/25/16, 08:40 - Cindy L: They hallucinate in their mind
2/25/16, 08:41 - Cindy L: Not everyone acts it out
2/25/16, 08:41 - Mom: but u never mentioned that u saw so many stuff in hk?
2/25/16, 08:42 - Mom: i saw once u acted out ur hallucination which was the time when u had taken ritalin
2/25/16, 08:46 - Cindy L: Yea now its like mainly hearing people talking.
2/25/16, 08:46 - Cindy L: And think that someone is behind me or nearby
2/25/16, 08:46 - Cindy L: In non threatening ways
2/25/16, 08:47 - Cindy L: They are not cevs u get from hallucinogens
2/25/16, 08:47 - Mom: so basically u just heard ppl talking around, not seeing ppl right?
2/25/16, 08:47 - Cindy L: Yea
2/25/16, 08:48 - Mom: and u feel someone nearby?
2/25/16, 08:48 - Cindy L: Even though I know that there was definitely nobody there.
2/25/16, 08:48 - Cindy L: Sometimes they talk to me
2/25/16, 08:48 - Mom: what "cevs" r?
2/25/16, 08:48 - Cindy L: But I can't respond
2/25/16, 08:48 - Cindy L: Closed eye visuals
2/25/16, 08:48 - Mom: how did they talk to u?
2/25/16, 08:49 - Mom: asking Q?
2/25/16, 08:49 - Cindy L: No
2/25/16, 08:49 - Mom: or tell u to do something?
2/25/16, 08:49 - Cindy L: Like yesterday i thought there was a girl behind me who kept offering me water from her bottle
2/25/16, 08:50 - Mom: but u said u didn't see? how did u know she's offering u water?
2/25/16, 08:52 - Cindy L: I saw the water bottle
2/25/16, 08:52 - Cindy L: It was pink
2/25/16, 08:53 - Mom: these stuff were in ur muscles tension period?
2/25/16, 16:09 - Cindy L: Yes
2/25/16, 16:30 - Mom: finish class?
2/26/16, 10:45 - Mom: hello
2/26/16, 10:51 - Cindy L: Hi
2/26/16, 10:52 - Mom: slept well last night?
2/26/16, 10:53 - Cindy L: U know what the problem with Europeans are.
2/26/16, 10:53 - Cindy L: ?
2/26/16, 10:53 - Cindy L: They always say that you can do whatever you like
2/26/16, 10:54 - Cindy L: Which is certainly not true
2/26/16, 10:54 - Mom: ofc la
2/26/16, 10:55 - Cindy L: But when u straight up ask them what do you want From me
2/26/16, 10:55 - Cindy L: They don't fucking answer u
2/26/16, 10:55 - Mom: what makes u so emotional?
2/26/16, 10:55 - Cindy L: I'm not emotional
2/26/16, 10:55 - Cindy L: Just pissed.
2/26/16, 10:56 - Mom: why?
2/26/16, 10:56 - Cindy L: Cuz I asked that question just now.
2/26/16, 10:56 - Cindy L: And I had to ask three times to get a reply.
2/26/16, 10:56 - Mom: where? in class?
2/26/16, 10:56 - Cindy L: Yep
2/26/16, 10:57 - Mom: sigh....
2/26/16, 10:57 - Mom: take it easy la
2/26/16, 10:57 - Cindy L: Dude I love the math class though
2/26/16, 10:57 - Cindy L: It's yes or no.
2/26/16, 10:58 - Cindy L: And I bet everyone else likes it too cuz attendance is full every lesson
2/26/16, 10:58 - Mom: why didn't she give u an answer right away?
2/26/16, 10:58 - Cindy L: I basically asked how the hell are we supposed to write the essays
2/26/16, 10:59 - Cindy L: The big question which nobody seems to ask
2/26/16, 10:59 - Cindy L: Nobody seems to ask anything here.
2/26/16, 10:59 - Mom: ? nobody ask Q?
2/26/16, 10:59 - Cindy L: Yea
2/26/16, 10:59 - Mom: so quiet in class all the time?
2/26/16, 10:59 - Cindy L: I thought KGV was bad in terms of q
2/26/16, 11:00 - Cindy L: But here is even worse
2/26/16, 11:00 - Cindy L: No questions whatsoever
2/26/16, 11:00 - Cindy L: And at end of lecture sometimes there is a question section.
2/26/16, 11:00 - Mom: again and again, ur not british type person
2/26/16, 11:00 - Cindy L: Basically they force people to ask questions.
2/26/16, 11:01 - Mom: come on, top uni students!!!! unbelievable
2/26/16, 11:01 - Cindy L: I went to poli sci yesterday and the Prof just stood there for abt 2 mins before someone asked a question.
2/26/16, 11:01 - Cindy L: I think people think that questions are for showing off.
2/26/16, 11:02 - Cindy L: Like u must ask a complex question
2/26/16, 11:02 - Mom: is this the same as in other uk uni like kcl, imperial?
2/26/16, 11:02 - Cindy L: Dunno
2/26/16, 11:02 - Cindy L: Just nobody asks for clarification
2/26/16, 11:02 - Cindy L: I have so far never heard of a clarification question being asked.
2/26/16, 11:03 - Cindy L: Even simple things like locations
2/26/16, 11:03 - Cindy L: Nobody ever asks
2/26/16, 11:03 - Cindy L: They just assume u know where everything is or u can find it urself
2/26/16, 11:04 - Mom: maybe they thought they understand the Q very well, then no need to clarify?
2/26/16, 11:04 - Cindy L: R u serious? The lecturers are often so bad at explaining stuff.
2/26/16, 11:05 - Mom: my bad! i never thought of this thing happened in lse
2/26/16, 11:05 - Mom: i presumed that only happened at band 5 uni
2/26/16, 11:06 - Cindy L: Hahaha
2/26/16, 11:06 - Mom: oh no, we might be wrong
2/26/16, 11:06 - Cindy L: That's why they need one to one tutorial at oxbridge
2/26/16, 11:06 - Cindy L: To force them to ask questions.
2/26/16, 11:07 - Mom: i think this situation applies to all elite skl/uni cuz ppl go there just to boost the uni's brand name and not to gain knowledge there
2/26/16, 11:08 - Cindy L: Or everyone needs to pretend they know their shit.
2/26/16, 11:08 - Mom: u can't tell whether similar thing won't happen in oxbridge
2/26/16, 11:08 - Cindy L: That's what my advisor said
2/26/16, 11:08 - Mom: exactly
2/26/16, 11:08 - Cindy L: That's why they get depression and kill themselves
2/26/16, 11:08 - Mom: even if u don't understand, u hv to sort out the prob by urself
2/26/16, 11:09 - Mom: now, i know why ppl easily get into depression
2/26/16, 11:09 - Cindy L: Yea not to mention friendship probs on top of that
2/26/16, 11:10 - Mom: well, that's normal in "elite" skl
2/26/16, 11:10 - Mom: they go there for competition only
2/26/16, 11:10 - Mom: too bad!!!!!
2/26/16, 11:10 - Mom: take it easy la
2/26/16, 11:10 - Cindy L: I like philo, it was clear and just defining shit all the way
2/26/16, 11:11 - Mom: can u simply ask the lecturer/prof by email?
2/26/16, 11:11 - Mom: in fact philo is so funny, definition, definition and definition....
2/26/16, 11:12 - Cindy L: I think people just do that instead
2/26/16, 11:12 - Cindy L: Cuz they don't want other ppl to hear their questions
2/26/16, 11:13 - Mom: to clarify something sometimes means ur stupid or incapable, i thought
2/26/16, 11:13 - Cindy L: Really....
2/26/16, 11:13 - Cindy L: I guess
2/26/16, 11:13 - Mom: that's why ppl won't ask these type of Q openly
2/26/16, 11:14 - Cindy L: Cherr
2/26/16, 11:14 - Cindy L: I hv shit tons of dumb questions
2/26/16, 11:14 - Mom: better ask privately la
2/26/16, 11:15 - Cindy L: ....
2/26/16, 11:15 - Cindy L: U know just not being able to tell other people that I have a muscle problem is killing me.
2/26/16, 11:16 - Mom: ok, sorry
2/26/16, 11:16 - Mom: ask ur Q in class or in lectures
2/26/16, 11:33 - Cindy L: Also my right eye has problems
2/26/16, 11:33 - Cindy L: It's in pain when I blink
2/26/16, 11:33 - Mom: go see nhs dr
2/26/16, 11:34 - Mom: how long that situation lasts?
2/26/16, 11:36 - Cindy L: Yesterday
2/26/16, 11:36 - Cindy L: It's to do with my brain
2/26/16, 11:36 - Cindy L: I already hv shit tons of eye drops
2/26/16, 11:36 - Mom: take those vegapa again, that helps u fight inflammation
2/26/16, 11:36 - Cindy L: And I haven't even used contacts these days.
2/26/16, 11:41 - Mom: does it help if u took a panadol?
2/26/16, 11:45 - Cindy L: Nor ewally
2/26/16, 11:53 - Mom: i rather thougth that's ur eye muscles prob
2/26/16, 11:56 - Mom: perhaps it's ur corneal abrasion
2/26/16, 11:57 - Mom: is ur eyelashes hurting ur right eye?
2/26/16, 11:57 - Mom: can u take that out or trim it to avoid ur eyelashes hurting the cornea
2/26/16, 13:09 - Cindy L: It's not
2/26/16, 13:10 - Cindy L: It just suddenly started hurting one day
2/26/16, 13:27 - Mom: try take 2 panadols to see if that helps
2/26/16, 13:28 - Mom: rmb the max amout of panadol intake is 8 pcs each day
2/26/16, 22:42 - Mom: Hi
2/26/16, 22:42 - Mom: Ru okay?
2/26/16, 22:43 - Mom: Right eye still painful?

2/27/16, 12:11 - Mom: how often do u use the neck massager?
2/27/16, 12:25 - Cindy L: Occasionally
2/27/16, 12:25 - Cindy L: If I feel like it
2/27/16, 12:25 - Cindy L: It just stings the skin
2/27/16, 12:25 - Cindy L: Doesn't really massage
2/27/16, 12:26 - Mom: is it relaxing using the massager?
2/27/16, 12:27 - Cindy L: No
2/27/16, 12:27 - Mom: so no benefits of using it?
2/27/16, 12:29 - Cindy L: Not really
2/27/16, 12:33 - Mom: so u said u took only a nap during jan16, what actually hv done other than being sick for couple of days?
2/27/16, 12:34 - Mom: also any difference in muscles strength?
2/27/16, 12:34 - Cindy L: Wait a sec, this question is awfully specific
2/27/16, 12:34 - Cindy L: Where r u getting the data from?
2/27/16, 12:34 - Cindy L: No no diff in muscle strength
2/27/16, 12:35 - Mom: u told me

2/27/16, 12:35 - Mom: yea
2/27/16, 12:35 - Cindy L: OK I need to see to rmb, wait a sec
2/27/16, 12:36 - Cindy L: Though I remember I was revising for econ test for like 4/5 days
2/27/16, 12:36 - Cindy L: So it could hv been that
2/27/16, 12:37 - Mom: i mean what special things hv u done other than being sick for a few days?
2/27/16, 12:37 - Cindy L: Revision.
2/27/16, 12:38 - Cindy L: I remember I did have a couple of no.3 type episodes
2/27/16, 12:38 - Mom: and u didn't fall asleep?
2/27/16, 12:38 - Cindy L: In the kitchen, and then my head would hurt and I just go out and take a walk
2/27/16, 12:40 - Mom: u know, ur sleeping pattern is a bit weird
2/27/16, 12:41 - Cindy L: OK Jan I realise I switched to recording everything in my planner
2/27/16, 12:41 - Mom: sometimes u can do revision on econ, do maths for extended periods, but when u read poli sci essay, u fell asleep in fairly short time?
2/27/16, 12:41 - Cindy L: I think it maybe head position.
2/27/16, 12:42 - Cindy L: Like reading u dip ur head down
2/27/16, 12:42 - Cindy L: I found a new way to read the articles anyways.
2/27/16, 12:42 - Mom: why's there a difference? when u do ur maths prob, u still hv to dip ur head down?
2/27/16, 12:43 - Mom: new way? then no doze off?
2/27/16, 12:43 - Cindy L: No
2/27/16, 12:43 - Cindy L: Dozing only happens after too much studying I think
2/27/16, 12:43 - Mom: but when u attend the lectures/class, u head shud be upright?
2/27/16, 12:43 - Cindy L: And if I study in the morning

2/28/16, 04:08 - Cindy L: Yea
2/28/16, 04:08 - Cindy L: And then I woke up in an awk position
2/28/16, 04:09 - Mom: that's why u need alot of nap during daytime
2/28/16, 04:09 - Cindy L: Awkward
2/28/16, 04:09 - Cindy L: No
2/28/16, 04:09 - Cindy L: Not related
2/28/16, 04:09 - Mom: it seems ur circadian rhythm has prob
2/28/16, 04:10 - Cindy L: Whether u tired or not depends on which part of the sleep cycle u wake up during
2/28/16, 04:11 - Cindy L: Yep obviously my circadian rhythm has problems
2/28/16, 04:12 - Cindy L: I think it's relates to changes in body temperature
2/28/16, 04:12 - Mom: not rlly, ur sleep goes into polyphasic sleep
2/28/16, 04:12 - Cindy L: Yea
2/28/16, 04:12 - Cindy L: I sleep polyphasic
2/28/16, 04:13 - Mom: u just mentioned awkward position, how is it?
2/28/16, 04:13 - Cindy L: But not very regular
2/28/16, 04:13 - Cindy L: I just fell asleep with my laptop next to me
2/28/16, 04:14 - Mom: lying on bed? or sitting next to the desk?
2/28/16, 04:14 - Cindy L: Lying on the bed
2/28/16, 04:15 - Mom: u were reading on bed with ur laptop, i think
2/28/16, 04:15 - Mom: u used to do it
2/28/16, 04:15 - Cindy L: Yea
2/28/16, 04:16 - Cindy L: I know, I didn't lose memory
2/28/16, 04:16 - Mom: if so, this is not rlly awkward
2/28/16, 04:16 - Cindy L: I was exaggerating
2/28/16, 04:16 - Mom: omg
2/28/16, 04:17 - Cindy L: So I looked at the natural sciences bsc again
2/28/16, 04:17 - Cindy L: I think it's just a way for u to take dual degrees in ucl
2/28/16, 04:17 - Mom: dual degrees?
2/28/16, 04:17 - Cindy L: Cuz u get to like choose two streams to go into and stuff
2/28/16, 04:18 - Mom: double majors>
2/28/16, 04:18 - Cindy L: Ucl is trying to be more flexible and more American like I can see
2/28/16, 04:18 - Mom: üëç
2/28/16, 04:19 - Cindy L: Like some ppl wanna do say biochem and physics
2/28/16, 04:19 - Cindy L: Or like my thing
2/28/16, 04:19 - Cindy L: Econ and gov
2/28/16, 04:19 - Mom: i know, i reas their website already
2/28/16, 04:20 - Cindy L: OK and then I figured out I need to go basically go I to the biomed sciences stream
2/28/16, 04:20 - Cindy L: And physics or whatever
2/28/16, 04:20 - Cindy L: I just need biomedical sciences
2/28/16, 04:20 - Mom: yea
2/28/16, 04:21 - Mom: time for second round sleep la
2/28/16, 04:21 - Cindy L: Not yet
2/28/16, 04:21 - Cindy L: Usually around 5
2/28/16, 04:22 - Cindy L: I should sleep three rounds in total
2/28/16, 04:22 - Mom: altogether 7hrs?
2/28/16, 04:23 - Cindy L: anyways I should see if I can switch to natural sciences first, cuz I think getting into the streams are pretty lenient with requirements
2/28/16, 04:23 - Mom: ru talking abt this all the way?
2/28/16, 04:23 - Cindy L: Yes altogether 7 hours
2/28/16, 04:24 - Cindy L: What do u mean? Don't get ur question
2/28/16, 04:24 - Mom: i thought u were looking for transfer to natural sci at ucl in the beginning
2/28/16, 04:25 - Mom: am i right?
2/28/16, 04:25 - Cindy L: No I was hesitant cuz I wasn't sure exactly what it is.

3/1/16, 11:49 - Cindy L: Usually completely awake around 10 or 11or even 12
3/1/16, 11:50 - Cindy L: No set time duration
3/1/16, 11:50 - Cindy L: Its not regular, the body just follows the rhythm
3/1/16, 11:50 - Cindy L: But this set up is for max energy and least tiredness
3/1/16, 11:51 - Cindy L: On days where i have to wake up at 9 for econ, i sleep in the next class.
3/1/16, 11:51 - Cindy L: Which is lse100 lol
3/1/16, 11:54 - Mom: üòü
3/1/16, 11:55 - Cindy L: I sleep worst in 2nd block
3/1/16, 11:55 - Cindy L: And then i also sleep in the afternoon depending on conditions
3/1/16, 11:56 - Cindy L: I.e. Activity level, stuffiness of room, coldness
3/1/16, 11:56 - Cindy L: So i usually go out to hv a coffee around 5
3/1/16, 11:56 - Mom: no coffee in the morning?
3/1/16, 11:56 - Cindy L: No doesnt help
3/1/16, 11:56 - Cindy L: Probably only with shitting
3/1/16, 11:57 - Cindy L: But i only hv oatmeal in thw morning now cuz i bought a pack and its huge
3/1/16, 11:57 - Mom: üòÇ
3/1/16, 12:00 - Cindy L: Coffee probably helps later in the evening
3/1/16, 12:00 - Cindy L: Im not sure
3/1/16, 12:00 - Cindy L: I still slept after dinner yesterday so doesnt say much.
3/1/16, 12:00 - Cindy L: And i made econ notes at 4
3/1/16, 12:00 - Cindy L: Lol
3/1/16, 12:00 - Cindy L: I always sleep after meals
3/1/16, 12:01 - Cindy L: I think something abt digesting meals releases neurotransmitters which trigger sleep/ rem action
3/1/16, 12:02 - Mom: those r sleep or nap right?
3/1/16, 12:02 - Cindy L: Nap and sleep r pretty much the same thing....
3/1/16, 12:02 - Mom: what abt if u don't eat?
3/1/16, 12:02 - Mom: no, nap for shorter time
3/1/16, 12:02 - Cindy L: Then higher chance of staying awake
3/1/16, 12:03 - Mom: how long ur sleep after each meal?
3/1/16, 12:03 - Mom: 10/15/30 mins?
3/1/16, 12:04 - Cindy L: Erm its like naps so around 15 i would say
3/1/16, 12:04 - Cindy L: Its rem
3/1/16, 12:04 - Cindy L: Sometimes i get tired and fall asleep
3/1/16, 12:04 - Cindy L: Sometimes i dont notice and slip into rem
3/1/16, 12:05 - Cindy L: So i get rem related hallucinations and shit
3/1/16, 12:05 - Cindy L: And before i collapsed everytime cuz rem atonia is also a way to make up for rem deficiency
3/1/16, 12:06 - Mom: u don't hv rem deficiency, i think
3/1/16, 12:07 - Cindy L: Theres long term and short term mechanisms regulating the amount of rem one shoulsms hv apparently
3/1/16, 12:07 - Cindy L: Should
3/1/16, 12:08 - Cindy L: In regards to the long term one, i think that has been repaid
3/1/16, 12:08 - Cindy L: The short term is a bit difficult to fix
3/1/16, 12:09 - Cindy L: Because essentially rem is related to the nrem i get
3/1/16, 12:10 - Cindy L: Read this
3/1/16, 12:11 - Cindy L: <Media omitted>
3/1/16, 12:51 - Mom: i hv read similar articles abt nrem and rem sleep from those neurology website
3/1/16, 12:52 - Mom: did u get the ginseng extract?
3/1/16, 12:52 - Cindy L: Ye
3/1/16, 12:52 - Cindy L: I bought a book abt rem
3/1/16, 12:53 - Mom: those r from book?
3/1/16, 12:54 - Cindy L: Yea
3/1/16, 12:54 - Cindy L: Its a collection of articles
3/1/16, 12:54 - Mom: i usually type out the key words and google online
3/1/16, 12:54 - Cindy L: Yea i know
3/1/16, 12:55 - Mom: how many pp can u read at a time for this book?
3/1/16, 12:55 - Cindy L: I aim for one article each time
3/1/16, 12:55 - Cindy L: Its not that difficult to read actually
3/1/16, 12:57 - Mom: simply facts but u can't rlly understand the mechanism behind cuz those r research findings only
3/1/16, 12:58 - Mom: even neurologists can't fully explain their causal relationship
3/1/16, 12:59 - Cindy L: yes
3/1/16, 12:59 - Cindy L: correcto
3/1/16, 13:00 - Cindy L: but this book is all of the solid theory, like been peer reviewed and stuff
3/1/16, 13:00 - Mom: u know, me 7 emos r eating potatoes for dinner, hoping to lose weight
3/1/16, 13:00 - Cindy L: so we assume it is the truth for now
3/1/16, 13:00 - Cindy L: ....
3/1/16, 13:00 - Cindy L: u need to only eat potatoes.
3/1/16, 13:00 - Cindy L: i wouldn't eat potatoes if i were u
3/1/16, 13:00 - Mom: for now ....only
3/1/16, 13:01 - Cindy L: u need to exercise to get rid of the carbs too
3/1/16, 13:01 - Mom: yea, we eat potatoes for dinner
3/1/16, 13:01 - Mom: and i eat only bkf and dinner
3/1/16, 13:01 - Cindy L: so
3/1/16, 13:01 - Cindy L: u still eat
3/1/16, 13:02 - Mom: i feel my stomach is not that bumpy
3/1/16, 13:02 - Cindy L: and obviously u have a metabolic problem
3/1/16, 13:02 - Cindy L: i just means ur stomach is not holding food
3/1/16, 13:12 - Cindy L: The wifi here is so shit
3/1/16, 13:14 - Mom: ofc my stomach is not for holding food, but it's always full and never get flat even if i didn't eat
3/1/16, 13:38 - Mom: http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/280579.php
3/1/16, 13:38 - Mom: see potatoes r rlly good
3/1/16, 13:38 - Mom: maybe u shud try as well
3/1/16, 13:45 - Cindy L: U should try l carnite
3/1/16, 13:47 - Mom: that is supplement, but potatoes r natural food
3/1/16, 13:56 - Cindy L: S
3/1/16, 13:56 - Cindy L: So
3/1/16, 13:56 - Cindy L: Everything is organic compounds at rhe end if the day
3/2/16, 11:29 - Cindy L: Im pretty sure unis admit purely based on grades now
3/2/16, 11:34 - Mom: so?
3/2/16, 11:34 - Cindy L: So hrades r important
3/2/16, 11:34 - Mom: that girl from kcl to northwest has very good grades?
3/2/16, 11:36 - Mom: this is always true la
3/2/16, 11:37 - Mom: but good grade doesn't guarantee a place as well
3/2/16, 11:37 - Mom: how's day today?
3/2/16, 11:37 - Mom: got ur ginseng already?
3/2/16, 11:41 - Cindy L: No i mean
3/2/16, 11:42 - Cindy L: I asked abt trsf at ucl
3/2/16, 11:42 - Cindy L: And the first thing he asked me was what r ur grades
3/2/16, 11:42 - Cindy L: Lol
3/2/16, 11:42 - Cindy L: So its important to get good ib grades
3/2/16, 11:43 - Mom: don't u hv good ib grades?
3/2/16, 11:43 - Mom: i think 39 is pretty good
3/2/16, 11:43 - Cindy L: Yea i do
3/2/16, 11:43 - Mom: especially for someone who has been sick for a whole yr
3/2/16, 11:43 - Cindy L: But like if u were in a lesser position that would be baaaad
3/2/16, 11:44 - Cindy L: But i dont tell him.i was sick for a year
3/2/16, 11:44 - Cindy L: üòì
3/2/16, 11:44 - Mom: so, what did they comment on ur grades? not good enough?
3/2/16, 11:45 - Cindy L: Nothing, i imagined i had to pass the grades criteria before they would even consider me
3/2/16, 11:46 - Cindy L: So now im waiting to get a reply on how i should submit my app
3/2/16, 11:46 - Cindy L: Though i would imagine us trf to be similar
3/2/16, 11:49 - Mom: so u have to list out all ur ib grades to them?
3/2/16, 11:50 - Mom: hv u done so?
3/2/16, 11:50 - Cindy L: No not all of ur ib grades carry same significance
3/2/16, 11:50 - Cindy L: Its just total score
3/2/16, 11:50 - Cindy L: And highers
3/2/16, 11:51 - Mom: they just require a total ib score?
3/2/16, 11:51 - Mom: not individual subject?
3/2/16, 11:51 - Cindy L: And breakdown for highera
3/2/16, 11:51 - Cindy L: Highers
3/2/16, 11:51 - Mom: ic
3/2/16, 11:51 - Cindy L: So i would say its important to choose impressive highers
3/2/16, 11:51 - Mom: in fact, highers r quite important
3/2/16, 11:51 - Cindy L: I.e. Not hl chinese b
3/2/16, 11:52 - Mom: true that
3/2/16, 11:53 - Cindy L: To be safe, should definitely choose trad subjects for higher
3/2/16, 11:53 - Mom: ofc la
3/2/16, 11:53 - Mom: that's why i told emos to pick triple science
3/2/16, 11:53 - Cindy L: Gcse doesnt count
3/2/16, 11:53 - Cindy L: Hahaha
3/2/16, 11:54 - Mom: i mean if she's going to ib, i wud tell her to pick trad sci subj instead of hl film studies
3/2/16, 11:54 - Cindy L: I would also say hl math is better than hl eng
3/2/16, 11:55 - Mom: true that
3/2/16, 11:55 - Cindy L: Hl eng is rather useless now i look at it
3/2/16, 11:55 - Mom: always choose sci and maths, they're better
3/2/16, 11:55 - Cindy L: I mean if u wanna do law they see history as more presitigious
3/2/16, 11:55 - Mom: that's my point
3/2/16, 11:55 - Cindy L: Yea always do sci and math
3/2/16, 11:55 - Mom: not a must
3/2/16, 11:56 - Mom: if do law, better pick eng and hist
3/2/16, 11:56 - Cindy L: Yea law has no pre reqs, just need to show u know some stuff
3/2/16, 11:56 - Cindy L: I wouldnt take eng
3/2/16, 11:56 - Mom: but ur not choosing law, why pick hist?
3/2/16, 11:56 - Cindy L: Cuz i like the dept
3/2/16, 11:56 - Cindy L: Lol
3/2/16, 11:56 - Mom: in fact, everybody can do law
3/2/16, 11:57 - Cindy L: Bad decision cues
3/2/16, 11:57 - Mom: nvm la
3/2/16, 11:57 - Mom: just a lesson
3/2/16, 11:57 - Cindy L: I actually think hl art is not bad
3/2/16, 11:57 - Cindy L: Like a good combo would be sci math art
3/2/16, 11:57 - Mom: just remind urself to make further decision rationally
3/2/16, 11:57 - Cindy L: Yea
3/2/16, 11:58 - Mom: agree: sci + maths + art = good combo
3/2/16, 11:58 - Cindy L: And then the 2 sci + math is also good
3/2/16, 11:59 - Cindy L: And then do business for sl or something. Hahahaha
3/2/16, 11:59 - Cindy L: Chinese sl a is good if u caan do it
3/2/16, 11:59 - Cindy L: Cuz u get a bilingual dip
3/2/16, 12:00 - Cindy L: Definitely dont takr hl b unless ur going to hk uni
3/2/16, 12:01 - Cindy L: Standard history is good too cuz its easy for ee
3/2/16, 12:01 - Cindy L: Now im just talking to myself
3/2/16, 12:03 - Cindy L: Btw i met a third year med student
3/2/16, 12:04 - Cindy L: Apparently mris here is a three months wait
3/2/16, 12:04 - Cindy L: Everything else should be less than that
3/2/16, 12:06 - Mom: u told him ur going to take mri?
3/2/16, 12:08 - Cindy L: No i asked her how long do u hv to wait to get tests done
3/2/16, 12:08 - Cindy L: Cuz shes doing placement right now so she should know these stuff
3/2/16, 12:08 - Mom: cc
3/2/16, 12:09 - Mom: i think that wud take even longer in hk
3/2/16, 13:15 - Cindy L: Yea

3/2/16, 14:17 - Cindy L: I went to do the laundry

3/2/16, 14:41 - Mom: what?
3/2/16, 14:41 - Cindy L: He says i can only go into physics, earth sci, math and stats and sci and tech streams
3/2/16, 14:42 - Cindy L: Should i bother transferring?
3/2/16, 14:42 - Mom: but u want neurosci right?
3/2/16, 14:42 - Cindy L: Yes biomed
3/2/16, 14:42 - Cindy L: I wanna transfer to uc really..
3/2/16, 14:43 - Cindy L: But they hv credit requirement
3/2/16, 14:43 - Mom: uc or ucl??
3/2/16, 14:43 - Cindy L: Ive looked at all the streams and onlyky medical physics seems close to anything i want to do
3/2/16, 14:44 - Cindy L: University of california
3/2/16, 14:45 - Mom: why don't u just fill in their transfer application and send it to them for consideration?
3/2/16, 14:45 - Mom: actually, u don't hv to bother those credit requirement cuz they must know how to take into ac of ur academic qualifications
3/2/16, 14:46 - Mom: sometimes, i thought ur asking to much like a pre-approval acceptance
3/2/16, 14:47 - Cindy L: Hmm ok
3/2/16, 14:48 - Mom: if uc dont accept this time, u can try 2 or 3 time
3/2/16, 14:48 - Cindy L: Uc application for transfer is nov 30 üòÖ
3/2/16, 14:48 - Mom: no harm

3/2/16, 14:52 - Cindy L: Its not relates
3/2/16, 14:52 - Cindy L: Its like stuff like culture of sci and tech
3/2/16, 14:52 - Cindy L: Or like ethics
3/2/16, 14:53 - Mom: what? ethics?
3/2/16, 14:53 - Mom: not even a sci deg?
3/2/16, 15:00 - Mom: those sci and tech course just like what ur doing at lse
3/2/16, 15:00 - Mom: literally, it shud be a soc sci deg
3/2/16, 15:07 - Cindy L: Yes no point in switching to that crap
3/2/16, 15:08 - Cindy L: Ive looked at all the streams
3/2/16, 15:08 - Cindy L: Only med physics is remotely close
3/2/16, 15:08 - Cindy L: Whatever i managed to huntdown the nw girl
3/2/16, 15:09 - Cindy L: Seems like she applied in exactly the same situation
3/2/16, 15:09 - Mom: did u find her?

3/2/16, 17:01 - Mom: don't look back, just look forward to see what can be made to meet ur new plan
3/2/16, 17:01 - Cindy L: Ik
3/2/16, 17:02 - Mom: or else, u'll just indulge into these emotional turbulence
3/2/16, 17:02 - Cindy L: But when ur head hurts n ur tired....
3/2/16, 17:02 - Mom: take panadol ok
3/2/16, 17:03 - Mom: i think ur tiredness somewhat relates to ur emotional turbulence not necessarily physical
3/2/16, 17:04 - Mom: and i do believe that ur sleep disorder might stem from my decision to move back to tsing yi
3/2/16, 17:04 - Mom: ur too sensitive to everything around
3/2/16, 17:04 - Mom: it's just u don't know
3/2/16, 17:05 - Mom: and ur stress/pressure come along from these trivial things
3/2/16, 17:07 - Cindy L: Ok
3/2/16, 17:09 - Mom: if u do think that u've made a rlly serious incorrect choice at the first place, then u shud try hard to find out way instead of just regretting
3/2/16, 17:10 - Mom: anyway, ur just 19, u still hv time to do something else
3/2/16, 17:11 - Mom: don't think of this a disaster
3/2/16, 17:12 - Mom: u shud calm down and write out ur realistic plan and work towards it
3/2/16, 17:13 - Mom: i think u rlly need someone to talk to
3/2/16, 17:16 - Mom: hello, ru there?
3/2/16, 17:42 - Mom: havn't u bought the pre-cursor of modafinil? haven't tried yet?
3/2/16, 17:46 - Cindy L: Hi
3/2/16, 17:46 - Cindy L: Yes
3/2/16, 17:46 - Cindy L: Adrafinil
3/2/16, 17:46 - Cindy L: I tried it
3/2/16, 17:46 - Cindy L: Didnt really notice anything
3/2/16, 17:47 - Cindy L: And then i tested the purity, wasnt 100% but fine fair enough
3/2/16, 17:47 - Cindy L: But its bad for the liver so i havent really used it.
3/2/16, 17:47 - Mom: how did u test it?
3/2/16, 17:47 - Cindy L: I need modafnil
3/2/16, 17:48 - Cindy L: Solubility in hot water
3/2/16, 17:48 - Mom: what abt if modafinil didn't work at all?
3/2/16, 17:48 - Mom: like ivig?
3/2/16, 17:48 - Cindy L: Then next drug
3/2/16, 17:48 - Cindy L: The most they would give me is ritalin
3/2/16, 17:49 - Cindy L: I already tried that
3/2/16, 17:49 - Cindy L: Modafinil works for most ppl
3/2/16, 17:49 - Mom: so ur going to try all the drug until ur liver get worse
3/2/16, 17:49 - Cindy L: Better than drinking until my liver gets worse lol
3/2/16, 17:50 - Mom: but those ppl also can't stand the side effect of modafinil and then quit
3/2/16, 17:50 - Mom: if this is the case, ur rlly making a life regret choice
3/2/16, 17:51 - Cindy L: Do u realise modafinil is the safest drug in the world as of right now
3/2/16, 17:51 - Cindy L: And i already took the precursor
3/2/16, 17:51 - Cindy L: I think that pretty much settles that modafinil has minimal effects
3/2/16, 17:52 - Cindy L: I think ur confusing the snri with modafinil
3/2/16, 17:53 - Mom: no, i just think that ur thinking too perfect abt modafinil
3/2/16, 17:53 - Mom: and like what i hv mentioned what if it doesn't work at all?
3/2/16, 18:01 - Cindy L: So
3/2/16, 18:01 - Cindy L: <Media omitted>
3/2/16, 22:05 - Cindy L: Mopps
3/2/16, 22:05 - Cindy L: I am so fucking scared
3/2/16, 22:05 - Cindy L: I just heard voices in my head
3/2/16, 22:05 - Cindy L: Like actual words being said
3/2/16, 22:06 - Cindy L: I thought they were coming from my computer
3/2/16, 22:06 - Cindy L: But i dont think so
3/2/16, 22:13 - Cindy L: Yea i just checked
3/2/16, 22:13 - Cindy L: Nope the voices were in my head
3/2/16, 22:13 - Cindy L: Fucccccck
3/2/16, 22:13 - Cindy L: I was having dinner, i finished
3/2/16, 22:13 - Cindy L: Was reading this super long email on my laptop
3/2/16, 22:14 - Cindy L: I was looking a cartoon blog
3/2/16, 22:15 - Cindy L: I heard a male voice with an american accent which sounded like it was coming from a 60s radio
3/2/16, 22:15 - Cindy L: Like something from fallout
3/2/16, 22:16 - Cindy L: At first i assumed it was a little gimmicky thing from the email
3/2/16, 22:16 - Cindy L: And then i heard it a second time when i got to the end of the email
3/2/16, 22:17 - Cindy L: I got confused abt where the voice was coming from
3/2/16, 22:17 - Cindy L: And then i collapsed
3/2/16, 22:18 - Cindy L: I was scared that i might see stuff and start getting anxiety attacks so i just stay there, head down on the table eyes closed
3/2/16, 22:18 - Cindy L: And the voices faded out
3/2/16, 22:19 - Cindy L: And then i took my laptop and ran bck to my room
3/2/16, 22:20 - Cindy L: I dont knoe if it was the food or the monitor which caused it
3/2/16, 22:20 - Cindy L: But both together is just a bad combo
3/2/16, 22:21 - Mom: Where were u b4?
3/2/16, 22:22 - Mom: Kitchen?
3/2/16, 22:22 - Mom: What did he say?
3/2/16, 22:27 - Cindy L: Kitchen
3/2/16, 22:27 - Cindy L: It was like reading the words off the screen the first time
3/2/16, 22:27 - Cindy L: And then second it was gibberish
3/2/16, 22:28 - Cindy L: And i was too scared to pay attention
3/2/16, 22:28 - Mom: so ru okay now?
3/2/16, 22:28 - Cindy L: But it was like talking to me
3/2/16, 22:28 - Cindy L: Yea i stopped looling at the computer screen

3/4/16, 10:48 - Mom: so hoping it's a good day
3/4/16, 10:48 - Cindy L: Yea
3/4/16, 10:48 - Cindy L: Im writing my essays today
3/4/16, 10:49 - Cindy L: So now im trying stanford, nw, cornell, and nyu
3/4/16, 10:49 - Mom: kk
3/4/16, 10:49 - Cindy L: Boston also looks ok
3/4/16, 10:50 - Mom: ok, ttyl
3/4/16, 13:37 - Cindy L: So i found someone with actual sleep paralysis
3/4/16, 13:39 - Cindy L: And im not quite sure if i do get sleep paralysis anymore.
3/4/16, 13:39 - Cindy L: Maybe once or twice
3/4/16, 13:46 - Mom: why?
3/4/16, 13:46 - Mom: not same symptom?
3/4/16, 13:47 - Mom: ur so hardworking to find ppl with same scenario
3/4/16, 13:51 - Cindy L: Hahaha they just happen to be around me
3/4/16, 13:51 - Cindy L: Like in my flat
3/4/16, 13:52 - Cindy L: Back to sp
3/4/16, 13:52 - Cindy L: i rarely get it nowadays, and for me its upon sleeping.
3/4/16, 13:53 - Cindy L: Its more like atonia and i learnt how to move during atonia? If that is possibleüòÖ
3/4/16, 13:55 - Cindy L: The brain adapts really quickly, i might be accidentally rewiring it so my symptoms r changing all the time.
3/4/16, 13:56 - Mom: yea, ur symptoms change alot
3/4/16, 13:57 - Cindy L: Thought the hallucinations seem really similar
3/4/16, 13:57 - Cindy L: Seeing people
3/4/16, 13:57 - Cindy L: Hearing voices
3/4/16, 13:57 - Cindy L: Almost like ability to sense ghosts
3/4/16, 13:57 - Mom: tbh, ur hallucinations look like spiritual thingy
3/4/16, 13:58 - Cindy L: Yes exactly
3/4/16, 13:58 - Cindy L: Thats why people mistaken sleep paralysis as experiencing spirits
3/4/16, 13:58 - Mom: no, sp is different
3/4/16, 13:59 - Mom: u just can't move ur body in that moment
3/4/16, 13:59 - Cindy L: Yea thats sp
3/4/16, 13:59 - Cindy L: But during sp u experience what i believe to be rem related hallucinations
3/4/16, 14:00 - Mom: i mean sp involves inability to move body and seeing spirits is different
3/4/16, 14:01 - Mom: i still hv doubt abt ur hallucinations
3/4/16, 14:01 - Mom: cuz i didn't witness
3/4/16, 14:03 - Cindy L: Its not i just talked to a guy who has chronic sp
3/4/16, 14:05 - Cindy L: These r a specific type of hallucinations cuz the mechanism, i think, is the same
3/4/16, 14:05 - Cindy L: Which is why the content of the hallucinations r all very similar
3/4/16, 14:05 - Cindy L: They're all related to people
3/4/16, 14:06 - Cindy L: Like seeing people, hearing human voices, etc.
3/4/16, 14:07 - Cindy L: I remember leanne said she would sense someone in the same room as her
3/4/16, 14:07 - Cindy L: And i sense and hear people around me
3/4/16, 14:08 - Cindy L: Similarly the guy i talked to said he saw people in the room
3/4/16, 14:08 - Mom: don't u think those experience sounds like spiritual
3/4/16, 14:08 - Cindy L: Yes but those arent spirits because this is science
3/4/16, 14:09 - Cindy L: I think people in the past who said they experience spirits were having the same sort of experience
3/4/16, 14:09 - Mom: there're always things which sci can't explain
3/4/16, 14:09 - Cindy L: Why people?
3/4/16, 14:09 - Cindy L: There, i think its possibly related to memory
3/4/16, 14:10 - Cindy L: Like these hallucinations r projections of your memory
3/4/16, 14:11 - Cindy L: Since the limbic system is very involved in sleep regulation and memory storage
3/4/16, 14:12 - Cindy L: Anyways i think science can explain all of this
3/4/16, 14:12 - Cindy L: Just need someone to read through it all and put it together
3/4/16, 14:16 - Mom: but i just had different personal experience
3/4/16, 14:17 - Cindy L: U dont hv sleep paralysis lah üòë
3/4/16, 14:18 - Mom: never
3/4/16, 14:18 - Mom: i mean spiritual
3/4/16, 14:19 - Cindy L: Dude after having so many of these things, i hv learnt the important of self-doubt
3/4/16, 14:20 - Cindy L: Always doubt whether if the things you know to be true are true or not
3/4/16, 14:20 - Cindy L: Cuz they probably isnt like u thought
3/4/16, 14:20 - Cindy L: How clearly do u remember ur spiritual experience anyways?
3/4/16, 14:21 - Cindy L: And i never said that spirits dont exist, i just meant that some of the experiences can be accounted for by sleep paralysis and rem related hallucinations
3/4/16, 14:23 - Mom: i mean not everything can be explained by rational sci
3/4/16, 14:24 - Mom: not that there isn't sp or hallucination
3/4/16, 14:25 - Cindy L: Nah once science is developed enough it will look like magic
3/4/16, 14:25 - Mom: haha
3/4/16, 14:25 - Cindy L: I hv purged the god out of me
3/4/16, 14:25 - Mom: the condition is "once sci has been developed"
3/4/16, 14:26 - Cindy L: Hence need more stem dunding
3/4/16, 14:26 - Cindy L: Funding
3/4/16, 14:26 - Mom: i don't force u to believe in god thingy but just said there is always something which we don't know
3/4/16, 14:27 - Cindy L: True that
3/4/16, 14:27 - Cindy L: But to be fair, we only started developing this stuff for abt a 100 years or so
3/4/16, 14:28 - Mom: i never saw god but i'm pretty sure i did have seen spirits
3/4/16, 14:28 - Cindy L: ....
3/4/16, 14:29 - Cindy L: Did i tell i that i experienced a hallucination where a girl i knew was whispering into my ear
3/4/16, 14:29 - Mom: who is that girl
3/4/16, 14:29 - Cindy L: Ex kgv
3/4/16, 14:29 - Cindy L: Never talked to her though
3/4/16, 14:29 - Mom: do u know her?
3/4/16, 14:29 - Cindy L: I know of her and who she is
3/4/16, 14:30 - Cindy L: But not friends
3/4/16, 14:30 - Mom: so did she know u?
3/4/16, 14:30 - Cindy L: Dunno
3/4/16, 14:30 - Cindy L: This is why i think it is memory related
3/4/16, 14:30 - Mom: how come u saw her in ur hallucination?
3/4/16, 14:31 - Cindy L: No i sensed her next to me and she grabbed my head and started whispering stuff into my ear
3/4/16, 14:31 - Mom: grabbed ur head? how?
3/4/16, 14:31 - Cindy L: Not sure i just sensed everything
3/4/16, 14:32 - Mom: u sensed her? not seeing her?
3/4/16, 14:32 - Cindy L: By sensed i am referring to tactilory sensation
3/4/16, 14:32 - Cindy L: U know like 5 senses and the 'touch' sensation
3/4/16, 14:32 - Mom: so did u feel painful when she grabbed ur head?
3/4/16, 14:32 - Cindy L: No just the pressure
3/4/16, 14:33 - Cindy L: Theres pressure change wheb someone grabs u
3/4/16, 14:33 - Mom: Q: u just sensed her, not seeing her then how can u tell it's HER?
3/4/16, 14:33 - Cindy L: I dont know
3/4/16, 14:33 - Cindy L: I jist do
3/4/16, 14:33 - Cindy L: I am in an altered state of consciousness so i do not remember exact details
3/4/16, 14:34 - Cindy L: But i just remember she whispering in my ear and i even felt her breath and everything
3/4/16, 14:34 - Cindy L: On my ear
3/4/16, 14:34 - Mom: did u hear what she said?
3/4/16, 14:35 - Cindy L: Yah it was somethibg related to exams
3/4/16, 14:35 - Mom: did that girl get a good ib score?
3/4/16, 14:36 - Cindy L: Like she was saying she didnt want to retake exams cuz if she did she would take inferior ones and everyone would know that she failed
3/4/16, 14:36 - Cindy L: This is what i heard
3/4/16, 14:36 - Cindy L: In reality, she did btech
3/4/16, 14:37 - Cindy L: But personally, i dont think what i heard is related to the person
3/4/16, 14:37 - Cindy L: I sensed
3/4/16, 14:37 - Cindy L: Following the memory hypothesis
3/4/16, 14:39 - Mom: well, i think the msg more represented ur own feeling abt ur exam not hers
3/4/16, 14:39 - Mom: it looks like u did have stress abt ib
3/4/16, 14:39 - Mom: which u didn't realise
3/4/16, 14:40 - Cindy L: Well isnt that obvious
3/4/16, 14:40 - Mom: i found out a way to improve emos facial skin
3/4/16, 14:41 - Mom: that is having mask every night
3/4/16, 14:42 - Cindy L: What sort of mask
3/4/16, 14:42 - Cindy L: Thats great
3/4/16, 14:42 - Cindy L: If u find a way to heal scar tissue
3/4/16, 14:42 - Mom: moisture mask
3/4/16, 14:42 - Cindy L: Even better
3/4/16, 14:43 - Cindy L: Like korean?
3/4/16, 14:43 - Mom: time will do it
3/4/16, 14:43 - Cindy L: No, scar tissue never heals
3/4/16, 14:43 - Cindy L: Its lost the protective layer
3/4/16, 14:44 - Cindy L: At that point u will also develop mental problems
3/4/16, 14:44 - Cindy L: So best thing to do is donate urself to medical research
3/4/16, 14:44 - Cindy L: Lol
3/4/16, 14:44 - Mom: <Media omitted>
3/4/16, 14:45 - Mom: ü§ïü§ï
3/4/16, 14:46 - Cindy L: How long has she been using the masks for?
3/4/16, 14:46 - Mom: for like 20 days already
3/4/16, 14:46 - Mom: and still using
3/4/16, 14:47 - Cindy L: I used the serum for a while
3/4/16, 14:47 - Cindy L: It got better at first
3/4/16, 14:47 - Mom: i think u can try put serum on ur scar tissue
3/4/16, 14:47 - Cindy L: And then either loss effect or made it worse
3/4/16, 14:47 - Cindy L: No serum didnt work at all on my arm
3/4/16, 14:47 - Mom: then u have to change another one
3/4/16, 14:47 - Cindy L: It made it more allergic
3/4/16, 14:47 - Cindy L: Yah
3/4/16, 14:48 - Cindy L: But gotta try
3/4/16, 14:48 - Cindy L: Like drogassss
3/4/16, 14:48 - Mom: so i said u have to change another one which suits u and won't make u allergic
3/4/16, 14:49 - Mom: i was hesitate at first, worrying that she wud get allergic reaction, but so far she didn't
3/4/16, 14:49 - Cindy L: Kk
3/4/16, 14:49 - Mom: and the rashes on her face is getting less
3/4/16, 14:49 - Cindy L: Thats great
3/4/16, 14:50 - Cindy L: Gd news for once
3/4/16, 14:50 - Mom: so if u found allergy abt one serum, u have to change to another
3/4/16, 14:50 - Cindy L: Alright
3/4/16, 14:51 - Mom: perhaps start with the basic one
3/4/16, 14:51 - Cindy L: I tried the muji one
3/4/16, 14:51 - Mom: sometimes those basics are pretty good
3/4/16, 14:51 - Cindy L: Basically didnt work at all
3/4/16, 14:51 - Cindy L: And then the body shop one which has plant stem cells
3/4/16, 14:51 - Cindy L: Worked on face
3/4/16, 14:51 - Cindy L: Not on arm
3/4/16, 14:51 - Mom: jap thing doesn't necessary suit ur skin type
3/4/16, 14:52 - Cindy L: The toner is very good though
3/4/16, 14:53 - Mom: find the right skin product is like find the right shampoo, difficult
3/4/16, 14:53 - Cindy L: Ive discovered max factor and maybelline here to be pretty good
3/4/16, 14:53 - Cindy L: Cuz theyre not made in china
3/4/16, 14:53 - Mom: hahaha
3/4/16, 14:54 - Cindy L: Anyways did i tell u abt the entrepreneur panel i went to
3/4/16, 14:55 - Mom: no
3/4/16, 14:55 - Mom: what is it?
3/4/16, 14:55 - Cindy L: Like they had a bunch of post grad startup foundera
3/4/16, 14:55 - Cindy L: Founders
3/4/16, 14:55 - Cindy L: And they talked abt how the built their stuff
3/4/16, 14:56 - Mom: they're looking for investment opportunities?
3/4/16, 14:56 - Cindy L: Well i duno there
3/4/16, 14:56 - Cindy L: But everyone wants to be a steve jobs today
3/4/16, 14:56 - Cindy L: Or the wolf of wall street
3/4/16, 14:57 - Mom: cuz this is the only one can become rich overnight
3/4/16, 14:57 - Cindy L: Lol and because lse ppl have no actual scientific or tech knowledge
3/4/16, 14:57 - Cindy L: There is this thing called social entrepreneurs here
3/4/16, 14:58 - Mom: and this is why pyramid scheme still works
3/4/16, 14:59 - Cindy L: Oh man, the pyramid scheme is alive and well here
3/4/16, 14:59 - Cindy L: So many companies recruit uni students as 'brand ambassadors'
3/4/16, 14:59 - Mom: so i always negate a normal person to do soci sci deg
3/4/16, 14:59 - Cindy L: Basically get ur friends to promote our company
3/4/16, 15:00 - Cindy L: And they hv these cresit collection systems where if u invite friends u get credit and can exchange for money
3/4/16, 15:00 - Mom: but what can they do without professional knowledge?
3/4/16, 15:00 - Cindy L: I mean this is basically ponzi scheme, why is this legal
3/4/16, 15:00 - Mom: this is the fastest way to stay alive with a reasonable income
3/4/16, 15:01 - Cindy L: Yea
3/4/16, 15:01 - Mom: technically, they're not illegal
3/4/16, 15:01 - Cindy L: Well its not multi level marketing so i guess not
3/4/16, 15:01 - Mom: so ppl just use these loopholes to make money
3/4/16, 15:02 - Mom: sort of la
3/4/16, 15:02 - Cindy L: In japan they screw u over by making ppl buy huge quotas of their product and sell to other ppl
3/4/16, 15:02 - Mom: that is the law?
3/4/16, 15:02 - Cindy L: No its illegal
3/4/16, 15:03 - Cindy L: But business crime is hard to catch
3/4/16, 15:03 - Cindy L: Like internet crime and a lot of other crime....
3/4/16, 15:03 - Mom: u mean the law says it's a criminal offence and subject to punishment
3/4/16, 15:03 - Cindy L: Yea
3/4/16, 15:04 - Mom: internet crime is sooooooo professional
3/4/16, 15:04 - Cindy L: Anyways back to the startups
3/4/16, 15:04 - Mom: and requires so much profesional knowledga and skills
3/4/16, 15:04 - Cindy L: Yeah u mean hacking, theres lots of online courses for that
3/4/16, 15:05 - Mom: i mean to catch the hacking and put them in criminal proceedings
3/4/16, 15:05 - Cindy L: Oh
3/4/16, 15:05 - Cindy L: Yea u gotta be a hacker urself
3/4/16, 15:06 - Cindy L: But like a lot of comp sci is similar to neurosci
3/4/16, 15:06 - Cindy L: Esp regarding data processing and networks
3/4/16, 15:06 - Cindy L: I guess thats cuz the brain is technically a computer
3/4/16, 15:06 - Cindy L: A supercomputer
3/4/16, 15:07 - Mom: ok back to ur entrepreneur event?
3/4/16, 15:07 - Cindy L: Lol
3/4/16, 15:07 - Mom: what's it?
3/4/16, 15:07 - Cindy L: Ok so basically super disappointinf
3/4/16, 15:08 - Mom: why?
3/4/16, 15:08 - Cindy L: Just a lot of people HIRING other people to build apps
3/4/16, 15:08 - Cindy L: And the ideas arent even that inspiring
3/4/16, 15:09 - Cindy L: I mean like who needs an app to show them their bank account details in nice pictures and graphs
3/4/16, 15:09 - Cindy L: And who needs an app where you use to see whats happening on campus
3/4/16, 15:10 - Mom: u think there're hundreds of steve jobs?
3/4/16, 15:10 - Cindy L: There was a duo who ran an entrepreneur training workshop and they call themselves entrepreneurs cuz of that
3/4/16, 15:10 - Cindy L: üòë
3/4/16, 15:11 - Cindy L: Yea i know there are not hundreds of steve jobs, but these arent even long term business ideas
3/4/16, 15:11 - Cindy L: Feels like to me start ups are just the newest financial products
3/4/16, 15:12 - Mom: that's why start ups used to fail
3/4/16, 15:12 - Cindy L: Where investors dump some money in each season to see if they are lucky
3/4/16, 15:12 - Cindy L: Its like bloody horse racing.
3/4/16, 15:12 - Mom: err, probably another financial products developed by those wall street ppl
3/4/16, 15:12 - Cindy L: So i left promptly after that
3/4/16, 15:12 - Cindy L: I dont wanna be involved im horse racing
3/4/16, 15:13 - Cindy L: At least as a banker there is long term progression
3/4/16, 15:13 - Mom: "horsing racing" üòÇüòÇ
3/4/16, 15:14 - Cindy L: I mean seriously
3/4/16, 15:14 - Cindy L: If u think abt it
3/4/16, 15:15 - Cindy L: Formula 1 is a team of engineers work to produce a good car to race against other cars
3/4/16, 15:15 - Cindy L: And then a bunch of rich ppl gamble over them each season
3/4/16, 15:16 - Cindy L: Or like football, u put together a good team and a bunch gamblers again
3/4/16, 15:16 - Cindy L: Startups exactly the same.
3/4/16, 15:17 - Mom: u know these days, emos and i were talking abt how useless of the sports
3/4/16, 15:17 - Cindy L: To be fair u can make a lot of money like this
3/4/16, 15:17 - Mom: we thought they didn't add any value the well being of the society
3/4/16, 15:18 - Cindy L: Actually sports boost societal cohesion
3/4/16, 15:18 - Cindy L: Theyre suppose to make u feel part of a group.
3/4/16, 15:18 - Cindy L: Thats the point of sport
3/4/16, 15:18 - Mom: what who actually cares abt social cohesion or team work? they just care abt the money
3/4/16, 15:19 - Cindy L: Politicians do
3/4/16, 15:19 - Cindy L: Lol
3/4/16, 15:19 - Cindy L: I sat through so many lectures abt voting strategy
3/4/16, 15:20 - Cindy L: To get to the one abt economic policy
3/4/16, 15:20 - Cindy L: And they decided to lump it together with immigration
3/4/16, 15:20 - Cindy L: Fml üò≠
3/4/16, 17:35 - Cindy L: Mopps
3/4/16, 17:36 - Cindy L: Did u hv any strange dreams around this time?
3/4/16, 18:04 - Mom: not rlly strange but sort of more dreams these days
3/4/16, 18:04 - Mom: ofc not as exciting as urs
3/4/16, 18:05 - Mom: can't rmb now, even though i did have rmb them immediate after wake up
3/4/16, 18:25 - Mom: u had me in ur dream again?
3/5/16, 12:33 - Cindy L: Yes someone who looks like u
3/5/16, 12:33 - Cindy L: From the future
3/5/16, 12:33 - Cindy L: Might be me
3/5/16, 12:34 - Cindy L: It was like a skype call but no sound
3/5/16, 12:35 - Cindy L: And then strangely the dream was really stable
3/5/16, 12:36 - Cindy L: I had full control over wat i was doing, so this is 1st person
3/5/16, 12:36 - Cindy L: And then i asked this person what time it was
3/5/16, 12:36 - Cindy L: And what was the date
3/5/16, 12:38 - Cindy L: So signalled that it was 7pm
3/5/16, 12:38 - Cindy L: And then she wrote out the date
3/5/16, 12:39 - Cindy L: Which was 28/06/2#06
3/5/16, 12:40 - Mom: 2#06? a future date?
3/5/16, 12:40 - Cindy L: I suspect it was 2406
3/5/16, 12:40 - Cindy L: But now thinking back
3/5/16, 12:40 - Cindy L: I couldnt see quite clearly what the second digit was
3/5/16, 12:40 - Cindy L: Cuz it was scribbled over
3/5/16, 12:41 - Mom: ic
3/5/16, 12:41 - Cindy L: Unless u talked to future me in 2006 through a dream
3/5/16, 12:41 - Mom: 2006? u were 9 yrs old
3/5/16, 12:42 - Cindy L: It would be u then
3/5/16, 12:42 - Cindy L: The person only looked like u
3/5/16, 12:42 - Cindy L: It could hv been me
3/5/16, 12:42 - Cindy L: Like as in future me
3/5/16, 12:42 - Mom: what did that person say?
3/5/16, 12:42 - Cindy L: Nothing
3/5/16, 12:43 - Cindy L: No sound
3/5/16, 12:43 - Cindy L: Just miming
3/5/16, 12:43 - Cindy L: But i felt the connection that i was related to this person
3/5/16, 12:43 - Mom: look like me now or younger me?
3/5/16, 12:44 - Cindy L: Younger i would say
3/5/16, 12:44 - Cindy L: But the brown desk is still there
3/5/16, 12:45 - Cindy L: So it could be 2006
3/5/16, 12:45 - Mom: wow, i was sitting in front of the brown desk in my room?
3/5/16, 12:45 - Cindy L: U were sitting at desk, not sure abt in the room or not
3/5/16, 12:46 - Cindy L: I didnt see surroundings
3/5/16, 12:46 - Cindy L: Cuz as soon as i tried to remember the date, i lost connection
3/5/16, 12:46 - Mom: is that dream from ur night time sleep or afternoon nap?
3/5/16, 12:46 - Cindy L: Afternoon
3/5/16, 12:47 - Cindy L: Its when i asked whether you had a strange dream
3/5/16, 12:47 - Mom: what's that person's attitude? angry? peace or else?
3/5/16, 12:47 - Mom: c
3/5/16, 12:47 - Cindy L: Normal?
3/5/16, 12:48 - Mom: wud it be ur memory of me in ur childhood?
3/5/16, 12:48 - Cindy L: Like they seembto know wjat was happening
3/5/16, 12:48 - Cindy L: Hmmm
3/5/16, 12:48 - Cindy L: Maybe
3/5/16, 12:48 - Cindy L: But rems arent related to content of memories
3/5/16, 12:48 - Cindy L: Dreama
3/5/16, 12:49 - Mom: isn't it?
3/5/16, 12:49 - Mom: i'll check
3/5/16, 12:50 - Cindy L: They r byproducts of reactivation of the different parts of the brain involved in encoding memory
3/5/16, 12:50 - Cindy L: Apparently
3/5/16, 13:02 - Mom: how's ur day?
3/5/16, 13:44 - Cindy L: Just woke up
3/5/16, 13:44 - Cindy L: Loooloo
3/5/16, 13:49 - Cindy L: I looked at subjects left in extra yesterday
3/5/16, 13:49 - Cindy L: V. Weird
3/5/16, 13:49 - Cindy L: Even imperial has quite a number of courses there
3/5/16, 13:56 - Mom: but those courses r usually pure sci right?
3/5/16, 13:56 - Mom: or useless?
3/5/16, 14:21 - Cindy L: Theyre like biotech
3/5/16, 14:21 - Cindy L: And bme
3/5/16, 14:21 - Cindy L: I was just looking out of interest
3/5/16, 14:24 - Cindy L: Anyways i found this article which finally explains how emotion triggers muscle tone
3/5/16, 14:24 - Cindy L: Its from boston med school i think
3/5/16, 14:24 - Cindy L: Published 2012
3/5/16, 14:26 - Cindy L: So basically its the absence of orexin which leds to the lack of an inhibitory signal which counters this other signal from the amygdala
3/5/16, 14:27 - Cindy L: Anyways yah, no help there unless someone invents an orexin agonist
3/5/16, 14:28 - Cindy L: Anyways it mentioned something abt memory so i read up on memory encoding on wiki
3/5/16, 14:28 - Cindy L: So the hippocampus encodes memories
3/5/16, 14:29 - Cindy L: So memories are made in the hippocampus, but only stores in there temporarily
3/5/16, 14:30 - Cindy L: When u go into sws, basically ur brain transfers all of this data to the neocortex into a moee permanent form
3/5/16, 14:30 - Cindy L: So thats long term memory
3/5/16, 14:30 - Cindy L: But this is a long process and the brain does this basically through repetition
3/5/16, 14:31 - Cindy L: Like learning, it reactivates the relevant corteces
3/5/16, 14:31 - Cindy L: Anyways
3/5/16, 14:31 - Cindy L: Back to my case
3/5/16, 14:31 - Cindy L: Since i dont really go into sws
3/5/16, 14:31 - Cindy L: What the fuck is going to happen to memories
3/5/16, 14:32 - Mom: did ur long term memory hurt?
3/5/16, 14:32 - Cindy L: Hurt?
3/5/16, 14:33 - Cindy L: I think its definitely not going to be as good as before
3/5/16, 14:33 - Mom: i mean u can't rlly put ur ST learning skills into LT memorues
3/5/16, 14:33 - Cindy L: Given the michaelmas exam
3/5/16, 14:33 - Cindy L: But thats how the brain stores memories
3/5/16, 14:33 - Cindy L: Or else they disappear from the hipppcampus
3/5/16, 14:35 - Cindy L: So that probably means i better start logging every single thing which happens
3/5/16, 14:35 - Mom: hahaha
3/5/16, 14:35 - Mom: scare of losing everything like me?
3/5/16, 14:36 - Cindy L: Shit
3/5/16, 14:39 - Cindy L: This is not funny, im srsly worried abt forgetting everything from now onwards
3/5/16, 14:40 - Cindy L: I already barely remember anything before p3
3/5/16, 14:44 - Mom: don't Ëá™Â∑±ÂöáËá™Â∑±
3/5/16, 14:45 - Mom: u shud have ur memories b4 p3 cuz they're in ur LT memory
3/5/16, 14:45 - Mom: it's just nothing special enough for u to easy recall them except the high fever instance, right?
3/5/16, 14:46 - Mom: also we sometimes need aids to help recall LT memories like pic or old stuff
3/5/16, 14:47 - Mom: that's why i want to keep those stuff to help me recall things
3/5/16, 14:47 - Mom: take more pic to help u recall memories in case
3/5/16, 14:49 - Mom: actually we only spend abt 25% of the sleep time in sws stage
3/5/16, 14:57 - Cindy L: Ok
3/5/16, 14:58 - Cindy L: Sigh
3/5/16, 14:59 - Cindy L: On a positive note, i met a guy who does gov and i think i understand the point of gov now
3/5/16, 14:59 - Mom: what's it?
3/5/16, 15:00 - Cindy L: Well u mostly learn abt strategy
3/5/16, 15:00 - Cindy L: Yr 2 is game theory
3/5/16, 15:01 - Cindy L: So jobs u do is related to lobbying and pr and media
3/5/16, 15:01 - Mom: so u have a clearer picture now?
3/5/16, 15:01 - Cindy L: Yeah
3/5/16, 15:01 - Cindy L: I get why i choose this course
3/5/16, 15:01 - Cindy L: Lol
3/5/16, 15:01 - Cindy L: Accidentally
3/5/16, 15:02 - Mom: this is also the reason i don't understand why u chose this course cuz i didn't realize that ur that kind of person
3/5/16, 15:03 - Mom: ur totally not a person of playing tricks and want to manipulate things
3/5/16, 15:03 - Cindy L: But u learn how to bribe people ans who u need to bribe off
3/5/16, 15:03 - Cindy L: Literally
3/5/16, 15:03 - Cindy L: I can see a corporate application for this
3/5/16, 15:03 - Mom: u don't have to learn it in uni
3/5/16, 15:03 - Mom: ppl just know how to do it naturally
3/5/16, 15:04 - Cindy L: Not really
3/5/16, 15:04 - Mom: why?
3/5/16, 15:04 - Cindy L: Not everybody can win the liar game
3/5/16, 15:04 - Mom: u can win the game if ur that type of person, not to learn to win ur life liar game
3/5/16, 15:05 - Cindy L: Right
3/5/16, 15:05 - Cindy L: I see ur point
3/5/16, 15:05 - Cindy L: I guess its fun
3/5/16, 15:05 - Cindy L: For a shitty person
3/5/16, 15:05 - Mom: def not
3/5/16, 15:06 - Mom: even the shitty person like 689, he's going to live in extreme fright state
3/5/16, 15:06 - Cindy L: Oh yea, the gov guy said its nerve wracking
3/5/16, 15:07 - Mom: politic is not fun
3/5/16, 15:07 - Mom: i rlly hate it
3/5/16, 15:07 - Cindy L: Yea u never know whos gonna stab u in the back
3/5/16, 15:07 - Cindy L: And u gotta keep track of all those interest groups
3/5/16, 15:07 - Mom: u know cuz everybody wud stab u in the back and always want to
3/5/16, 15:07 - Cindy L: And u always make enemies cuz u cant please everybody
3/5/16, 15:08 - Cindy L: And in the end u hv to be resort to corruption cuz rhats the only way to get things done
3/5/16, 15:09 - Cindy L: Lololol
3/5/16, 15:09 - Mom: think abt it: u always have to earn all the money and power to get everything under control, wud this be easy?
3/5/16, 15:09 - Mom: and once ur in bad luck, ur going to get kick out the world
3/5/16, 15:09 - Mom: life is not like that
3/5/16, 15:10 - Cindy L: But u dont become a politician
3/5/16, 15:10 - Cindy L: U just be a political consultant
3/5/16, 15:11 - Mom: yea right political consulant like those learned scholars in old chinese time
3/5/16, 15:11 - Cindy L: Ok... Elaborate
3/5/16, 15:11 - Mom: Êà∞ÂúãÊôÇ‰ª£
3/5/16, 15:13 - Cindy L: ....
3/5/16, 15:13 - Cindy L: I mean what did they do
3/5/16, 15:13 - Mom: rmb in that time, there were lots of war lords, those learned scholars travelled around different counties to persuade war lords to adapt their theories
3/5/16, 15:13 - Cindy L: Yea
3/5/16, 15:13 - Cindy L: It s kind of the other way round now though
3/5/16, 15:14 - Mom: almost the same
3/5/16, 15:14 - Cindy L: U go to a company to get advice
3/5/16, 15:14 - Mom: if u can't find a boss who buy ur idea/concepts, what else can u do?
3/5/16, 15:14 - Cindy L: I swear before i came to lse i didnt even know what consultancy was
3/5/16, 15:14 - Cindy L: And how u can make a living off that
3/5/16, 15:15 - Mom: i know exactly
3/5/16, 15:15 - Mom: be a consultant
3/5/16, 15:15 - Mom: govt consultant or business consultant
3/5/16, 15:16 - Mom: even the dual ba course do similar thing, and grads will do similar consultancy jobs
3/5/16, 15:16 - Cindy L: Well yea, what else can u do with social sci knowledge
3/5/16, 15:16 - Mom: basically nothing
3/5/16, 15:17 - Mom: except consultancy jobs like media
3/5/16, 15:17 - Mom: ppl with soc sci deg used to go into govt like be an AO/EO in hk
3/5/16, 15:18 - Cindy L: Right
3/5/16, 15:18 - Cindy L: But these jobs r chill on workload
3/5/16, 15:18 - Mom: this is the dream job of everybody cuz there ppl can access to classified info and the centre of power
3/5/16, 15:18 - Cindy L: And r good for ppl who like to talk abt trump and bernie over dinner
3/5/16, 15:19 - Mom: yea, u have to know how to manipulate ppl
3/5/16, 15:19 - Mom: 100 marks
3/5/16, 15:19 - Cindy L: Thats true
3/5/16, 15:19 - Cindy L: Fair enough
3/5/16, 15:19 - Mom: so honestly, ru that type of person?
3/5/16, 15:20 - Mom: ok back to ur michaelmas term exam, i think u didn't do it good
3/5/16, 15:20 - Cindy L: Yeah it was bad
3/5/16, 15:20 - Mom: the reason is not abt ur memories prob, instead how much time and effort u've put into ur studies?
3/5/16, 15:21 - Cindy L: üôÄ
3/5/16, 15:21 - Cindy L: It was multichoice
3/5/16, 15:21 - Mom: i think u have spent all the time readin neurosci materials instead of the courseworks
3/5/16, 15:22 - Cindy L: Yea....
3/5/16, 15:22 - Mom: even mc needs proper info
3/5/16, 15:22 - Mom: u barely have gone through enough materials
3/5/16, 15:23 - Cindy L: .....
3/5/16, 15:24 - Mom: i can imagine that u spent every minute on those neurosci materials and just completed ur coursework in one or two days b4 deadline
3/5/16, 15:24 - Mom: so if u still can get great result, was it reasonable?
3/5/16, 15:24 - Mom: ur not a born politician
3/5/16, 15:26 - Mom: take ur time to schedule a proper time table between ur courseworks and those neurosci thingy
3/5/16, 15:27 - Mom: it's time to manage ur life, in the past u didn't organise ur time effectively
3/5/16, 15:27 - Mom: u just do things randomly or according to skl's deadline
3/5/16, 15:28 - Mom: i think the reason is u didn't have a life objective: u don't fight for skl results, don't fight for money and didn't even think of the career
3/5/16, 15:29 - Cindy L: Sure
3/5/16, 15:30 - Mom: sadly this is a typical middle class kid's life
3/5/16, 15:31 - Mom: everything is prepared by their parents
3/5/16, 15:31 - Mom: if their parents r aggressive persons, then the kids wud be push to do lots of thing in according to parents' plan
3/5/16, 15:32 - Mom: like those of ur kgv's schoolmates
3/5/16, 16:21 - Mom: i trust that if u can put more time on ur lse subj, u could still achieve good results
3/5/16, 16:21 - Mom: rmb that these results affect ur possibility to transfer to us uni
3/5/16, 16:31 - Cindy L: Yea yea
3/6/16, 05:28 - Cindy L: Yea postmeal hallucinations r gonna be a consistent thing from now on
3/6/16, 07:02 - Mom: what did u see?
3/6/16, 07:34 - Mom: did u hallucinate after eating all sort of food?
3/6/16, 07:45 - Cindy L: I heard voices again
3/6/16, 07:46 - Cindy L: I remember thinking that my head was like a radio receiver
3/6/16, 07:46 - Cindy L: And then i dont know what exactlt happened for a while
3/6/16, 07:47 - Cindy L: I was looking for a place to sleep for a while
3/6/16, 07:48 - Cindy L: And then when i came bck to reality i was very unhappy and i dunno why
3/6/16, 07:49 - Cindy L: This sort of happens after every meal i eat after breakfast
3/6/16, 07:52 - Mom: for bkf only? did it happen in lunchtime or after dinner?
3/6/16, 07:53 - Mom: and u said u heard voices, it that the actual sound u heard?
3/6/16, 07:53 - Mom: or just like electric waves?
3/6/16, 08:08 - Cindy L: No i meant meals after breakfast as in post lunch and dinner
3/6/16, 08:09 - Cindy L: Yes i heard like many different voices, they kept changing, saying different things and in different languages
3/6/16, 08:09 - Cindy L: And they kept changing like someone was changing channels thats why i felt like a radio
3/6/16, 08:11 - Cindy L: And at the same time, there is this sensation in my head which starts separating me from reality, so much that when the voices stop i forget that i am in london already and i only know what is in my immediate surroundings cuz i can sense them
3/6/16, 08:13 - Mom: sorry what do u mean: "i can sense them"? what is it?
3/6/16, 08:14 - Mom: so at least 3 times hallucinations everyday after meals right?
3/6/16, 08:14 - Mom: what if u didn't eat? still hallucinate?
3/6/16, 08:15 - Cindy L: 2, post lunch and post dinner. After breakfast i usually go back to sleep the 3rd session
3/6/16, 08:16 - Cindy L: No if i dont eat, less chances of getting a hallucination. Only when i use the computers
3/6/16, 08:17 - Mom: sigh
3/6/16, 08:18 - Cindy L: I think it has to do with size of the meal
3/6/16, 08:18 - Cindy L: So i started eating half portions
3/6/16, 08:18 - Cindy L: But that means i hv to eat more meals
3/6/16, 08:19 - Cindy L: So basically im just snacking all the time
3/6/16, 08:19 - Mom: no don't do that
3/6/16, 08:19 - Mom: u'll get fat with snacking
3/6/16, 08:19 - Mom: eat potatoes which make u full with only a few portion
3/6/16, 08:19 - Cindy L: Ok
3/6/16, 08:20 - Cindy L: Potatoes is carbs right
3/6/16, 08:20 - Mom: yea, ur stomach feels better
3/6/16, 08:20 - Cindy L: Im literally having soba noodles for every meal now
3/6/16, 08:21 - Mom: soba noodles r still carbs
3/6/16, 08:21 - Mom: nothing different from potatoes
3/6/16, 08:21 - Cindy L: Yes so its not type of food
3/6/16, 08:21 - Cindy L: Cuz no matter ehat i eat i get hallucinations
3/6/16, 08:22 - Mom: this is weird
3/6/16, 08:22 - Mom: did this happen when ur in hk?
3/6/16, 08:22 - Mom: and since when u get hallucinations after eating in london?
3/6/16, 08:23 - Cindy L: Like  these few months since jan i think
3/6/16, 08:23 - Cindy L: Ive onlyy been logging since jan
3/6/16, 08:23 - Mom: logging? running?
3/6/16, 08:23 - Cindy L: In hk after every meal i use to collapse
3/6/16, 08:24 - Cindy L: Logging as in keeping track of everything
3/6/16, 08:25 - Mom: ok, i'll google it to see if i can find anything
3/6/16, 08:27 - Cindy L: Sure
3/6/16, 08:28 - Cindy L: The onlt similarity i can think of is when my friends dog had seizures when it ate too much
3/6/16, 08:28 - Mom: i know dog wud have cataplexy after meal
3/6/16, 08:29 - Cindy L: Well the dog died eventually.
3/6/16, 08:29 - Mom: ok la, don't think of those thing la
3/6/16, 08:29 - Cindy L: Hahahaha
3/6/16, 08:30 - Cindy L: Dogs dont hv a long life span anyways
3/6/16, 08:30 - Cindy L: And it was old
3/6/16, 08:30 - Mom: how long a dog lives?
3/6/16, 08:35 - Cindy L: Dunno
3/6/16, 08:35 - Cindy L: 10~20 years im guessing
3/6/16, 08:36 - Mom: ok la, don't think of that dog la
3/6/16, 09:55 - Cindy L: Todays prophecy
3/6/16, 09:56 - Mom: what?
3/6/16, 09:56 - Cindy L: Nothing i thought i could predict the future
3/6/16, 09:57 - Cindy L: I got it all wrongüòí
3/6/16, 09:57 - Mom: üòëüòë
3/6/16, 10:16 - Cindy L: U wanna know though?
3/6/16, 10:18 - Cindy L: Last weeks failed prophecy
I dreamt that the white guy next door had a crazy booze party which didnt come true though.
3/6/16, 10:22 - Cindy L: This weeks failed prophecy
Dad takes out 26k for mysterious project. I see two versions of u - older and younger. The younger one is emotional and unhappy about it, but the older one is super rational and doesnt give shits, but shit wants to know what hes doing with the 26k
3/6/16, 10:22 - Cindy L: *she wants
3/6/16, 10:25 - Mom: ur two versions of me did match with the reality of me
3/6/16, 10:25 - Cindy L: Hahshahaha
3/6/16, 10:25 - Mom: perhaps ur dad did take out 26k for his project which i didn't rlly want to know
3/6/16, 10:26 - Cindy L: Im a shaman in training.
3/6/16, 10:27 - Mom: it seems that ur prophecy were only from ur memories + creativity
3/6/16, 10:28 - Cindy L: üòí
3/6/16, 10:28 - Mom: ru scare when u hear voices?
3/6/16, 10:29 - Cindy L: Yah a bit when i understand them
3/6/16, 10:29 - Cindy L: But i know they r hallucinations anyways
3/6/16, 10:29 - Mom: have u tried to communicate with them?
3/6/16, 10:30 - Cindy L: No, They havent attacked me yet so thats fine.
3/6/16, 10:30 - Cindy L: No i dont want to talk to them thank you very much
3/6/16, 10:30 - Cindy L: And i probably cant
3/6/16, 10:31 - Cindy L: Im not sure, i think my body goes into atonia during it so i cant control it anyways
3/6/16, 10:32 - Cindy L: At least im not as bad as the guy next door. He has chronic sp and sees stuff which attack him.
3/6/16, 10:33 - Mom: u mean those things just appeared in ur mindset and stay still there right?
3/6/16, 10:34 - Cindy L: Yes
3/6/16, 10:35 - Cindy L: Anyways i know why im hearing stuff its cuz the amgdala is mostly involved in audio encoding of memories
3/6/16, 10:36 - Mom: so those sound was actually ur memories?
3/6/16, 11:24 - Cindy L: Dunno
3/6/16, 11:26 - Cindy L: Ok ive identitfied a pulling feeling on the lower back of my hea during rhese weird episodes
3/6/16, 11:27 - Mom: where?
3/6/16, 11:27 - Cindy L: Or pulsating
3/6/16, 11:27 - Cindy L: On the back of my head
3/6/16, 11:27 - Cindy L: Where the brainstem is
3/6/16, 11:28 - Mom: at the medulla oblongata
3/6/16, 11:28 - Mom: what eps has these feelings?
3/6/16, 11:28 - Cindy L: YeA
3/6/16, 11:29 - Cindy L: During Post meal hallucinations
3/6/16, 11:29 - Cindy L: And me using the computer sometimes i get them
3/6/16, 11:29 - Mom: what position is ur head at the moment? blending or straight?
3/6/16, 11:30 - Cindy L: Its very annoying cuz it feels bad
3/6/16, 11:30 - Cindy L: Normal position? Upright

3/6/16, 11:31 - Cindy L: And i cant control my body
3/6/16, 11:31 - Mom: have u tried massaging that area during hallucinations?
3/6/16, 11:31 - Cindy L: I cant move
3/6/16, 11:32 - Mom: not even opening/closing ur eyes?
3/6/16, 11:33 - Cindy L: I enter a state of altered consciousness
3/6/16, 11:33 - Cindy L: So difficult to observe
3/6/16, 11:33 - Mom: c
3/6/16, 11:33 - Cindy L: Personally i dont even know whats happening.
3/6/16, 11:34 - Cindy L: But this is the state i have been trying to describe for a very long time.
3/6/16, 11:35 - Mom: next time when u eat ur lunch or dinner, can u skype me and turn on ur camera, so that i can see the whole process?
3/6/16, 11:36 - Cindy L: er i can try recording it maybe that will be easier
3/6/16, 11:36 - Mom: okay
3/6/16, 12:54 - Cindy L: ok i just went to a dream where it was in the afternoon around 3 or 4 pm
3/6/16, 12:54 - Cindy L: and now i woke up it's 1
3/6/16, 12:54 - Cindy L: super disorientating
3/6/16, 12:56 - Cindy L: if u ever read flatland, i feel like the poor square who accidentally went into the 3d world
3/6/16, 12:57 - Mom: is there any hint in ur dream indicating the time 3 or 4 pm?
3/6/16, 12:58 - Cindy L: it just felt like 3 or 4 and we were gonna cook noodles for late lunch
3/6/16, 12:58 - Cindy L: but it felt much later in the afternoon cuz the room was darker
3/6/16, 12:59 - Cindy L: i'm saying that i know for a fact it was in the afternoon and not that i'm guessing that it was.
3/6/16, 13:00 - Cindy L: just not sure how i know
3/6/16, 13:00 - Mom: i think it's just ur not accustomed to the uk time, so u had this misperception abt time
3/6/16, 13:01 - Cindy L: perhaps
3/6/16, 13:01 - Cindy L: so i gained two hrs.
3/6/16, 13:01 - Mom: u know the sunlight always has great impact on ppl's circadian clock
3/6/16, 13:02 - Cindy L: yeah
3/6/16, 13:02 - Mom: i bet u didn't watch the time when u did ur cooking
3/6/16, 13:02 - Cindy L: u mean this morning?
3/6/16, 13:02 - Mom: i mean today?
3/6/16, 13:03 - Cindy L: or do u mean in the dream?
3/6/16, 13:03 - Cindy L: i was cooking noodles in the dream
3/6/16, 13:03 - Mom: i mean in reality
3/6/16, 13:03 - Cindy L: i cooked porridge this morning and soba noodles just now
3/6/16, 13:03 - Mom: u didn't cook anything?
3/6/16, 13:04 - Mom: ohhhh, so u sleep b4 lunch
3/6/16, 13:04 - Cindy L: yea
3/6/16, 13:04 - Mom: ic
3/6/16, 13:04 - Cindy L: i think it's a continuation of the earlier episode
3/6/16, 13:05 - Mom: continuation?
3/6/16, 13:05 - Cindy L: like after i heard the voices this morning and felt the pulsation and went into a dream and came back
3/6/16, 13:05 - Cindy L: that's part 1
3/6/16, 13:06 - Cindy L: and part 2 happened like 1hr and a half later
3/6/16, 13:06 - Mom: but they're not related
3/6/16, 13:06 - Mom: can u see any relationship between them?
3/6/16, 13:07 - Cindy L: yea the dreams aren't connected
3/6/16, 13:07 - Cindy L: but part 2 happened without stimulus
3/6/16, 13:07 - Mom: if u did ur cooking now, then u shud have finished ur lunch by 3 or 4 pm
3/6/16, 13:08 - Mom: then ur dream is just a reflection of ur normal events, right?
3/6/16, 13:08 - Cindy L: erm no i takes me 10 minutes to cook.
3/6/16, 13:08 - Cindy L: i just make soba

3/6/16, 13:41 - Cindy L: consumer spending is good
3/6/16, 13:44 - Mom: yea, more consumption, more jobs
3/6/16, 13:45 - Cindy L: i can now draw graphs to prove this
3/6/16, 13:45 - Mom: üëç
3/6/16, 22:51 - Mom: why?
3/6/16, 22:52 - Cindy L: Why what?
3/6/16, 23:14 - Mom: i mean why u say cuhk med looks like a blast? what made u say that?
3/6/16, 23:53 - Cindy L: Oh i deleted the msg so i thought u wouldnt get it
3/6/16, 23:54 - Cindy L: Lol i just saw hmans posts on fb and shes in france
3/6/16, 23:54 - Cindy L: I was just thinking that she sure has a lot of free time for a med student....
3/6/16, 23:55 - Cindy L: Even more than a social sciences student sometimes....
3/7/16, 00:23 - Mom: What? someone from cuhk med jumped and someone had so much free time?
3/7/16, 00:24 - Mom: It's weird
3/7/16, 00:26 - Cindy L: Jumped?
3/7/16, 00:28 - Cindy L: By a blast, i meant cu med looks like a chill course
3/7/16, 00:28 - Cindy L: Cuz i know tiffany also does med and last time i heard abt her was that she always goes to lkf to party....
3/7/16, 00:29 - Mom: u didn't know that? A med student from cuhk jumped to dead just a few days ago
3/7/16, 00:30 - Cindy L: Oh really?
3/7/16, 00:30 - Cindy L: That happens a lot at imperial
3/7/16, 00:30 - Cindy L: So its not really news...
3/7/16, 00:30 - Cindy L: Ahhahaha
3/7/16, 00:30 - Mom: yea, not just one, 5 from cuhk did that this academic yr
3/7/16, 00:31 - Cindy L: Oh wow, well tbh theres probably not very good mental health service on campus
3/7/16, 00:32 - Cindy L: Imperial has pays a lot of effort to prevent their kids from falling into depression
3/7/16, 00:32 - Cindy L: From what i know.
3/7/16, 00:33 - Cindy L: Lol
3/7/16, 00:33 - Cindy L: Maybe first year is chill
3/7/16, 00:33 - Cindy L: I meant heiman is alway travelling.
3/7/16, 00:33 - Cindy L: Shes even travelling even more than i do to europe
3/7/16, 00:35 - Cindy L: But tbh i feel that theres a shift of attitude to 'time to study and get shit done' around here these days
3/7/16, 00:35 - Cindy L: Even the friday drinking parties hv declined
3/7/16, 00:37 - Cindy L: Hahaha, i mean even i hv started to work
3/7/16, 00:38 - Mom: This is normal cuz u guys still have to graduate with gd honors
3/7/16, 00:38 - Cindy L: Sigh, some ppl are sooo lucky
3/7/16, 00:39 - Mom: ....
3/7/16, 00:40 - Cindy L: üòíüòíüòíüòí
3/7/16, 00:40 - Cindy L: Though i hv even more serious doubts abt hk doctors now
3/7/16, 00:41 - Mom: ....
3/7/16, 00:41 - Cindy L: I mean first yr med is supposed to be tough
3/7/16, 00:42 - Cindy L: Like oscar said, u enter uni as a noob and they only have a few years to cram all that medical knowledge and professional skill in ur brain....
3/7/16, 00:43 - Mom: As I know, med course is tough
3/7/16, 00:43 - Cindy L: I know so how do u find time to travel the world.... üòíüòíüòíüòíüòíüòí
3/7/16, 00:43 - Mom: many ppl hv to repeat during their stufy
3/7/16, 00:44 - Cindy L: üòíüòíüòíüòíüòíüòíüòí
3/7/16, 00:44 - Mom: maybe she's taking special leave
3/7/16, 00:44 - Cindy L: Lol maybe
3/7/16, 00:44 - Cindy L: Pull another depression out of her ass
3/7/16, 00:45 - Mom: I srly doubt if she had depression?????
3/7/16, 00:46 - Cindy L: This is my skeptical face üòíüòíüòíüòíüòíüòí
3/7/16, 00:46 - Cindy L: Totes agreed
3/7/16, 00:46 - Cindy L: Well then
3/7/16, 00:46 - Cindy L: Prozac is not that dangerous
3/7/16, 00:48 - Mom: But I wud wonder if she rlly need that
3/7/16, 00:48 - Cindy L: Shes the type that would finish all the pills the doctor gives u
3/7/16, 00:49 - Cindy L: So im pretty sure she took them
3/7/16, 00:52 - Cindy L: I wonder if those drugs hv that much side effect....... üòíüòíüòíüòíüòíüòíüòí
3/7/16, 00:52 - Cindy L: Most of the time they dont work
3/7/16, 00:53 - Cindy L: Even the adrafinil barely worked on me......
3/7/16, 00:58 - Mom: i think it's just ur not having that type of illness, so the drug didn't work
3/7/16, 00:59 - Mom: and abt the side effects, ofc for high dose and prolong time taken
3/7/16, 00:59 - Mom: but u rlly want to bet on ur own health?
3/7/16, 00:59 - Mom: btw is she a christian?
3/7/16, 01:00 - Cindy L: Well yea if u take for prolonged time like years u will develop tolerance/ addiction provblems but thats another issue
3/7/16, 01:00 - Cindy L: No ofc not
3/7/16, 01:00 - Cindy L: Adrafinil is suppose to hv awakening effects
3/7/16, 01:01 - Cindy L: I still went to sleep after taking it....
3/7/16, 01:01 - Cindy L: Like the ritalin.
3/7/16, 01:01 - Cindy L: I also had a coffee in the afternoon and i still slept in the evening
3/7/16, 01:02 - Mom: u know, there's a news that someone from china took 200 pcs sleeping pills to commit suicide but he's not dead, u know why?
3/7/16, 01:02 - Mom: cuz those drugs were fake
3/7/16, 01:02 - Cindy L: Lol
3/7/16, 01:02 - Cindy L: So i got fake ritalin?
3/7/16, 01:03 - Cindy L: Even if the adrafinil was fake fair enough
3/7/16, 01:03 - Cindy L: But the ritalin was def real
3/7/16, 01:03 - Mom: i had coffee every night b4 sleep, i still can fall asleep fast
3/7/16, 01:03 - Cindy L: Yea exactlyy point

3/7/16, 02:24 - Mom: u need more sleep b4 4 am
3/7/16, 02:24 - Cindy L: The induction stove always overcooks my egg though
3/7/16, 02:25 - Mom: ur making ur circadian clock not working la
3/7/16, 02:25 - Cindy L: I basically sleep uberman cycle

3/7/16, 02:26 - Mom: this is the prob with ur circadian clock, u c
3/7/16, 02:26 - Cindy L: Yea i know
3/7/16, 02:26 - Mom: ofc i know
3/7/16, 02:27 - Cindy L: Its kinda annoying that i basically wake up after 12

3/7/16, 02:28 - Mom: u mean 12 noon?

3/7/16, 02:30 - Mom: what if u had class in the morning from 9 to 12?
3/7/16, 02:30 - Cindy L: I think ive only managed to actuslly go to all the classes on thursday once
3/7/16, 02:32 - Mom: but actually, we are always awake during these period like now
3/7/16, 02:32 - Mom: even if ur not talking to friends or me, i bet ur watching other stuffs as well
3/7/16, 02:32 - Cindy L: No not at 2
3/7/16, 02:33 - Cindy L: Anyways I told u I don't really watch YouTube these days

3/7/16, 02:35 - Cindy L: Dw I will
3/7/16, 02:36 - Cindy L: If my sleep schedule messes up I hallucinate and get scary dreams like I'm high the next day
3/7/16, 02:36 - Mom: what u mean by "high"? like taking LSD?
3/7/16, 02:37 - Cindy L: As in so much more freq than usual

3/7/16, 11:14 - Cindy L: I wwas just looking at the imperial site for bme
3/7/16, 11:14 - Cindy L: And I realised I wrote a lot abt sensor technologies in my personal statement....
3/7/16, 11:15 - Cindy L: Which turns out is what BME does
3/7/16, 11:15 - Cindy L: Do u think I should bother sending them a supplement?
3/7/16, 13:13 - Mom: bme? that's for building equipments for patients right?
3/7/16, 13:14 - Mom: hey, ur dad has ur dropbox login/password, do u know?
3/7/16, 13:14 - Cindy L: Yea I know
3/7/16, 13:14 - Cindy L: Not during since most machines hv my Dropbox linked
3/7/16, 13:15 - Mom: that's on his mini ipad
3/7/16, 13:15 - Cindy L: Actually the BME courses looks pretty good
3/7/16, 13:15 - Mom: u used that b4?
3/7/16, 13:15 - Cindy L: I attached all machines to it.
3/7/16, 13:16 - Mom: even his computers?
3/7/16, 13:16 - Cindy L: Anyways I saw on Google cuz they send an email to me when u add a new one.
3/7/16, 13:16 - Mom: so do u need to delete it from his mini ipad?
3/7/16, 13:16 - Cindy L: Just logout
3/7/16, 13:17 - Mom: ok
3/7/16, 13:17 - Cindy L: It's under settings
3/7/16, 13:21 - Mom: so now is want to do bme?
3/7/16, 13:21 - Mom: does imperial accept additional supplements?
3/7/16, 13:22 - Cindy L: I kinda added it in later...
3/7/16, 13:22 - Mom: k
3/7/16, 13:22 - Cindy L: So I was late
3/7/16, 13:23 - Cindy L: And I haven't even gotten a response
3/7/16, 13:23 - Cindy L: But I saw the course was in extra
3/7/16, 13:23 - Cindy L: Which meant they hv spaces....
3/7/16, 13:23 - Mom: what's the deadline they need to give u a reply?
3/7/16, 13:24 - Mom: if the course is full, it's closed?
3/7/16, 13:24 - Cindy L: I dunno if there is one for late apps
3/7/16, 13:24 - Cindy L: Should I ask if they received my thing?
3/7/16, 13:24 - Mom: is there any response from ucas?
3/7/16, 13:24 - Cindy L: Yea it's on track
3/7/16, 13:25 - Mom: no updated?
3/7/16, 13:25 - Cindy L: Tbh last time I applied it took them like a whole month to acknowledge my app though
3/7/16, 13:25 - Cindy L: No
3/7/16, 13:26 - Mom: i think if u want to ensure ic rec'd ur app, u better ask if u have to supply any additional writings instead of just asking if they rec'd ur thing
3/7/16, 13:27 - Mom: this is to draw their attention abt ur app
3/7/16, 13:27 - Cindy L: Yea... I guess that'll be kinda dumb
3/7/16, 13:27 - Cindy L: Last time I emailed the ucl guy he was super casual though.
3/7/16, 13:28 - Mom: ucl is not imperial where u think ppl there r elites right?
3/7/16, 13:28 - Cindy L: I dont really know man.
3/7/16, 13:28 - Cindy L: Lse is sometimes like that too.
3/7/16, 13:29 - Mom: nvm la, if u rlly want to ask, ask in a more polite way
3/7/16, 13:29 - Mom: lse like what?
3/7/16, 13:29 - Mom: casual?
3/7/16, 13:29 - Cindy L: I was just wondering should I bother with amending my app...
3/7/16, 13:29 - Mom: how to amend?
3/7/16, 13:30 - Mom: u have submitted it already
3/7/16, 13:30 - Mom: amend options/uni?
3/7/16, 13:30 - Cindy L: No like email them and send them an amended one
3/7/16, 13:30 - Mom: amended ps?
3/7/16, 13:31 - Mom: yea, u can ask if they need one
3/7/16, 13:31 - Mom: cuz i know some uni does take additional ps
3/7/16, 13:32 - Cindy L: I just also realize NW asks for the least things for transfer.
3/7/16, 13:32 - Mom: what they ask?
3/7/16, 13:33 - Cindy L: 1 ref transcripts sats essays and college report
3/7/16, 13:33 - Mom: same as others?
3/7/16, 13:34 - Cindy L: No others need mid term reports and other stuff
3/7/16, 13:34 - Mom: just ref not the same?
3/7/16, 13:34 - Mom: so what is college report?
3/7/16, 13:35 - Cindy L: The transfer form basically
3/7/16, 13:35 - Cindy L: I asks for GPA and shit like that so I'm not sure how it's gonna be filled in
3/7/16, 13:35 - Cindy L: But whateva
3/7/16, 13:35 - Mom: as i said, i believe they wud accountfor the difference between diff countries uni reporting system
3/7/16, 13:35 - Mom: u don't hv to fill in
3/7/16, 13:36 - Cindy L: Yea but my advisor will ask me how to fill it in
3/7/16, 13:36 - Mom: just leave it blank
3/7/16, 13:37 - Mom: did ur advisor rlly ask this Q?
3/7/16, 13:37 - Mom: don't think she will
3/7/16, 13:37 - Cindy L: üòë
3/7/16, 13:40 - Mom: think abt it: even if u had ur final first yr exam report, u still can't convert it into GPA cuz they're two different computation method
3/7/16, 13:52 - Cindy L: Lol they have until 15 July to response says ucas
3/7/16, 13:57 - Mom: Áé©Âò¢Ôºü
3/7/16, 13:57 - Cindy L: Hahahaha
3/7/16, 13:57 - Cindy L: Now I need a good reason to send in an amendment
3/7/16, 13:58 - Mom: what amendment? ps?
3/7/16, 13:58 - Mom: as i said just send in additional supplements la
3/7/16, 13:59 - Cindy L: Yea
3/7/16, 13:59 - Cindy L: I'm emailing right now
3/7/16, 14:00 - Mom: kk
3/7/16, 14:02 - Cindy L: No I want to send in a new ps
3/7/16, 14:02 - Cindy L: Not additional supplement
3/7/16, 14:03 - Mom: u need to chk whether they accept it or not?
3/7/16, 14:04 - Cindy L: Yea
3/7/16, 14:05 - Cindy L: I can't ask if they would accept an amended supplement cuz that already suggests I didn't choose them first.
3/7/16, 14:06 - Cindy L: But additional  supplements sound like I'm gonna send in a batch of certificates
3/7/16, 14:07 - Mom: but do they have info from ucas that u have put applied to other courses/unis as well?
3/7/16, 14:07 - Cindy L: Yea
3/7/16, 14:07 - Cindy L: Well they're still gonna see statement one
3/7/16, 14:08 - Mom: and ur applying through extra, that means they knew u already decline of fail in other courses? right?
3/7/16, 14:08 - Cindy L: No I'm a late applicant
3/7/16, 14:08 - Cindy L: Cuz I didn't have five choices in the beginning
3/7/16, 14:09 - Mom: extra means late applicant?
3/7/16, 14:09 - Cindy L: I think extra would be worse tbh
3/7/16, 14:09 - Cindy L: No there's a difference
3/7/16, 14:09 - Cindy L: Late app just means u added the choice after Jan 15
3/7/16, 14:10 - Cindy L: Extra specifically means u failed 5 choices
3/7/16, 14:10 - Mom: to my understand, u can add 5 choices b4 jan15, and add one more as extra if u fail/decline all the previous 5 choices
3/7/16, 14:11 - Mom: so u used extra meaning that u've put bme second choice
3/7/16, 14:11 - Cindy L: No extra is a special service
3/7/16, 14:12 - Cindy L: By extra I specifically mean that I have failed my 5 choices and now I can add courses through extra
3/7/16, 14:12 - Mom: yea, i know it
3/7/16, 14:12 - Cindy L: If u didn't fail or use all 5 choices, ur app will be sent as a late app
3/7/16, 14:13 - Mom: so why don't u add 4 more at a time? instead of one by one?
3/7/16, 14:14 - Cindy L: Now I dunno before extra opened I couldn't do ao
3/7/16, 14:14 - Cindy L: So
3/7/16, 14:14 - Cindy L: Even though I wasn't an extra candidate
3/7/16, 14:14 - Mom: actually, u revised version of ps, i think, wud be pretty much as the first one, with only different in that u wudn't specify "u want to apply for design engrg"
3/7/16, 14:14 - Cindy L: Yea exactly my point
3/7/16, 14:15 - Cindy L: I would probably add a few lines about how much I love biomed
3/7/16, 14:15 - Cindy L: So should I bother
3/7/16, 14:15 - Mom: i think u need to ask ucas if u were treated as late applicant or extra?
3/7/16, 14:15 - Cindy L: I'm a late app
3/7/16, 14:16 - Mom: sure?
3/7/16, 14:16 - Cindy L: For sure
3/7/16, 14:16 - Mom: or when is space opened for extra?
3/7/16, 14:16 - Cindy L: Cuz when I added it said I could add four more choices
3/7/16, 14:17 - Mom: but u told me that u have to do it one by one?
3/7/16, 14:17 - Mom: i did ask why u didn't add ucl as well
3/7/16, 14:18 - Cindy L: Yea cuz there wasn't the button.
3/7/16, 14:18 - Cindy L: Nvm.
3/7/16, 14:18 - Mom: ? wasn't the button? what do u mean?
3/7/16, 14:18 - Mom: u can't add ucl or more choices?
3/7/16, 14:19 - Mom: nvm, just focus on imperial first
3/7/16, 14:19 - Cindy L: Like I couldn't click on the add choices button
3/7/16, 14:19 - Cindy L: So I assumed u had to add them one by one
3/7/16, 14:19 - Mom: sigh, u shud check with ucas ma
3/7/16, 14:20 - Mom: not assuming
3/7/16, 14:20 - Cindy L: I wonder when imperial will actually reply  though.
3/7/16, 14:21 - Mom: not put too much expectation on it
3/7/16, 14:21 - Cindy L: Yea yea
3/7/16, 14:21 - Cindy L: Yah? Yea
3/7/16, 14:21 - Mom: cuz even late applications r not guaranteed a reply time in ucas
3/7/16, 14:21 - Cindy L: So maybe I should just leave it
3/7/16, 14:22 - Mom: i think u just didn't make contingency plan, always stick to one way, no alternatives
3/7/16, 14:22 - Cindy L: What's a contingency plan
3/7/16, 14:23 - Mom: rmb ur case abt declining other unis, dual ba? and apply to design engrg only this time?
3/7/16, 14:23 - Cindy L: ....
3/7/16, 14:24 - Mom: like this time ucas app, i wud def add 2 or 3 choices if i rlly want to make a change no matter in like the course or not
3/7/16, 14:24 - Mom: u don't have to accept anything even if ur offered a place
3/7/16, 14:25 - Mom: but then u just stick to design engrg, and never thought of being declined right?
3/7/16, 14:25 - Cindy L: Riright
3/7/16, 14:25 - Cindy L: But my question here is should I bother amending my PS a bit
3/7/16, 14:25 - Mom: no matter how much u like design engrg, u still need a backup
3/7/16, 14:25 - Mom: not bother it
3/7/16, 14:26 - Cindy L: I should just leave it
3/7/16, 14:26 - Cindy L: Ok
3/7/16, 14:26 - Mom: cuz u don't know whether they accept it or not
3/7/16, 14:26 - Cindy L: Yea that's why I ask first
3/7/16, 14:27 - Mom: try to check with ucas whether u still can add more choices now
3/7/16, 14:27 - Cindy L: Yes I can
3/7/16, 14:27 - Cindy L: I can add choices but I'll be a late app
3/7/16, 14:28 - Mom: u can't do anything cuz the deadline is jan15 indeed
3/7/16, 14:28 - Cindy L: Ucl said I had to apply as late app even for transfer
3/7/16, 14:28 - Mom: once u pass the jan15 deadline, ur late applicant
3/7/16, 14:28 - Cindy L: Yes I know
3/7/16, 14:28 - Mom: so try ucl if u want to
3/7/16, 14:29 - Cindy L: But it doesn't make a diff
3/7/16, 14:29 - Cindy L: Cuz they just send the app to the uni
3/7/16, 14:29 - Cindy L: It just depends on the uni
3/7/16, 14:29 - Mom: do u have to pay for late charges?
3/7/16, 14:29 - Cindy L: No
3/7/16, 14:29 - Cindy L: I already paid for 5 choices
3/7/16, 14:29 - Cindy L: Ucl isn't even in extra anymore
3/7/16, 14:29 - Mom: then u shud use all 5 choices
3/7/16, 14:30 - Cindy L: Why what else should I apply for
3/7/16, 14:30 - Mom: physics? maths?
3/7/16, 14:30 - Cindy L: The only reason I'm still in interested in imperial is that they are in extra
3/7/16, 14:30 - Mom: why bother? u have pay for them right?
3/7/16, 14:31 - Cindy L: If I apply physics or math I might as well stay here..
3/7/16, 14:31 - Mom: so ru in extra or late applicant?
3/7/16, 14:31 - Cindy L: Late
3/7/16, 14:31 - Cindy L: I have three choices left
3/7/16, 14:31 - Mom: i thought u hate lse sooooo much
3/7/16, 14:31 - Cindy L: Not really I got used to it
3/7/16, 14:32 - Cindy L: But I still hv to sort out my illness
3/7/16, 14:32 - Cindy L: That's it.
3/7/16, 14:32 - Mom: üòë
3/7/16, 14:32 - Mom: kk
3/7/16, 14:32 - Cindy L: <Media omitted>
3/7/16, 14:34 - Mom: so why u can't add choices?
3/7/16, 14:34 - Mom: did u operate those buttons wrongly?
3/7/16, 14:34 - Cindy L: But now u mention it
3/7/16, 14:34 - Cindy L: I might as well use up the other choices
3/7/16, 14:35 - Mom: ha, u never thought of that b4?
3/7/16, 14:35 - Cindy L: Yea but there would be no point
3/7/16, 14:35 - Mom: nvm, do it now
3/7/16, 14:35 - Cindy L: Like buying lottery tickets
3/7/16, 14:35 - Cindy L: Except the tickets r free...
3/7/16, 14:36 - Mom: sort of
3/7/16, 14:37 - Mom: when u have to choose between unis/courses, ppl use to maximize the available choices b4 committing one
3/7/16, 14:37 - Mom: this is rational human being
3/7/16, 14:38 - Mom: like if u want buy a dress, ppl used to compare prices between shops b4 committing to buy from one shop
3/7/16, 14:39 - Cindy L: ....
3/7/16, 14:39 - Cindy L: Yea but the other options hv like 0.00001% probability of success so I negate them
3/7/16, 14:40 - Mom: nvm, just feel free to ur decision
3/7/16, 14:41 - Mom: hey, how abt this:
3/7/16, 14:42 - Cindy L: Ok I added one, two left
3/7/16, 14:42 - Cindy L: Might as well apply natural sciences
3/7/16, 14:42 - Cindy L: I might be able to flip over to biomed if I have chem credits
3/7/16, 14:43 - Mom: finish ur deg at lse first, and in the meantime take extra course on science subjects and start another med related deg after lse
3/7/16, 14:43 - Cindy L: Er yea that's what I hv been thinking abt these days
3/7/16, 14:44 - Cindy L: But I my CV will stat t having huge holes like that
3/7/16, 14:44 - Mom: if u don't rlly hates gov subjects, u still have a first degree with lse
3/7/16, 14:44 - Cindy L: Yea that's true
3/7/16, 14:44 - Mom: what hugh holes?
3/7/16, 14:45 - Cindy L: Huge holes cuz no research experience or internship
3/7/16, 14:45 - Cindy L: I mean staying at lse is kinda good since I can continue my lifestyle right now.
3/7/16, 14:45 - Mom: that wudn't be a prob cuz ur studying a soc sci deg
3/7/16, 14:46 - Cindy L: Er if ppl ask me what I did during the summer?
3/7/16, 14:46 - Mom: who wud expect one to have internship or research experience in different field
3/7/16, 14:46 - Mom: only if u can tell ppl that ur not doing nothing at that time
3/7/16, 14:47 - Cindy L: That's true.
3/7/16, 14:47 - Cindy L: OK so mean
3/7/16, 14:47 - Cindy L: Finish bsc now
3/7/16, 14:47 - Mom: like u said enrol for ucb summer course
3/7/16, 14:47 - Cindy L: Yah
3/7/16, 14:47 - Cindy L: Hmm
3/7/16, 14:47 - Cindy L: Isn't that risky
3/7/16, 14:47 - Mom: no, i'm just saying that this might be an alternative
3/7/16, 14:48 - Cindy L: Well yah
3/7/16, 14:48 - Mom: i have seen u being so "no soul" these days abt ur uni transfer
3/7/16, 14:48 - Cindy L: Lol
3/7/16, 14:48 - Cindy L: Because I'm unsure abt when to do it.
3/7/16, 14:49 - Cindy L: Also UC only accepts trf into third year
3/7/16, 14:50 - Cindy L: OK I just added another choice
3/7/16, 14:51 - Mom: ÂíÅÂï¶
3/7/16, 14:51 - Cindy L: What should I also apply for
3/7/16, 14:52 - Mom: continue with ur plan to apply for transfer to us uni and add more choices on ucas now
3/7/16, 14:52 - Cindy L: Well OK since I already wrote the essays
3/7/16, 14:53 - Mom: and ur not satisfied with the end outcome, just stay at lse and first ur deg first and at the same time enrol for ucb summer courses,
3/7/16, 14:53 - Mom: okay?
3/7/16, 14:53 - Cindy L: Er OK.
3/7/16, 14:53 - Mom: this is the best arrangement i can thought of
3/7/16, 14:53 - Cindy L: I wrote for stanford and nw
3/7/16, 14:54 - Mom: kk
3/7/16, 14:54 - Mom: no harm to apply
3/7/16, 14:54 - Cindy L: Wondering if I should bother with Cornell
3/7/16, 14:54 - Mom: only with a few thousand dollars
3/7/16, 14:55 - Cindy L: See applying for extra choice here really requires extra effort and money
3/7/16, 14:55 - Mom: which us unis did u write?
3/7/16, 14:55 - Cindy L: Stanford and nw
3/7/16, 14:55 - Mom: cornell la
3/7/16, 14:55 - Cindy L: Do it too?
3/7/16, 14:55 - Mom: cornell
3/7/16, 14:56 - Mom: corne;;
3/7/16, 14:56 - Cindy L: OK I can't go for engineering though
3/7/16, 14:56 - Mom: cornell's transfer acceptance is much higher than stanford, don't understand why u did for stanford but not cornell
3/7/16, 14:56 - Cindy L: True that
3/7/16, 14:57 - Cindy L: Cuz the narcolepsy centre for research is at stanford
3/7/16, 14:57 - Mom: open ur eyes and ur mind
3/7/16, 14:57 - Cindy L: But Stanford has no why Stanford essay üò≠
3/7/16, 14:58 - Mom: narco centre doesn't mean they can help u right?
3/7/16, 14:58 - Cindy L: Yea that's true
3/7/16, 14:58 - Mom: and it doesn't mean they wud agree with ur thinking right?
3/7/16, 14:59 - Mom: ur going there bc u want to get knowledge to help urself right?
3/7/16, 14:59 - Cindy L: That's true
3/7/16, 14:59 - Cindy L: So if I rank the US unis in order of importance
3/7/16, 15:00 - Mom: and as u said many research were done and publicized in not so well-known unis instead of   famous one right?
3/7/16, 15:01 - Cindy L: Yes that is true.
3/7/16, 15:01 - Cindy L: Should I even bother with us then
3/7/16, 15:01 - Mom: no, going ahead, why not give a try?
3/7/16, 15:02 - Cindy L: U see why this is taking so long, I always second guess. I'm bad at deciding things.
3/7/16, 15:02 - Mom: don't make decision b4 u were given an offer/choice, right?
3/7/16, 15:02 - Cindy L: Ok
3/7/16, 15:03 - Cindy L: I need to go brb
3/7/16, 15:03 - Mom: ur not bad at deciding things, just don't want the outcome of being disappointed!!!
3/7/16, 15:03 - Mom: i fully understand it
3/7/16, 15:03 - Mom: so why not try first to give urself offers and then u'll find ur confidence
3/7/16, 22:04 - Cindy L: Ok
3/7/16, 22:04 - Cindy L: Yes I got a 2:1 for my essay.
3/7/16, 23:08 - Mom: üëç
3/7/16, 23:08 - Cindy L: 2:1 is good enough
3/7/16, 23:21 - Mom: 2:1 is good ga la
3/7/16, 23:21 - Mom: pretty gd
3/7/16, 23:21 - Mom: see, i have told u that u can do better if u give more time on it
3/7/16, 23:25 - Cindy L: Yea i m trying to actually learn econ here.
3/7/16, 23:29 - Cindy L: I'm reading abt Lehman bros
3/7/16, 23:29 - Cindy L: Don't think finance is that great of a field to be in after 2008
3/7/16, 23:44 - Mom: Sigh
3/8/16, 00:16 - Cindy L: Lol
3/8/16, 00:17 - Cindy L: Be a professor, apparently the pay is really good according to the gv100 lecturer
3/8/16, 00:17 - Cindy L: Though to be fair he's also high holbornr Hall warden
3/8/16, 00:17 - Cindy L: That's basically like Christina's dad. üòë
3/8/16, 00:18 - Mom: Professor is a pretty gd job ah
3/8/16, 00:18 - Cindy L: Yea but u hv to get a phd
3/8/16, 00:18 - Cindy L: I think if I wanna do neuro, I'm already on the path
3/8/16, 00:19 - Cindy L: Unless I go become an MD
3/8/16, 00:19 - Mom: "on the path"?
3/8/16, 00:19 - Cindy L: The PhD path
3/8/16, 00:20 - Mom: Hahaha
3/8/16, 00:20 - Cindy L: Unless it's the other PhD parh
3/8/16, 00:21 - Mom: What other PhD path?
3/8/16, 00:21 - Cindy L: Pizza hut delivery
3/8/16, 00:22 - Cindy L: üòÇ
3/8/16, 00:22 - Mom: üòëüòë
3/8/16, 15:27 - Cindy L: Damn I just made myself Âá∫Ââç‰∏Ä‰∏Å and its soooo good.
3/8/16, 15:31 - Mom: well, thb Âá∫Ââç‰∏Ä‰∏Å rlly taste good
3/8/16, 15:32 - Cindy L: But amongst the london blandness, it was ten times as good üò≠
3/8/16, 15:33 - Mom: üòÇüòÇ
3/8/16, 16:44 - Cindy L: There is one more way...
3/8/16, 16:45 - Cindy L: Remember lse had a ucb exchange program.
3/8/16, 16:45 - Cindy L: Nvm i would need firsts foe that
3/8/16, 16:48 - Mom: kk
3/8/16, 16:48 - Mom: program requiremnt?
3/8/16, 16:48 - Cindy L: Yea i think
3/8/16, 16:49 - Cindy L: If i manage to be 60 credits i can transfee into junior year
3/8/16, 16:49 - Cindy L: To get
3/8/16, 16:49 - Cindy L: Thats a lot of credits...
3/8/16, 16:49 - Mom: have u read the program details?
3/8/16, 16:50 - Cindy L: Yea, my second year friend was gonna apply for it
3/8/16, 16:50 - Mom: she has 1st honour?
3/8/16, 16:50 - Cindy L: Yea
3/8/16, 16:51 - Cindy L: He's super good at math üòë
3/8/16, 16:51 - Mom: then u shud stick to him to ask for maths help
3/8/16, 16:51 - Cindy L: Lol
3/8/16, 16:52 - Cindy L: Well the math im doing is not that hard.
3/8/16, 16:52 - Cindy L: To be fair though, its not exactly a math course.
3/8/16, 16:52 - Mom: but u still didn't get a 1st for maths?
3/8/16, 16:53 - Cindy L: I havent even done the exam üòë
3/8/16, 16:53 - Mom: no exam yet?
3/8/16, 16:53 - Cindy L: No its in may?
3/8/16, 16:53 - Mom: or u just missed the exam?
3/8/16, 16:53 - Mom: ic
3/8/16, 16:54 - Cindy L: I jist did half an econ exam
3/8/16, 16:54 - Mom: kk
3/9/16, 13:11 - Cindy L: Ok
3/9/16, 13:11 - Cindy L: I just reviewed the exchange program again.
3/9/16, 13:11 - Cindy L: And clarified my objectives.
3/9/16, 13:12 - Cindy L: Fuck I need to do this all the time
3/9/16, 13:12 - Cindy L: I need a min of a high 2:2 for exchange
3/9/16, 13:12 - Cindy L: And my objective is to get into a neuroscience masters program
3/9/16, 13:13 - Cindy L: Which means I need chem courses in organic chem
3/9/16, 13:14 - Cindy L: So the exchange program looks really feasible since I go there for a year and those grades don't count towards my current degree
3/9/16, 13:15 - Cindy L: However
3/9/16, 13:15 - Cindy L: The catch is, there are only 10 places for the program üòû
3/9/16, 13:15 - Cindy L: Wtf man
3/9/16, 13:16 - Cindy L: I mean sure I can write all of this into a personal statement
3/9/16, 13:16 - Cindy L: But I'm not sure if lse will respect personal life goals
3/9/16, 13:17 - Cindy L: Plus I will need a reference again from my advisor... üòë and I just asked her to write one for me.
3/9/16, 13:17 - Cindy L: Just listing my thoughts which I hv managed to sort out thanks to the mess in my brain.
3/9/16, 13:33 - Mom: so what's the prob except the 10 places quota?
3/9/16, 14:13 - Cindy L: That's super low chance
3/9/16, 14:13 - Cindy L: And
3/9/16, 14:14 - Cindy L: My purpose is completely not related to lse .... Except to the motto
3/9/16, 14:14 - Cindy L: My skills r just I'm super good at presenting a case üò≠
3/9/16, 15:03 - Mom: errr....
3/9/16, 15:04 - Mom: tbh, there r only 10 places, extremely competitive!!
3/9/16, 15:04 - Mom: so i don't know why their requirement for a high 2:2 is pretty unreasonably low
3/9/16, 15:11 - Cindy L: Yea needa dig more info for that
3/9/16, 15:12 - Cindy L: And the lse chooses who gets to go not ucb
3/9/16, 15:13 - Mom: anyway, that's in the second yr, not now
3/9/16, 15:16 - Cindy L: Yea OK I checked with other second yrs apparently u get a different adviser
3/10/16, 11:27 - Cindy L: Mopps
3/10/16, 11:27 - Cindy L: I am wondering about what to do with transcript
3/10/16, 11:28 - Cindy L: And what to do with the other reference I need cuz Stanford requires two. üòë
3/10/16, 11:28 - Cindy L: I hv come up with plan which is to ask ms. Lau to upload the teacher ref and I already secured advisor rep so that should be ok
3/10/16, 11:29 - Cindy L: But I don't want to pay again
3/10/16, 11:29 - Cindy L: And I'll probably need to hv her mail my transcript too?
3/10/16, 11:31 - Cindy L: I was planning just mailing the transcript myself, I even manage to get the lse transcript
3/10/16, 11:31 - Cindy L: But I kinda need that ref....
3/10/16, 11:31 - Cindy L: Oh what ever I'll just ask her to upload the ref.
3/10/16, 12:08 - Mom: i think upload reference isn't a gd idea
3/10/16, 12:09 - Mom: can u ask ur kgv teacher to write one?
3/10/16, 12:09 - Mom: for those kgv transcripts, i can send it for u
3/10/16, 12:11 - Mom: cuz uploading ref doesn't bear a responsible teacher's name
3/10/16, 14:58 - Cindy L: Well the point is most of the college I'ma applying to only req one
3/10/16, 14:59 - Cindy L: Stanford is the only one which req two
3/10/16, 14:59 - Cindy L: And the KGV one is written under ms hughs name
3/10/16, 14:59 - Cindy L: It's good but not a prof
3/10/16, 14:59 - Cindy L: So I dun think it makes a load of different
3/10/16, 15:13 - Mom: if it's in ms hugh's name not mrs liu, it'll be better
3/10/16, 17:05 - Cindy L: Like the letter is in ms. Hughs name
3/10/16, 17:05 - Cindy L: Ms. Lau just uploads it as high schl counsellor
3/10/16, 17:05 - Cindy L: Last time berina did the same for me
3/10/16, 17:05 - Cindy L: Like I asked my teachers but they had a centralized reference collection system
3/10/16, 17:38 - Mom: k
3/11/16, 00:22 - Cindy L: Omg careers Dept charges $200 PER institution
3/11/16, 00:22 - Cindy L: Wtf
3/11/16, 00:22 - Mom: nvm la
3/11/16, 00:22 - Cindy L: This is just daylight robbery
3/11/16, 00:23 - Mom: ÈÉΩÈ¢ÑÂ∑¶

3/11/16, 00:25 - Cindy L: And 500 for urgent
3/11/16, 00:25 - Cindy L: They r seriously just running a business  here.
3/11/16, 00:25 - Mom: What 6 wks notice?
3/11/16, 00:25 - Cindy L: Like ask 6 weeks before
3/11/16, 00:25 - Cindy L: They might as well tell me to apply a year before
3/11/16, 00:25 - Mom: Oh
3/11/16, 00:26 - Cindy L: Wtf
3/11/16, 00:26 - Mom: But u don't need it immedi right?
3/11/16, 00:26 - Cindy L: Ye but not 6 weeks
3/11/16, 00:26 - Cindy L: That's cray cray
3/11/16, 00:26 - Mom: üòì
3/11/16, 00:27 - Cindy L: They already made their decision in 6 weeks
3/11/16, 00:27 - Cindy L: Is there a way to forge a reference
3/11/16, 00:28 - Cindy L: I was filling out the mid term form and I realised I could have just found four random people to sign it.
3/11/16, 00:30 - Mom: How to sign it? in person or electronically?
3/11/16, 00:30 - Cindy L: In person
3/11/16, 00:30 - Cindy L: I have to get my bloody instructors to sign it
3/11/16, 00:30 - Mom: And do they need those persons' details on the form?
3/11/16, 00:30 - Cindy L: No
3/11/16, 00:31 - Mom: So everyone can forge la
3/11/16, 00:31 - Cindy L: Ya
3/11/16, 00:31 - Cindy L: And the college report
3/11/16, 00:32 - Cindy L: I could forge that too tbh
3/11/16, 00:32 - Cindy L: Pretend to be registrar
3/11/16, 00:32 - Mom: No stamp needed for the college report?
3/11/16, 00:33 - Cindy L: No
3/11/16, 00:33 - Cindy L: It's a stupid form
3/11/16, 00:33 - Cindy L: I swear half of the common app is redundant
3/11/16, 00:33 - Mom: is it difficult to ask the registery to sign it?
3/11/16, 00:34 - Cindy L: I need to get my adviser to fill it in supposedly
3/11/16, 00:34 - Mom: so that shud be sign by ur advisor
3/11/16, 00:35 - Cindy L: But it can be filled in by registrar as well
3/11/16, 00:35 - Cindy L: Can't think of a way to fake a reference
3/11/16, 00:35 - Cindy L: But if I could I would be done by now
3/11/16, 00:36 - Mom: Why don't ask ur KGV teacher?
3/11/16, 00:36 - Cindy L: To write reference?
3/11/16, 00:36 - Mom: yea
3/11/16, 00:36 - Cindy L: Sigh that is a plan b I guess
3/11/16, 00:37 - Cindy L: But is it worth the trouble
3/11/16, 00:37 - Cindy L: For one college I have no chance of transfer anyways....
3/11/16, 00:37 - Mom: ur applying for famous uni, I don't recommend fake in this stage
3/11/16, 00:38 - Cindy L: Lol
3/11/16, 00:38 - Cindy L: Sigh such a nuisance
3/11/16, 00:39 - Cindy L: Fuck whatever
3/11/16, 00:39 - Cindy L: I still need to send my transcript
3/11/16, 00:39 - Cindy L: Oh and what's the password for sats
3/11/16, 00:39 - Cindy L: Cuz I need to order the reports
3/11/16, 00:40 - Mom: what if the uni want to ask more abt ur details?
3/11/16, 00:40 - Cindy L: For what?
3/11/16, 00:40 - Cindy L: I dunno? U tell them?
3/11/16, 00:41 - Cindy L: No the issue here is so small that I don't even know why I'm even concerned abt it
3/11/16, 00:41 - Mom: I'm on the bus way home, give u details when Bach there right?
3/11/16, 00:41 - Cindy L: Basically I already hv one ref from my advisor
3/11/16, 00:42 - Cindy L: And stanford is the annoying shit which requires two refs
3/11/16, 00:42 - Cindy L: So I'm like üòí already
3/11/16, 00:43 - Cindy L: And then I haven't finished writing a lot of the supplements for Stanford and my chances of getting in r lower than my chances of getting into the ucb program next yr tbh
3/11/16, 00:43 - Cindy L: Yea maybe I shouldn't bother.
3/11/16, 00:44 - Cindy L: And I can focus on finding out what happened to my imperial application and see if I can amend my ps
3/11/16, 00:44 - Cindy L: Hmmm...ü§î
3/11/16, 00:44 - Cindy L: Sounds like a good plan.
3/11/16, 00:44 - Mom: Sigh
3/11/16, 00:45 - Mom: have u finished the rest?
3/11/16, 00:46 - Cindy L: Pretty much
3/11/16, 00:46 - Cindy L: It's just cuz I discovered a lot of short ones in stanford one
3/11/16, 00:46 - Mom: I mean the application materials for other us unis?
3/11/16, 00:47 - Cindy L: Yes
3/11/16, 00:47 - Cindy L: I even hv a uni transcript
3/11/16, 00:47 - Mom: So ur prob now is that for standford only?
3/11/16, 00:47 - Cindy L: Yes
3/11/16, 00:48 - Cindy L: Lol and they don't even hv neuroscience as an undergrad major
3/11/16, 00:48 - Mom: So noe u need one more ref? and what else?
3/11/16, 00:49 - Cindy L: Ref and to finish the supplements
3/11/16, 00:49 - Mom: neuroscience isn't for graduated?
3/11/16, 00:49 - Cindy L: In America u can major in undergrad neuro
3/11/16, 00:49 - Mom: kk
3/11/16, 00:50 - Cindy L: My main plan/ hopes is to get into ucl natural sciences and try to sneak into biomedical sciences stream
3/11/16, 00:51 - Cindy L: Lol u can still become doctor after that.
3/11/16, 00:51 - Cindy L: So apparently BME is also the hottest engineering degree now, replacing chem eng
3/11/16, 00:51 - Cindy L: I guess cuz u can also go into med after that
3/11/16, 00:52 - Cindy L: Plus u get engineering and med skills.
3/11/16, 00:53 - Mom: But not everyone want to med related research
3/11/16, 00:53 - Cindy L: No I mean medicine
3/11/16, 00:53 - Cindy L: Like be a doctor
3/11/16, 00:53 - Cindy L: U can hv BME beng
3/11/16, 00:53 - Cindy L: And then do a mbbs
3/11/16, 00:54 - Cindy L: A lot of people on student room are doing that these days
3/11/16, 00:54 - Mom: Ttyl

3/11/16, 02:20 - Cindy L: I just had so and woke up I saw I had typed all of that and I also had a bad hallucination
3/11/16, 02:37 - Mom: here
3/11/16, 02:37 - Mom: what did u see?
3/11/16, 02:38 - Mom: u shud hv 5 or 6 copies of transcripts if i rmb right
3/11/16, 02:40 - Mom: i have been here all the time but it seems msg transmission at ur side has some prob
3/11/16, 02:41 - Mom: take a long long time to travel to ur side
3/11/16, 02:54 - Mom: switch on the cam on ur laptop so that i can see u when doing whatsapp
3/11/16, 03:04 - Mom: ru ok now?
3/11/16, 03:09 - Cindy L: Yea
3/11/16, 03:09 - Cindy L: I tell u tmr
3/11/16, 03:09 - Cindy L: My phone is low on battety
3/11/16, 03:09 - Mom: get to bed and sleep first
3/11/16, 03:09 - Mom: even though u can't sleep, just get to bed and rest
3/11/16, 07:34 - Cindy L: It is now morning
3/11/16, 07:35 - Cindy L: I didn't see anything
3/11/16, 07:35 - Cindy L: I don't see stuff
3/11/16, 07:36 - Cindy L: I think I fell asleep with my keyboard still on
And the auto typing typed that creepy msg
3/11/16, 07:36 - Cindy L: As u can see the number and letters r really close to each other
3/11/16, 07:36 - Cindy L: Anyways
3/11/16, 07:37 - Cindy L: I had a bowl of Ben and Jerry's last night before bed
3/11/16, 07:37 - Cindy L: Big mistake
3/11/16, 07:37 - Cindy L: Seriously not good
3/11/16, 07:38 - Cindy L: I think sugar maybe the cause of all this.
3/11/16, 07:39 - Cindy L: Oh the jaw thing happenes again, it felt like someone was trying to rip my lower jaw out
3/11/16, 07:40 - Cindy L: Did I mention I was in sleep paralysis?
3/11/16, 07:40 - Mom: physically feeling or in a dream? abt ur jaet
3/11/16, 07:40 - Mom: Jaw
3/11/16, 07:40 - Cindy L: Dunno
3/11/16, 07:40 - Cindy L: It hurts though
3/11/16, 07:40 - Mom: Last night?
3/11/16, 07:40 - Cindy L: Yea
3/11/16, 07:41 - Cindy L: As in it hurt when I felt it
3/11/16, 07:41 - Mom: sp?
3/11/16, 07:41 - Cindy L: But after I wake up the sensation is gobe
3/11/16, 07:41 - Cindy L: Gone
3/11/16, 07:41 - Cindy L: Yes, def sp
3/11/16, 07:41 - Mom: still feel jaw pain?
3/11/16, 07:41 - Cindy L: I was conscious
3/11/16, 07:41 - Cindy L: No
See abovr
3/11/16, 07:42 - Mom: the time u typed that weird msg between we were discussing ur trf thingy is relatively short?
3/11/16, 07:43 - Cindy L: Really?
3/11/16, 07:43 - Mom: u felt asleep?
3/11/16, 07:43 - Cindy L: Yea I'm sure I fell asleep
3/11/16, 07:43 - Cindy L: Cuz I hv no memory of doing it
3/11/16, 07:43 - Mom: I can chk ur msg time, just a few min
3/11/16, 07:44 - Cindy L: By the time I post it, I was ready in the kitchen btw
3/11/16, 07:44 - Cindy L: So everything happened within 20 mins
3/11/16, 07:44 - Cindy L: üòß
3/11/16, 07:44 - Mom: u were in the kitchen when talking with me?
3/11/16, 07:45 - Mom: yea, rlly short time
3/11/16, 07:45 - Mom: and if u noticed the weird msg showed some words
3/11/16, 07:46 - Cindy L: Last msg before the weird one was at 0153 and the next time I post a coherent msg was 0214
3/11/16, 07:46 - Cindy L: Before the weird one I was in bed, and then after the SP episode happened I was in the kitchen
3/11/16, 07:47 - Cindy L: Yea I mean the msg had a lot of regret
3/11/16, 07:47 - Cindy L: But I think that's cuz of the autotype
3/11/16, 07:48 - Cindy L: Cuz I've used that word before and if u look on the keyboard the letters which spell regret are close to each other also the numbers are sort of in that spot
3/11/16, 07:48 - Cindy L: So I'll assume that was coincidence
3/11/16, 07:48 - Cindy L: But it was scary as fuc at 2 am
3/11/16, 07:49 - Cindy L: Anyways so duration seems to be quite a lot shorter than I previously thought
3/11/16, 07:51 - Cindy L: OK
3/11/16, 07:51 - Cindy L: Hi take that back
3/11/16, 07:51 - Cindy L: I just tried to randomly type out the same msg
3/11/16, 07:51 - Cindy L: U hv to do it pretty deliberately
3/11/16, 07:51 - Cindy L: üò±
3/11/16, 07:51 - Cindy L: This is scaring me
3/11/16, 07:52 - Mom: so at the time the weird msg was autotyped, u were on the bed?
3/11/16, 07:52 - Cindy L: Yes
3/11/16, 07:52 - Cindy L: But I take back the autotype hypothesis
3/11/16, 07:52 - Mom: don't think of the possibility
3/11/16, 07:52 - Cindy L: Each word is spelt out perfectly
3/11/16, 07:53 - Mom: err....
3/11/16, 07:53 - Cindy L: I just tried the autotype, and u can't use that to type the same word over and over
3/11/16, 07:53 - Cindy L: So I had to have spelt out each of regrets on purpose
3/11/16, 07:54 - Cindy L: Plus u can see there are other words like this and have
3/11/16, 07:54 - Cindy L: Those r also spelt perfectly
3/11/16, 07:54 - Mom: errr .....
3/11/16, 07:54 - Mom: ru scare noe?
3/11/16, 07:54 - Mom: noe
3/11/16, 07:55 - Cindy L: Now
3/11/16, 07:55 - Mom: now
3/11/16, 07:55 - Cindy L: No it's morning
3/11/16, 07:55 - Cindy L: But it's a creepy msg
3/11/16, 07:55 - Cindy L: Omg
3/11/16, 07:55 - Mom: Can u tell me ur bad hallucination?
3/11/16, 07:56 - Cindy L: Yea was going on to that
3/11/16, 07:56 - Mom: forget that msg first
3/11/16, 07:56 - Cindy L: OK I felt like a small pair of hands
3/11/16, 07:56 - Cindy L: Like from a child
3/11/16, 07:56 - Cindy L: But I couldn't see the kid
3/11/16, 07:57 - Cindy L: So I thought she was invisible
3/11/16, 07:57 - Cindy L: She kept grabbing onto both of my hands
3/11/16, 07:57 - Cindy L: I think this is when SP started
3/11/16, 07:57 - Mom: did she hurt u?
3/11/16, 07:58 - Cindy L: Not yet
3/11/16, 07:58 - Cindy L: In my head I sort of felt some form of communication
3/11/16, 07:58 - Cindy L: Fuzzy here, not sure what happened
3/11/16, 07:58 - Cindy L: And then at some point
3/11/16, 07:58 - Cindy L: I felt someone pulling my big toes
3/11/16, 07:59 - Cindy L: And then the kid was sort of lying on top of me
3/11/16, 08:00 - Cindy L: And I was cradling it's head in my arms
3/11/16, 08:00 - Cindy L: If u get what I mean
3/11/16, 08:01 - Cindy L: And then it started rubbing its face against my hands
3/11/16, 08:02 - Cindy L: And after that it tried to put my fingers in its mouth
This is when I assumed it was trying to eat my fingers so I panicked.
3/11/16, 08:02 - Cindy L: And I tried to move but I couldnt
3/11/16, 08:02 - Cindy L: But I was only partially paralysed
3/11/16, 08:03 - Cindy L: So I was sort of like writhing around trying to get away
3/11/16, 08:03 - Cindy L: And I tried yelling for people, but they couldn't hear me
3/11/16, 08:04 - Mom: Just talk, I'm walking in the street, rather difficult to reply, but I'm here all the time
3/11/16, 08:04 - Cindy L: I kicked the wall next to me to try to get attention of my neighbour andd I thought I heard a response but that maybe part of the hallucination
3/11/16, 08:05 - Cindy L: So I was doing all of that while trying to get that thing off me and try to prevent my fingers from being eaten.
3/11/16, 08:06 - Cindy L: And I was trying very hard to move and get out of the room all the time.
3/11/16, 08:06 - Cindy L: When the fingers sensation stopped, I felt pain in my jaw
3/11/16, 08:07 - Cindy L: It was like I couldn't close my mouth properly
3/11/16, 08:07 - Cindy L: And it hurt like hell
3/11/16, 08:08 - Cindy L: And the sensation was exactly the same as the original ones two years ago
3/11/16, 08:09 - Cindy L: Then suddenly, somehow I managed to overcome some sort of threshold
3/11/16, 08:09 - Cindy L: A physical threshold
3/11/16, 08:09 - Cindy L: I sort of snapped out of it and could move freely again
3/11/16, 08:10 - Cindy L: And I ran out of the room
3/11/16, 08:10 - Cindy L: And saw what I had typed and was terrified
3/11/16, 08:11 - Cindy L: Cuz of the weird msg and I met a demon child
3/11/16, 08:11 - Cindy L: Btw
3/11/16, 08:11 - Cindy L: I didn't see anything through the whole thing.
3/11/16, 08:11 - Cindy L: Everything was just felt
3/11/16, 08:11 - Cindy L: The lights were also all fully on
3/11/16, 08:21 - Mom: Did I tell ur flatmates abt this?
3/11/16, 08:22 - Cindy L: No
3/11/16, 08:22 - Cindy L: The ones who see things weren't here
3/11/16, 08:22 - Cindy L: And I'm not going to tell the ones who don't
3/11/16, 08:23 - Cindy L: Did I mention this is all the ice cream's fault?
3/11/16, 08:23 - Mom: he can see things in high holborn residence?
3/11/16, 08:25 - Cindy L: Chronic SP guy
3/11/16, 08:25 - Cindy L: He actually told me not to eat sweet stuff before bed
3/11/16, 08:25 - Cindy L: Well now we see what happens.
3/11/16, 08:26 - Mom: stay calm first and to forget what u felt/sense
3/11/16, 08:27 - Mom: otherwise that will cause u more anxious
3/11/16, 08:39 - Mom: i'm back home now, can type faster
3/11/16, 08:39 - Cindy L: Ok
3/11/16, 08:39 - Cindy L: I'm going out
3/11/16, 08:39 - Mom: then talk later, stay calm and relax
3/11/16, 08:39 - Cindy L: But I'm ok
3/11/16, 08:40 - Mom: talk a walk and deep breath cuz i read paper that said bad indoor air do cause hallucinations
3/11/16, 08:41 - Cindy L: It's the b&j
3/11/16, 08:42 - Cindy L: Thats the cause
3/11/16, 08:42 - Mom: kk
3/11/16, 08:42 - Cindy L: I don't think hh is haunted yet
3/11/16, 08:42 - Cindy L: Why does sugar worsen hallucination that's the question
3/11/16, 08:42 - Mom: is ur jaw ok now?
3/11/16, 08:43 - Cindy L: Yes I'm not sp-ing
3/11/16, 08:43 - Mom: has it been pulled out?
3/11/16, 08:43 - Cindy L: No nothing happened to it.
3/11/16, 08:43 - Cindy L: Its just the sensation
3/11/16, 08:43 - Mom: so sugar trigger dermentia?
3/11/16, 08:43 - Cindy L: Find of
3/11/16, 08:43 - Mom: see
3/11/16, 08:43 - Cindy L: Kind of
3/11/16, 08:43 - Cindy L: Yea it was like dementia
3/11/16, 08:44 - Mom: so b4 u got ur sleep disorder, u ate so much sweet when we lived in Tsing Lung Lau rmb?
3/11/16, 08:44 - Cindy L: Yes
3/11/16, 08:44 - Mom: will that be the cause?
3/11/16, 08:44 - Cindy L: I'm surprised i don't hv type 2
3/11/16, 08:44 - Cindy L: Not sure
3/11/16, 08:45 - Cindy L: But sugar exacerbates the hallucinations
3/11/16, 08:45 - Mom: so poor if sugar is the trigger!!!!!
3/11/16, 08:45 - Cindy L: It's probably not just one trigger.
3/11/16, 08:47 - Mom: how often do u have those hallucination these days?
3/11/16, 08:48 - Cindy L: Only once
3/11/16, 08:48 - Cindy L: Cuz its the ice cream
3/11/16, 08:48 - Mom: the one last night?
3/11/16, 08:49 - Mom: then u have to quit ur lovely ice cream
3/11/16, 09:04 - Cindy L: I only ate it once

3/11/16, 13:57 - Mom: U don't sleep well last night
3/11/16, 16:09 - Cindy L: Should I let registry know that I'm transferring?
3/11/16, 16:18 - Cindy L: I seriously know why my senpai only applied for nw
3/11/16, 16:18 - Cindy L: And I'm amazed they accepted her.
3/11/16, 16:18 - Cindy L: It's a nightmareeeee üò±
3/11/16, 16:30 - Cindy L: Wtf
3/11/16, 16:30 - Cindy L: Ucb's neuroscience institution
3/11/16, 16:30 - Cindy L: Is like a dream
3/11/16, 16:30 - Cindy L: But whatever
3/11/16, 16:30 - Cindy L: I'll apply next year
3/11/16, 16:30 - Cindy L: Hahahha
3/11/16, 16:35 - Mom: why nightmare?
3/11/16, 16:36 - Cindy L: Cuz forms
3/11/16, 16:36 - Cindy L: And I literally hv no qualifications except for my ibd and sats
3/11/16, 16:36 - Cindy L: Which aren't even that great
3/11/16, 16:36 - Mom: u mean the forms r so complicated that hinder ppl apply?
3/11/16, 16:37 - Cindy L: Yes
3/11/16, 16:37 - Cindy L: Yesss exactly
3/11/16, 16:37 - Cindy L: Why can't the whole thing be simpler.
3/11/16, 16:37 - Cindy L: Fucking hell
3/11/16, 16:37 - Mom: why ur amazed ur senpai got accepted by nw?
3/11/16, 16:38 - Cindy L: Dude I'm having doubts this app even stands a chance. I know they admit mainly based on gpa
3/11/16, 16:38 - Cindy L: My essay is good, that's about it
3/11/16, 16:39 - Cindy L: I think I may hv more chance of the ucb thing if I literally went to the Dept and begged.
3/11/16, 16:40 - Mom: but what do u think u were accepted by ucsd b4?
3/11/16, 16:40 - Mom: u just had ib predicted grades and sat as well
3/11/16, 16:41 - Cindy L: Cuz UCSD is UCSD üòë
3/11/16, 16:41 - Cindy L: Actually I dunno
3/11/16, 16:41 - Cindy L: Whatever I didn't know it was like top ten engineering school back then
3/11/16, 16:41 - Cindy L: And I applied with predicted 45
3/11/16, 16:43 - Mom: so ur applying for transfer now?
3/11/16, 16:43 - Mom: not applyig?
3/11/16, 16:43 - Mom: applying?
3/11/16, 16:44 - Cindy L: Yea I already asked everybody ofc
3/11/16, 16:44 - Cindy L: Whatever
3/11/16, 16:44 - Cindy L: Rosanne originally applied for nw
3/11/16, 16:45 - Mom: she got rejected?
3/11/16, 16:46 - Mom: well, at this stage u have already prepared everything for the application, why not give a try? even u don't have much expectation, right?
3/11/16, 16:47 - Cindy L: Yes but it's still stressful
3/11/16, 16:48 - Mom: take it easy la
3/11/16, 16:49 - Cindy L: I dunno why but this is bringing me a lot of stress
3/11/16, 16:50 - Cindy L: I feel like I've stirred up a lot of shit and still gonna just go back to lse next yr
3/11/16, 16:50 - Mom: just do it like meeting a deadline for an assignment and then leave it
3/11/16, 16:50 - Mom: ur good at meeting deadline right/
3/11/16, 16:54 - Mom: no u don't have to tell ur registry that ur asking for transfer to usa
3/11/16, 16:59 - Mom: u can't think like that
3/11/16, 17:00 - Mom: ur making a change so u need to do more to accomplish ur goal, that's it
3/11/16, 17:01 - Mom: everybody go through the same process if she want to do something different from the existing one, right?
3/11/16, 17:01 - Mom: not that a big deal
3/11/16, 17:02 - Cindy L: My advisor just forced me to ask so too bad
3/11/16, 17:02 - Mom: ask what?
3/11/16, 17:03 - Mom: ur depressed bc u just have no support from kgv and ur existing uni
3/11/16, 17:05 - Mom: btw, u have almost completed ur application materials, why give up?
3/11/16, 17:05 - Mom: i'm afraid u wud regret again if u stop at this stage?
3/11/16, 17:06 - Cindy L: Fuck no
3/11/16, 17:07 - Cindy L: By stress I literally mean I'm getting a heart burn
3/11/16, 17:07 - Cindy L: Serious chemical imbalance
3/11/16, 17:06 - Mom: ru feeling frustrated or depressed now?
3/11/16, 17:08 - Cindy L: No  it feels like the opposite of an adrenaline surge
3/11/16, 17:08 - Cindy L: Like heart burn
3/11/16, 17:09 - Mom: if so, then u shudn't think like that
3/11/16, 17:09 - Mom: u sound not wanting to do the transfer thingy
3/11/16, 17:09 - Cindy L: Cuz I've lost the inhibitory signals so neurotransmitter production fluctuates
3/11/16, 17:10 - Cindy L: I'm not kidding, I feel like I hv heart burn
3/11/16, 17:10 - Cindy L: I'm really sensitive to anxiety
3/11/16, 17:11 - Cindy L: That I get actual physical reactions
3/11/16, 17:11 - Mom: u have indigestion prob?
3/11/16, 17:11 - Cindy L: Dunno
3/11/16, 17:11 - Cindy L: I hv a friend who gets iba
3/11/16, 17:11 - Cindy L: Ibs
3/11/16, 17:12 - Mom: so how do u feel now other than heartburn?
3/11/16, 17:30 - Cindy L: Oh no i think I do hv IBS
3/11/16, 17:33 - Cindy L: Anxiety feels horrible
3/11/16, 17:42 - Mom: u feel anxious bc u care abt the matter, so just finish ur job and not to think of the possible outcome
3/11/16, 17:42 - Mom: if u hesitate, u'll have much more stress and anxiety
3/11/16, 19:14 - Cindy L: Shit I just laughed and basically went into an altered state
3/11/16, 19:15 - Cindy L: And then during paralysis there was a point where I was blind
3/11/16, 19:15 - Cindy L: I saw black but still heard everything around me
3/11/16, 19:17 - Cindy L: But it wasn't exactly black but there were rainbow curved lines like the rainbow shiny shapes u see in crude oil
3/11/16, 19:17 - Cindy L: But I was blink temporary
3/11/16, 19:17 - Cindy L: Blinnd
3/12/16, 00:19 - Mom: Were u wearing contact at that time? any pain on ur eyes?

3/12/16, 10:08 - Mom: can't agree
3/12/16, 10:08 - Cindy L: too bad
3/12/16, 10:08 - Mom: and u have more hallucinations there
3/12/16, 10:09 - Cindy L: it's just the ice cream
3/12/16, 10:09 - Cindy L: and i always had hallucinations
3/12/16, 10:09 - Mom: also more weird things happened
3/12/16, 10:09 - Cindy L: i just didn't know how to describe them
3/12/16, 10:09 - Cindy L: i always had those things, i just didn't know how to describe the
3/12/16, 10:09 - Cindy L: m
3/12/16, 10:09 - Mom: how's ur eyes now? painful?
3/12/16, 10:09 - Cindy L: why painful?
3/12/16, 10:09 - Cindy L: nothing happened to them
3/12/16, 10:10 - Mom: don't put too much eye drops on them cuz eye drops wud increase the eye pressure
3/12/16, 10:10 - Cindy L: i haven't really used the eye drops
3/12/16, 10:11 - Cindy L: and i mostly wear glasses cuz i'm working
3/12/16, 10:12 - Cindy L: paypal blocked my bloody debit card.
3/12/16, 10:11 - Mom: u said u were in altered state yesterday when u were having catapletic attack, ur not conscious?
3/12/16, 10:12 - Mom: give ur eyes 5 - 10 mins break for 1/2 or an hour's reading on laptop
3/12/16, 10:13 - Mom: why?
3/12/16, 10:13 - Cindy L: no i was
3/12/16, 10:13 - Cindy L: but not exactly
3/12/16, 10:13 - Cindy L: lemme think
3/12/16, 10:13 - Cindy L: i was listening to the agm
3/12/16, 10:13 - Cindy L: to the speakers
3/12/16, 10:13 - Cindy L: and then said something funny in a speech
3/12/16, 10:14 - Cindy L: and i had cataplexy a few times
3/12/16, 10:14 - Cindy L: and the more times i had cataplexy
3/12/16, 10:15 - Cindy L: i sort of slowly had this pounding pressure in my head
3/12/16, 10:15 - Cindy L: like a gradual build up
3/12/16, 10:15 - Cindy L: until there was a point when i open my eyes after cataplexy everything black
3/12/16, 10:16 - Cindy L: everything was black
3/12/16, 10:16 - Cindy L: and i saw faint rainbow shapes
3/12/16, 10:16 - Cindy L: i thought they were like cevs
3/12/16, 10:16 - Cindy L: except my eyes were def open
3/12/16, 10:16 - Cindy L: and i could hear and understand what they were saying.
3/12/16, 10:17 - Cindy L: and then after that i'm not sure what happened
3/12/16, 10:17 - Cindy L: and i woke up and regained my visions
3/12/16, 10:17 - Cindy L: vision
3/12/16, 10:17 - Cindy L: not woke up
3/12/16, 10:17 - Cindy L: more liek
3/12/16, 10:17 - Mom: how long from the time ur not sure what happened to ur wake up?
3/12/16, 10:17 - Cindy L: return to normal
3/12/16, 10:18 - Cindy L: very short
3/12/16, 10:18 - Cindy L: they were doing q and A
3/12/16, 10:18 - Cindy L: and they hadn't even finished
3/12/16, 10:18 - Mom: so u were having this incident when attending lse's agm talk right?
3/12/16, 10:19 - Cindy L: i was in a society which was having their agm
3/12/16, 10:19 - Cindy L: to be fair, it was the second agm i sat through that day
3/12/16, 10:20 - Mom: and what is "cevs"?
3/12/16, 10:20 - Cindy L: closed eye visions
3/12/16, 10:20 - Cindy L: visuals
3/12/16, 10:24 - Cindy L: OK either something wrong with my WhatsApp or ur phone
3/12/16, 10:24 - Cindy L: I realise msg are sent very slowly
3/12/16, 10:24 - Mom: exactly
3/12/16, 10:25 - Mom: i think it's ur phone
3/12/16, 10:26 - Mom: was ur head pain or whatever at the time u said u were having increased pounding pressure?
3/12/16, 10:27 - Cindy L: no
3/12/16, 10:27 - Cindy L: there's no actual pain
3/12/16, 10:27 - Cindy L: it just feels uncomfortable
3/12/16, 10:28 - Cindy L: don't know how to describe it cuz i don't remembe
3/12/16, 10:28 - Cindy L: remember
3/12/16, 10:28 - Mom: like not having enough fresh air?
3/12/16, 10:28 - Cindy L: its like trying to remember a dream
3/12/16, 10:28 - Cindy L: when i try to recall the episodes
3/12/16, 10:28 - Cindy L: that's why i call it an altered state
3/12/16, 10:29 - Cindy L: as in an altered state of consciouness
3/12/16, 10:30 - Mom: so perhaps u hv gone into rem state at the time?
3/12/16, 10:30 - Mom: ok, take enough rest both physically and mentally
3/12/16, 10:31 - Mom: and have u rec'd the parcel from DHL, it's gingseng extract again
3/12/16, 10:33 - Mom: ur kgv's transcripts r here in hk, do i need to do anything for u?
3/12/16, 10:33 - Cindy L: again?
3/12/16, 10:33 - Cindy L: yes
3/12/16, 10:33 - Mom: there're 5 copies here
3/12/16, 10:33 - Cindy L: u need to send one to northwestern
3/12/16, 10:33 - Cindy L: one to cornel
3/12/16, 10:33 - Cindy L: cornell
3/12/16, 10:33 - Cindy L: and maybe nyu
3/12/16, 10:33 - Mom: ok
3/12/16, 10:34 - Cindy L: i'll give u the address later
3/12/16, 10:34 - Mom: okay
3/12/16, 10:34 - Cindy L: and then i may go back to pestering imperial
3/12/16, 10:34 - Cindy L: cuz bme is good.
3/12/16, 10:34 - Cindy L: though
3/12/16, 10:34 - Cindy L: i think ucl's biomedical facilities are better cuz they invest more in that area
3/12/16, 10:35 - Cindy L: but their website is shit
3/12/16, 10:35 - Mom: but u said those ppl at studentroom said bme is shit?
3/12/16, 10:41 - Cindy L: if u don't want to go into biotech dev it is
3/12/16, 10:41 - Cindy L: like if u are undecided
3/12/16, 10:42 - Cindy L: and decide to choose bme cuz it covers a bit of everything
3/12/16, 10:48 - Cindy L: anyways back to the brain.
3/12/16, 10:48 - Mom: ok
3/12/16, 10:48 - Cindy L: i've been reading about the amygdala
3/12/16, 10:48 - Mom: then?
3/12/16, 10:48 - Cindy L: everything is related to it.
3/12/16, 10:49 - Mom: what everything?
3/12/16, 10:49 - Mom: won't be
3/12/16, 10:50 - Cindy L: no as in all my symptoms are.
3/12/16, 10:50 - Cindy L: controlled by some part of the amydala
3/12/16, 10:50 - Cindy L: mainly the lateral amygdala
3/12/16, 10:50 - Mom: u think so?
3/12/16, 10:51 - Cindy L: but it doesn't seem like teh amygdala is malfunctioning
3/12/16, 10:51 - Mom: no, it has no relationship with muscle atonia
3/12/16, 10:52 - Cindy L: sleep and circadian rhythm is also relevant to the amygdala
3/12/16, 10:52 - Cindy L: not to mention
3/12/16, 10:52 - Cindy L: dreams
3/12/16, 10:52 - Cindy L: rem
3/12/16, 10:52 - Cindy L: hallucinations
3/12/16, 10:52 - Cindy L: arousal
3/12/16, 10:52 - Cindy L: addiction
3/12/16, 10:52 - Cindy L: esp regarding the reward system
3/12/16, 10:53 - Cindy L: also one interesting thing is that
3/12/16, 10:54 - Cindy L: and the hypothalamus
3/12/16, 10:55 - Cindy L: laughter and rage are relevant to the hypothalamus
3/12/16, 10:55 - Cindy L: i think it is more likely there is something wrong with hypothalamus than the amygdala
3/12/16, 10:59 - Cindy L: not to mention that the hypothalamus originally developed with the retina cells
3/12/16, 10:59 - Cindy L: when during fetal formation
3/12/16, 10:59 - Cindy L: so i guess that probably explains all the eye problems i'm having
3/12/16, 11:00 - Cindy L: and rem cycles are regulated by serotonin levels.
3/12/16, 11:01 - Cindy L: but my understanding of neurotransmitters is that they produce excitatory or inhibitory signals
3/12/16, 11:02 - Cindy L: and homeostasis is pretty maintained in the brain by achieve balance in these ssignals
3/12/16, 11:03 - Cindy L: which means the only way to fix things is really to fix the original problem, usually by replacing the missing chemicals which originally produced the signals
3/12/16, 11:05 - Cindy L: hopefully in the future in the form of a pill
3/12/16, 11:05 - Mom: but we were unable to test ur neurotransmitters, i doubt drs can do that?
3/12/16, 11:05 - Cindy L: lololol
3/12/16, 11:05 - Cindy L: that's why i need to find ppl to invest in my bioreactor
3/12/16, 11:07 - Cindy L: not to mention the added difficulty of having multiple receptors for each chemical which have different purposes
3/12/16, 11:08 - Cindy L: and also the location of where the chem is can also alter its purpose
3/12/16, 11:08 - Cindy L: and it fluctuates over time
3/12/16, 11:08 - Cindy L: hormone therapy looks pretty grim right now.
3/12/16, 11:10 - Mom: it's rlly difficult to manage hormone cuz we don't know whether it's the chemicals themselves or the receptors or other enzymes acting on those chemicals having prob?
3/12/16, 11:11 - Mom: can i ask if ur spine is still painful?
3/12/16, 11:23 - Cindy L: no

3/12/16, 11:29 - Mom: it's ridiculous sugar damage ur brain?
3/12/16, 11:29 - Mom: how's it? good?
3/12/16, 11:29 - Cindy L: no sugar elevates ur levels of dopamine
3/12/16, 11:29 - Cindy L: i feel like its related to dopamine and addiciton
3/12/16, 11:30 - Cindy L: so far we know a lot of sugar worsens symptoms
3/12/16, 11:30 - Cindy L: so i need to cut back on carbs again
3/12/16, 11:30 - Cindy L: but when i was ketone, i was so freaking thired

3/12/16, 11:31 - Mom: why tired?
3/12/16, 11:31 - Cindy L: that
3/12/16, 11:31 - Cindy L: true too
3/12/16, 11:31 - Cindy L: simple sugars should not be a problem
3/12/16, 11:32 - Cindy L: what do you mean by why tired?
3/12/16, 11:32 - Cindy L: i never get enough sleep, ofc im tired.
3/12/16, 11:33 - Cindy L: i did start having soba a lot this year for lunch
3/12/16, 11:33 - Mom: u said when u go ketone, ur freaking tired, do u mean go ketone makes u tired?
3/12/16, 11:34 - Cindy L: no by ketone i was referring to ketone diet
3/12/16, 11:34 - Cindy L: only proteins
3/12/16, 11:35 - Mom: did u eat lots of sugar or meats?
3/12/16, 11:35 - Cindy L: don't sleep as well
3/12/16, 11:35 - Mom: i know

3/12/16, 11:35 - Mom: so go ketone helps sleep quality?
3/12/16, 11:36 - Cindy L: no
3/12/16, 11:36 - Cindy L: makes u sleep worse
3/12/16, 11:36 - Mom: or having soba noodle only helps sleep?
3/12/16, 11:36 - Cindy L: or like no improve in gen
3/12/16, 11:36 - Cindy L: yeah i sleep better this term
3/12/16, 11:36 - Mom: soba noodle is good?
3/12/16, 11:36 - Mom: simple sugar?
3/12/16, 11:37 - Mom: carb and starch?
3/12/16, 11:37 - Cindy L: yeah hence hallucinations
3/12/16, 11:37 - Mom: i know sugar wud induce hallucinations or make it worse
3/12/16, 11:37 - Cindy L: or more like rem after each meal
3/12/16, 11:38 - Cindy L: i just had soba and remmed
3/12/16, 11:38 - Mom: by rem, u mean having rem dreams?
3/12/16, 11:38 - Cindy L: yes i mean rem
3/12/16, 11:39 - Cindy L: as in rem sleep + dreaming
3/12/16, 11:39 - Cindy L: i usually have porridge and i also rem
3/12/16, 11:39 - Cindy L: in the morning for breakfast
3/12/16, 11:39 - Cindy L: and then lunch is soba and crabsticks
3/12/16, 11:39 - Cindy L: which i also rem
3/12/16, 11:39 - Cindy L: to
3/12/16, 11:40 - Cindy L: dinner depends
3/12/16, 11:40 - Mom: so rem mostly in the daytime?
3/12/16, 11:40 - Cindy L: if i don't rem, i feel really really really tired.
3/12/16, 11:40 - Mom: so rem is kind of rest for u
3/12/16, 11:53 - Cindy L: yes
3/12/16, 11:53 - Cindy L: like for example
3/12/16, 11:53 - Cindy L: on days where i have 9 am class
3/12/16, 11:53 - Cindy L: i wake up at around 7
3/12/16, 11:53 - Cindy L: have breakfast
3/12/16, 11:54 - Cindy L: but no time to sleep third block after that
3/12/16, 11:54 - Cindy L: i get really really really tired from 10 onwards
3/12/16, 11:55 - Mom: so can u function at that moment?
3/12/16, 11:55 - Cindy L: yea sort of, keep falling asleep though
3/12/16, 11:55 - Cindy L: its like if u haven't slept for 3 days
3/12/16, 11:56 - Cindy L: that feeling
3/12/16, 11:56 - Mom: ic
3/12/16, 11:56 - Cindy L: so on thursdays
3/12/16, 11:57 - Cindy L: i skip lse100 and lectures alternatingly
3/12/16, 11:57 - Cindy L: cuz i just can't manage more than 2 hrs
3/12/16, 11:57 - Mom: c
3/12/16, 11:57 - Cindy L: peace
3/12/16, 11:58 - Cindy L: after breakfast is a bit different
3/12/16, 11:58 - Cindy L: chances of sleeping after a proper meal is high
3/12/16, 11:58 - Cindy L: i either sleep voluntarily or slip into rem myself and see hallucinations and shit
3/12/16, 11:59 - Cindy L: sorry not see
3/12/16, 11:59 - Cindy L: get hallucinatinos
3/12/16, 11:59 - Cindy L: if i skip lunch or have a small snack
3/12/16, 11:59 - Cindy L: can keep going until late in the afternoon
3/12/16, 12:00 - Cindy L: when i get very very very tired
3/12/16, 12:00 - Cindy L: and its like i haven't slept for 3 days again
3/12/16, 12:01 - Mom: it seems ur battery run out so quickly
3/12/16, 12:01 - Cindy L: yeah
3/12/16, 12:01 - Cindy L: like that
3/12/16, 12:01 - Cindy L: like my phone right now
3/12/16, 12:05 - Cindy L: i was also thinking that yesterday, when i was momentarily blind
3/12/16, 12:05 - Cindy L: that was when my brain disconnected my eyes.
3/12/16, 12:06 - Cindy L: i mean they must do that when you sleep, so u can see the visuals produced in the brain instead
3/12/16, 12:06 - Mom: why disconnected?
3/12/16, 12:06 - Cindy L: well if cataplexy is related to rem
3/12/16, 12:06 - Cindy L: and u dream during rem
3/12/16, 12:07 - Cindy L: so at some point when u enter rem
3/12/16, 12:07 - Cindy L: the brain must shut down the optical function to replace with dream visuals
3/12/16, 12:07 - Mom: so ur brain is preparing ur physical to go into rem sleep/
3/12/16, 12:07 - Cindy L: yes
3/12/16, 12:09 - Mom: so conclusion is there's nothing wrong with ur nerves but just the process of going into rem and somehow u suddenly can open ur eyes, right?
3/12/16, 12:09 - Cindy L: yep
3/12/16, 12:09 - Mom: but when ur having muscles atonia, can u control ur eyes?
3/12/16, 12:09 - Cindy L: in other words i was going into rem but i retained motor function and consciousness at that point
3/12/16, 12:10 - Cindy L: i remember i was stick trying to regulate breathing to try and stop cataplexy
3/12/16, 12:10 - Mom: yea
3/12/16, 12:11 - Cindy L: but if i managed to focus on breathing, i must hv regained eye control already
3/12/16, 12:12 - Mom: an interesting Q: why by controlling ur breath, u can control cataplexy?
3/12/16, 12:14 - Cindy L: yes thats also an interesting point
3/12/16, 12:16 - Cindy L: cuz when u breathe, u're actually using ur muscles
3/12/16, 12:16 - Cindy L: so i suppose if u manage to regain control of diaphragm and the torso muscles
3/12/16, 12:16 - Cindy L: then logically, ur other motor function should also have come back
3/12/16, 12:17 - Cindy L: bbut the thing here is that the breathing muscles and limbs are different kinds of muscles
3/12/16, 12:17 - Cindy L: so i 'm not sure
3/12/16, 12:17 - Cindy L: trying to find a note
3/12/16, 12:19 - Cindy L: ok i found it
3/12/16, 12:20 - Cindy L: the basal ganglia controls gross motor through the striatum
3/12/16, 12:20 - Cindy L: including limb movements
3/12/16, 16:27 - Cindy L: Yo
3/12/16, 16:27 - Cindy L: Mopps

3/12/16, 16:29 - Cindy L: Michael mosely
3/12/16, 16:29 - Mom: has narco?
3/12/16, 16:29 - Cindy L: No Guess what his first degree is

3/12/16, 16:31 - Cindy L: But remember we were wondering what kinda background he had
3/12/16, 16:31 - Cindy L: Yes
3/12/16, 16:31 - Cindy L: Oxford is the only one who offers ppe
3/12/16, 16:31 - Cindy L: Back then
3/12/16, 16:31 - Mom: but he is a doctor if i rmb right
3/12/16, 16:32 - Cindy L: Yes he went to study psychiatry after oxford

3/12/16, 16:32 - Mom: deg

3/12/16, 16:33 - Cindy L: Anyways
3/12/16, 16:33 - Mom: hmmm
3/12/16, 16:33 - Cindy L: And then after that he changed his mind and went to work for bbc
3/12/16, 16:33 - Cindy L: Lol what a life
3/12/16, 16:34 - Mom: oh u can send an email to him and ask
3/12/16, 16:34 - Cindy L: Hahaha
3/12/16, 16:34 - Cindy L: That's a good idea
3/12/16, 16:34 - Cindy L: Though if BBC recruits me I rather go there
3/12/16, 16:35 - Mom: but if he's a dr, he has to go through those practical training
3/12/16, 16:35 - Mom: sure la
3/12/16, 16:35 - Cindy L: I dunno if hes a dr.
3/12/16, 16:35 - Mom: he said in the tv if i rmb right

3/12/16, 16:41 - Mom: see if they allow u do it first!!
3/12/16, 16:41 - Mom: if this way works, it wud be perfect la

3/12/16, 16:46 - Cindy L: Don't trust the media kids
3/12/16, 16:46 - Cindy L: That's true too
3/12/16, 16:46 - Mom: ofc la
3/12/16, 16:46 - Cindy L: Don't trust appearances
3/12/16, 16:46 - Mom: sure la
3/12/16, 16:46 - Cindy L: But aesthetics is my specialty, I live off visuals
3/12/16, 16:47 - Cindy L: üò•
3/12/16, 16:47 - Cindy L: My visual senses are  dominant
3/12/16, 16:48 - Mom: in fact, every thing has changed alot since ur yr12' so its difficult to look back
3/12/16, 16:48 - Cindy L: True that
3/12/16, 16:49 - Mom: but i realise that ur the type for an engr
3/12/16, 16:49 - Cindy L: Yes
3/12/16, 16:49 - Cindy L: BME is the best engineering degree nowadays u know
3/12/16, 16:50 - Cindy L: chem engineersüòè
3/12/16, 16:50 - Mom: u know, to be an engr, u hv to be creative, attentive to details anf pratically hands-on
3/12/16, 16:51 - Mom: but chem engrg can do pharmacy work
3/12/16, 16:51 - Cindy L: I guess
3/12/16, 16:52 - Cindy L: It's not the highest pay anymore that's what I meant
3/12/16, 16:53 - Mom: btw, the highest pay chem engrg has to do with offshore oil drilling work
3/12/16, 16:53 - Cindy L: Oh lse is fourth for economics in the world this year
3/12/16, 16:53 - Mom: which is very tough
3/12/16, 16:53 - Mom: 2016?
3/12/16, 16:54 - Cindy L: Yea I guess, I would imagine drug design to be pretty high pay too
3/12/16, 16:54 - Cindy L: Yes
3/12/16, 16:54 - Cindy L: 2016
3/12/16, 16:54 - Cindy L: We r first in Europe and 4th in the world

3/12/16, 16:54 - Cindy L: It
3/12/16, 16:55 - Cindy L: But the actual teaching is so shit in econ dept
3/12/16, 16:56 - Mom: perhaps just for the first yr
3/12/16, 16:56 - Cindy L: Probs
3/12/16, 16:56 - Cindy L: And when u ask people what's the best thing abt lse
3/12/16, 16:56 - Cindy L: They always say societies
3/12/16, 16:57 - Mom: what societies?
3/12/16, 16:57 - Mom: student soc?

3/12/16, 16:59 - Mom: good thing
3/12/16, 16:59 - Cindy L: Really.
3/12/16, 16:59 - Cindy L: All the seniors I know spend as much time on society work as the time they spend on class work
3/12/16, 16:59 - Cindy L: Lol
3/12/16, 17:00 - Mom: cuz societies work r another form of polishing ur cv
3/12/16, 17:00 - Mom: on top of ur deg
3/12/16, 17:01 - Cindy L: That's true but do u really want anime society on ur CV

3/12/16, 17:03 - Cindy L: Fine fair enough
3/12/16, 17:04 - Cindy L: I have to say, I'm not doing that bad of a job here
3/12/16, 17:04 - Cindy L: I know most of the sociable Asian people already
3/12/16, 17:05 - Mom: the attitude, organisation skills, connection ...... r the key points behind doing soc work, not the subject of the society, got it
3/12/16, 17:05 - Cindy L: Kk

3/12/16, 20:01 - Cindy L: I just pass out and then wake up, realise I fell asleep
3/13/16, 02:21 - Mom: bc ur soooooo tired
3/13/16, 02:24 - Mom: just keep track of the change, i think ur brain has the ability to rewire
3/13/16, 02:24 - Mom: it all depends on ur will
3/13/16, 02:25 - Mom: iis it better to sleep without dreams or with dreams?
3/13/16, 04:00 - Cindy L: I dunno cuz if I sleep without dreams it's like I just lost an hr or two in my life.
3/13/16, 04:02 - Cindy L: But if I dream I sort of gain a sense of time
3/13/16, 04:02 - Cindy L: I guess that evens out?
3/13/16, 04:02 - Cindy L: But I can my eyes get a bit swollen if I sleep too much
3/13/16, 04:04 - Cindy L: I'm actually not sure abt that question cuz I feel like shit after both.
3/13/16, 09:28 - Mom: hi

3/13/16, 13:00 - Mom: hi, just forward the DHL's reply to ur gmail a/c
3/13/16, 13:01 - Mom: it seems that the british custom is going to collect VAT on that parcel, which is 20% of it, i think
3/13/16, 13:01 - Mom: total VAT is 13pp, i think
3/13/16, 13:02 - Mom: cuz goods therein cost 65pp
3/13/16, 13:03 - Mom: http://uk.iherb.com/Ilhwa-Pure-Concentrated-Ginseng-Tea-3-5-oz-100-g/47286
3/13/16, 13:20 - Cindy L: Wtf
3/13/16, 13:20 - Cindy L: R u serious
3/13/16, 13:20 - Cindy L: They sell ginseng here too u know
3/13/16, 13:21 - Cindy L: I don't get it, that's the same one u bought last time
3/13/16, 13:21 - Cindy L: Why only collect vat this time round??
3/13/16, 13:22 - Mom: last time, i bought from amazon uk
3/13/16, 13:22 - Mom: this time, i bought from iherb usa, which is much cheaper than in uk
3/13/16, 13:26 - Cindy L: Right but including vat it's the same now right?
3/13/16, 13:27 - Mom: still cheaper
3/13/16, 13:27 - Cindy L: I'll email dhl uk
3/13/16, 13:27 - Mom: thx
3/13/16, 13:28 - Cindy L: But they sell ginseng tea at the Korean shop, I dunno how much it costs though
3/13/16, 13:28 - Mom: i know for imported costing more than 34 pounds, customs wud levy extra VAT in uk
3/13/16, 13:28 - Mom: go check it, but i wonder it wudn't be cheaper in uk
3/13/16, 13:29 - Mom: us online website used to be the most cheapest one
3/13/16, 14:04 - Cindy L: Oh
3/13/16, 14:04 - Cindy L: Ok whatever I submitted an enquiry already
3/13/16, 14:06 - Mom: kk
3/13/16, 20:10 - Cindy L: Wait I just realised I dont hv med insurance
3/13/16, 20:11 - Cindy L: Which maybe a problem in the US.....
3/13/16, 21:58 - Cindy L: NOOOOOOOOO
3/13/16, 21:58 - Cindy L: I cracked my screen üò¢
3/13/16, 22:02 - Mom: mobile phone?
3/13/16, 22:04 - Mom: if go to us, buy med insurance
3/14/16, 00:43 - Cindy L: Yes my phone screen
3/14/16, 00:44 - Cindy L: So I can't reveal my narcoleptic experiences
3/14/16, 01:02 - Mom: i know in us, insurance company wud accept pre-existing condition with additional premium, not sure whether expense or not
3/14/16, 01:03 - Mom: even now, i also have bought student insurance for ur study in uk, which also included medical insurance
3/14/16, 01:04 - Mom: go buy a new phone la
3/14/16, 01:10 - Mom: or ask the mobile co to replace the cracked screen at a lower cost
3/14/16, 01:12 - Mom: abt the insurance, even if the insur co don't accept pre-existing condition, u still can buy med insurance only with exclusion of narco disorders, that means any claims in relation to narco disorders will not be entertained
3/14/16, 02:05 - Cindy L: Oh I see
3/14/16, 14:24 - Cindy L: Mopps
3/14/16, 14:24 - Cindy L: Can u help me send the Sat reports?
3/14/16, 14:24 - Cindy L: Cuz u have the card
3/14/16, 14:24 - Cindy L: For payment
3/14/16, 14:25 - Cindy L: Just send Sat I and sat Ii scores to NW and cornell
3/14/16, 14:26 - Cindy L: Im not sure if u get to choose, but choose the best ones if they allow score choice.
3/14/16, 14:26 - Cindy L: Ty
3/14/16, 14:28 - Cindy L: Omg just looked at faqs, this is the last yr they will accept old versions of the satüò±
3/14/16, 14:46 - Mom: u do it la
3/14/16, 14:46 - Mom: just pay by ur hsbc credit card
3/14/16, 14:47 - Mom: why data transmission took so long time?
3/14/16, 14:47 - Mom: i'm by the desk all the time but i just rec'd ur msg
3/14/16, 14:51 - Mom: last yr? that means u have to sit for the test again?
3/14/16, 14:52 - Cindy L: Nvm
3/14/16, 14:52 - Cindy L: Cuz my phone is suddenly lagging like shit
3/14/16, 14:52 - Cindy L: Samsung must hv programmed all phones to lag like shit when s7 comes out
3/14/16, 14:53 - Mom: so, is there any prob with ur sat scores?
3/14/16, 14:54 - Cindy L: No I just meant that this is the last yr I can use those scores to apply transfer
3/14/16, 14:54 - Cindy L: anyhow
3/14/16, 14:54 - Cindy L: So problem
3/14/16, 14:54 - Cindy L: Transcripts need to be sent by the issuing institution
3/14/16, 14:54 - Mom: kk
3/14/16, 14:54 - Mom: so hv to get back to kgv?
3/14/16, 14:55 - Cindy L: For Cornell they say u hv to
3/14/16, 14:55 - Cindy L: I am starting to understand why Janet only applied for nw
3/14/16, 14:56 - Mom: does Cornell need electronic or printout transcript?
3/14/16, 14:56 - Cindy L: Official transcript
3/14/16, 14:56 - Cindy L: Sent by mail
3/14/16, 14:57 - Mom: but u have that official transcript
3/14/16, 14:57 - Cindy L: By issuing institution
3/14/16, 14:57 - Cindy L: I mean they must hv put that there for a reason.
3/14/16, 14:58 - Mom: ofc, in order to avoid fraud
3/14/16, 14:58 - Cindy L: So what do we do now
3/14/16, 14:59 - Mom: how much will kgv charge for transcript, do u rmb?
3/14/16, 14:59 - Cindy L: 500 per institution
3/14/16, 14:59 - Cindy L: Forget abt it then
3/14/16, 15:00 - Cindy L: I'll just apply northwestern
3/14/16, 15:00 - Cindy L: And then ucb exchange program next year
3/14/16, 15:00 - Cindy L: I think I hv a chance at that.
3/14/16, 15:00 - Mom: 500 for upload of reference right?
3/14/16, 15:00 - Cindy L: 500 for an order
3/14/16, 15:01 - Mom: kk
3/14/16, 15:01 - Cindy L: ? Kk to which msg?
3/14/16, 15:03 - Mom: the one b4 kk
3/14/16, 15:04 - Cindy L: Rite.
3/14/16, 15:04 - Cindy L: Don't tell me u're gonna pay 500
3/14/16, 15:05 - Mom: i'm thinking if we can just send the transcript ourselves
3/14/16, 15:05 - Cindy L: Tbh there isn't much of a point
3/14/16, 15:05 - Cindy L: Cuz I barely have a reference either and they accept based on gpa
3/14/16, 15:06 - Cindy L: I was just wondering if I should just wait and apply for the ucb thing next year
3/14/16, 15:06 - Mom: u don't hv reference? why?
3/14/16, 15:06 - Cindy L: I mean I do but my academic advisor said she couldn't really put much except for what courses I'm doing right now
3/14/16, 15:07 - Mom: this is the reason why i told u to ask ur previous teachers
3/14/16, 15:07 - Mom: to write u reference
3/14/16, 15:08 - Cindy L: Yes but even janet said it's better to hv Prof to write ref.
3/14/16, 15:08 - Mom: where comes a Prof?
3/14/16, 15:08 - Cindy L: My advisor is a prof
3/14/16, 15:08 - Mom: do the Prof know u well for writing a ref?
3/14/16, 15:09 - Mom: oic
3/14/16, 15:09 - Mom: is janet from kgv as well?
3/14/16, 15:09 - Cindy L: Ys she's the girl who transferred
3/14/16, 15:09 - Cindy L: And she only applied nw
3/14/16, 15:10 - Cindy L: So now we know why
3/14/16, 15:10 - Mom: i know but she is one yr senior?
3/14/16, 15:10 - Cindy L: Yes
3/14/16, 15:10 - Mom: ic
3/14/16, 15:11 - Cindy L: I know someone who applied for the ucb exchange and I think he got it
3/14/16, 15:11 - Cindy L: He just had visa issues that he couldn't go
3/14/16, 15:11 - Mom: but u never know if u can get it next yr right?
3/14/16, 15:12 - Mom: what if?
3/14/16, 15:13 - Cindy L: That's true. But tbh my app is so crappy for transfer that my chances of getting it is like close to none.
3/14/16, 15:13 - Cindy L: And there's still nyu
3/14/16, 15:14 - Cindy L: Esp transfer to cornell, top tier unis.
3/14/16, 15:14 - Mom: i don't agree
3/14/16, 15:14 - Cindy L: üòë
3/14/16, 15:15 - Mom: as long as u have put ur effort in preparing all the application materials, u shud always try
3/14/16, 15:15 - Cindy L: No first year grades, crappy reference, not spectacular Sat score and even my essays do not use my biggest leverage
3/14/16, 15:15 - Cindy L: Cuz they don't hv a neuro program.
3/14/16, 15:16 - Cindy L: That's really the main point here
3/14/16, 15:16 - Cindy L: They don't hv a freaking neuro program
3/14/16, 15:16 - Cindy L: Cornell's research is more focused on cancer
3/14/16, 15:16 - Cindy L: So I was actually having doubts....
3/14/16, 15:16 - Mom: if they don't have neuro, then u shud have put time in compiling those application la
3/14/16, 15:17 - Cindy L: I just wrote abt immunology
3/14/16, 15:17 - Cindy L: I tried.
3/14/16, 15:18 - Cindy L: I'm just saying not sure if that's a great idea....
3/14/16, 15:18 - Cindy L: And my network at lse is actually quite good not sure if I wanna give it up for that.
3/14/16, 15:19 - Mom: my thinking is this:
3/14/16, 15:19 - Mom: 1) u have done all the app materials, go ahead
3/14/16, 15:19 - Mom: 2) think abt whether go or not only if they accept ur transfer
3/14/16, 15:20 - Mom: unless, ur now so sure that u don't want a change
3/14/16, 15:20 - Cindy L: Not really for first point, I just completed nw
3/14/16, 15:20 - Cindy L: It's not like applying is free...
3/14/16, 15:21 - Mom: those app fee is trivial
3/14/16, 15:21 - Cindy L: But the effort and time running around chasing ppl for documents is not.
3/14/16, 15:21 - Cindy L: Whatever
3/14/16, 15:22 - Cindy L: I still haven't finished the Cornell app fuck
3/14/16, 15:22 - Cindy L: And I need to go to lecture.
3/14/16, 15:22 - Mom: so ur now satisfied with the lse deg, then that's fine
3/14/16, 15:23 - Mom: what i'm worried is that u wud regret for not doing the app for transfer, not giving urself a chance
3/14/16, 15:23 - Cindy L: Yah I know, that's why I'm asking u
3/14/16, 15:23 - Mom: like what u've regret for not choosing ucsd
3/14/16, 15:23 - Cindy L: OK the ucsd thing is dumb
3/14/16, 15:24 - Mom: my opinion is as above
3/14/16, 15:24 - Cindy L: Ideally I want to transfer to ucb or UCSD but UC apps is like completely different  schedule
3/14/16, 15:24 - Mom: don't bother those trivial app fee
3/14/16, 15:24 - Cindy L: Like even if I got into Cornell I would then go to ucb
3/14/16, 15:25 - Mom: whether go or not go to Cornell is another story
3/14/16, 15:25 - Mom: u didn't even send the app, how come go or not?
3/14/16, 15:25 - Cindy L: I'm sending the NW app
3/14/16, 15:25 - Cindy L: That's good
3/14/16, 15:25 - Cindy L: I can still send an NYU app
3/14/16, 15:25 - Cindy L: That's good
3/14/16, 15:26 - Mom: is NYU rlly good at neurosci?
3/14/16, 15:26 - Cindy L: No but Columbia is
3/14/16, 15:26 - Cindy L: NYU is good at econ
3/14/16, 15:27 - Mom: u don't even want to go to Cornell for their cancer research, and now u want to pick NYU?
3/14/16, 15:27 - Mom: is this reasonable?
3/14/16, 15:27 - Cindy L: No think abt the 3-2 combined program
3/14/16, 15:27 - Cindy L: I just need to do 2 years at NYU and then go to Columbia
3/14/16, 15:28 - Cindy L: That's would be the advantage of nyu
3/14/16, 15:28 - Mom: why?
3/14/16, 15:28 - Cindy L: To get an engineering degree
3/14/16, 15:28 - Mom: they're sister unis?
3/14/16, 15:28 - Mom: any agreement between them?
3/14/16, 15:29 - Cindy L: Well u need to apply for that thing but it's not like I'm applying from a lower tier lib art college
3/14/16, 15:29 - Cindy L: Apparently if u meet requirements, u're pretty much guaranteed entry
3/14/16, 15:29 - Cindy L: But I agree there is risk.
3/14/16, 15:30 - Mom: "applying from a lower tier lib art college" do u mean Columbia doesn't like lse
3/14/16, 15:31 - Cindy L: No I mean as in literally lower tier lib art colleges.
3/14/16, 15:31 - Cindy L: That program is targeted towards them
3/14/16, 15:31 - Cindy L: I don't think lse is related to this matter.
3/14/16, 15:32 - Cindy L: Generally my biggest problem is that I don't hv actual grades at the moment.
3/14/16, 15:32 - Mom: what abt nw? they accept no first yr grade transfer?
3/14/16, 15:33 - Cindy L: The thing is Kings had mid terms
3/14/16, 15:33 - Cindy L: So when Janet applied she probably had those to show
3/14/16, 15:33 - Mom: so kcl has mid term report?
3/14/16, 15:34 - Cindy L: As in they had exams in beginning of Lent term
3/14/16, 15:34 - Mom: but u said there's a temporary transcript from lse?
3/14/16, 15:34 - Cindy L: Yea I asked for it and saw it, it's really only a list of courses u are enrolled in
3/14/16, 15:34 - Cindy L: Cuz there is no predicted grades or the like
3/14/16, 15:35 - Mom: what abt ur course work grades?
3/14/16, 15:35 - Cindy L: That's still not official cuz they're all waiting to be moderated.
3/14/16, 15:36 - Cindy L: So there was like nothing on my transcript except for a list of all the courses I'm enrolled in
3/14/16, 15:36 - Cindy L: This is why I'm saying my chances of getting any offers is significantly lower than Janet.
3/14/16, 15:37 - Cindy L: I could very well apply for spring transfer
3/14/16, 15:37 - Cindy L: Which by then I would have a proper transcript and I could apply to be research assistant and get a better reference
3/14/16, 15:38 - Cindy L: But then I'm not sure abt spring admission rates.
3/14/16, 15:38 - Mom: but rmb that for spring transfer, u already have started ur second yr, will those uni still accept transfer? this is a prob?
3/14/16, 15:38 - Cindy L: No because they run per semester
3/14/16, 15:38 - Cindy L: The system is completely different
3/14/16, 15:38 - Cindy L: It's like enrolling for summer courses each season.
3/14/16, 15:39 - Cindy L: U can literally study at three different unis to get ur degree and it wouldn't mattry
3/14/16, 15:39 - Mom: Columbia says very clearly that they won't consider stud already started their 2nd yr studies, rmb?
3/14/16, 15:39 - Cindy L: Yes that is because Columbia is ivy
3/14/16, 15:39 - Cindy L: If u look at ivy then they have their own rules cuz they're private
3/14/16, 15:40 - Cindy L: But with ucb and michigan
3/14/16, 15:40 - Mom: no u can't enroll in 3 different unis at the same time
3/14/16, 15:40 - Cindy L: Yes I know
3/14/16, 15:40 - Cindy L: I meant if u did first yr at one, second yr at another
3/14/16, 15:40 - Cindy L: Etc.
3/14/16, 15:41 - Mom: who the hell wud do that?
3/14/16, 15:41 - Cindy L: Public unis accept transfer purely on GPA basis
3/14/16, 15:41 - Cindy L: To kind of hop to a good uni
3/14/16, 15:41 - Cindy L: Like u could start at an average lib art and then hop ur way to a uc
3/14/16, 15:41 - Cindy L: That's very possible
3/14/16, 15:42 - Cindy L: Anyways that's the US system.
3/14/16, 15:42 - Cindy L: That's why they provide such good service cuz they want to retain their students.
3/14/16, 15:43 - Mom: all i know is that they used to do 2+2 for a first deg cuz it wud be cheaper to do the first 2 yrs at community college and then 2 at a better uni
3/14/16, 15:43 - Cindy L: I mean if UK was more transfer friendly, then everyone would hv transferred away in lse.
3/14/16, 15:43 - Cindy L: Look all u need to get an MIT degree is to stay there for two years I remember
3/14/16, 15:44 - Cindy L: Yea first option is true too
3/14/16, 15:44 - Cindy L: But community college wor
3/14/16, 15:44 - Cindy L: Lib art would be much better reputation
3/14/16, 15:45 - Cindy L: Anyways in light of all this, should I still go for cornell
3/14/16, 15:45 - Mom: i gave my advice already
3/14/16, 15:45 - Cindy L: Given that if I don't get nw, i will try for ucs and Michigan for spring
3/14/16, 15:46 - Mom: it's all own choice now, i can't force u to do anything u don't want to right?
3/14/16, 15:46 - Cindy L: That's true
3/14/16, 15:46 - Mom: but then at that time, u don't need another Prof to write reference?
3/14/16, 15:46 - Mom: what if u need two references?
3/14/16, 15:47 - Mom: and how abt ur sat scores?
3/14/16, 15:47 - Cindy L: Still usable this year
3/14/16, 15:47 - Cindy L: I already panicked abt the reference thing.
3/14/16, 15:47 - Cindy L: Michigan ref is optional lol
3/14/16, 15:47 - Mom: i mean if u apply for spring trf, sat still usable?
3/14/16, 15:47 - Cindy L: Yes
3/14/16, 15:48 - Mom: ok
3/14/16, 15:48 - Cindy L: Next year I hv a different adviser
3/14/16, 15:48 - Mom: see, there's always a prob for the reference right?
3/14/16, 15:48 - Cindy L: I already asked around.
3/14/16, 15:48 - Cindy L: Yes exactly
3/14/16, 15:48 - Cindy L: Which means if I want a good ref
3/14/16, 15:48 - Cindy L: I need to apply to be a research assistant
3/14/16, 15:48 - Mom: exactly, she's new so she know nothing abt u, how can she write a good ref?
3/14/16, 15:49 - Cindy L: Well the new one will probably just report first yr grades and attendance the such
3/14/16, 15:49 - Cindy L: I think UC only needed one ref
3/14/16, 15:50 - Cindy L: To my knowledge
3/14/16, 15:50 - Mom: at 2nd yr, courses work must be heavier than 1st yr, do RA, can u cope with so many things?
3/14/16, 15:50 - Mom: still need transfer?

3/14/16, 15:52 - Cindy L: Or do summer course and get those class instructor to write reference
3/14/16, 15:52 - Cindy L: That could also be a plan
3/14/16, 15:52 - Cindy L: Cuz that's what Christina did for risd
3/14/16, 15:52 - Mom: good
3/14/16, 15:52 - Cindy L: That's would actually be better if I was applying for ucs
3/14/16, 15:52 - Mom: üëç

3/14/16, 18:25 - Mom: üò°üò°üò°üò°
3/14/16, 20:51 - Cindy L: Yea üò†
3/14/16, 22:52 - Cindy L: Yo so
3/14/16, 22:52 - Cindy L: Apparently the UK has tariffs for us imports
3/14/16, 22:53 - Cindy L: And it's just the us
3/14/16, 22:53 - Cindy L: Lol
3/14/16, 22:53 - Cindy L: So it's ridiculously expensive to ship anything from the us
3/14/16, 22:59 - Cindy L: Here's the northwestern address btw
3/14/16, 22:59 - Cindy L: <Media omitted>
3/14/16, 23:03 - Mom: No, that's not for US prodi only, that's import tariff for everywhere from the world
3/14/16, 23:04 - Mom: Even u ship from hk exceeding :¬£34 still have to pay import VAT
3/14/16, 23:05 - Mom: Do I hv to write for any reference number on the envelope?
3/14/16, 23:12 - Mom: the ridiculous thing is DHL charges me 10 pound disbursement fee, which is not reasonable!!!!
3/14/16, 23:31 - Cindy L: Yes I know
3/14/16, 23:31 - Cindy L: Oh wells nothing I can do abt it
3/14/16, 23:32 - Cindy L: I think you will need common app id
3/14/16, 23:32 - Cindy L: I was wondering if I should just email a scanned copy since transfers said that they accept electronic copies too
3/14/16, 23:33 - Cindy L: I mean it has the school chop so should be OK I think
3/14/16, 23:33 - Mom: just that first, if they require printout they'll ask again?
3/14/16, 23:33 - Cindy L: Yea
3/14/16, 23:33 - Mom: or u have to sort out the Q?
3/14/16, 23:34 - Mom: do u have scanned copy in ur file?

3/14/16, 23:37 - Cindy L: Kk, but I'm pretty sure I hv a copy
3/14/16, 23:37 - Cindy L: Can u still cancel the dhl payment?
3/14/16, 23:38 - Cindy L: As HSBC to cancel it or something?
3/14/16, 23:38 - Mom: what cancel payment? i don't think u can at this point?
3/14/16, 23:38 - Cindy L: I mean if u have to pay 10pp, might as well order from Amazon
3/14/16, 23:39 - Cindy L: I've ordered stuff from the US before and with Amazon I didn't need to pay any extra fees
3/14/16, 23:39 - Mom: then i'll have to return the prod and ask for a refund which is so troublesome
3/14/16, 23:39 - Mom: nvm, just don't bother it
3/14/16, 23:39 - Cindy L: Yea ok
3/14/16, 23:39 - Mom: how much is that?

3/14/16, 23:44 - Mom: ttyl
3/14/16, 23:48 - Cindy L: Kk
3/15/16, 00:13 - Mom: but if I import into UK, u'll hv yo pay VAT again
3/15/16, 00:13 - Mom: *u

3/15/16, 02:24 - Cindy L: I was just thinking

3/15/16, 00:21 - Mom: Ru buying google nexus 5x?
3/15/16, 00:21 - Mom: How much is it in UK?

3/15/16, 02:27 - Emos: cheapcheap
3/15/16, 02:27 - Emos: nexus phones r so discounted
3/15/16, 02:31 - Cindy L: Wow, I thought u muted us
3/15/16, 05:12 - Emos: i hv no service
3/15/16, 05:18 - Mom: change sim card
3/15/16, 05:40 - Mom: <Media omitted>
3/15/16, 05:41 - Mom: <Media omitted>
3/15/16, 05:44 - Mom: there is nothing abt the size of the hypothalamus on the MRI report
3/15/16, 05:45 - Mom: MRI scan also didn't mention anything abt the size of the internal organs
3/15/16, 08:28 - Mom: hello
3/15/16, 09:35 - Cindy L: Hi
3/15/16, 09:36 - Cindy L: The hypothalamus is in the middle of the brain, just dig out the scans and look for it.
3/15/16, 09:37 - Cindy L: Actually these days I've been good. Haven't really experienced a cataplectic attack yet.
3/15/16, 09:38 - Cindy L: Though I haven't really been in any funny situations
3/15/16, 09:39 - Cindy L: But I've been reading this book and the emotion we're looking for looks like it comes from the hypothalamus
3/15/16, 09:40 - Cindy L: And esp if it's abnormally simulated like being applied pressure on by a blood clot etc.
3/15/16, 09:44 - Mom: i've gone through every pages of ur mri scan already but there isn't any measurements for the hypothalamus and u can see from the report that it said everything is fine except with inflammation at the inside of ur nose
3/15/16, 09:44 - Cindy L: Hmm.... Fien then
3/15/16, 09:45 - Mom: rmb that u just took the plain mri, where we can't see any abnormality on the blood vessels
3/15/16, 09:45 - Cindy L: Oh rite
3/15/16, 09:45 - Mom: and this is the reason why i insisted to have a contrast mri the second time at dr wong chi keung's office
3/15/16, 09:45 - Cindy L: I was thinking what if there was a small blood clot right next to the hypothalamus
3/15/16, 09:46 - Mom: u hv to take the contrast one if there's anything abnormal abt the blood vessels
3/15/16, 09:46 - Cindy L: Yea
3/15/16, 09:46 - Cindy L: Nvm then
3/15/16, 09:46 - Cindy L: I've been taking cholinergic supplement and it seems to be working
3/15/16, 09:47 - Mom: but it's almost one and 1/2 yr, if there's a blood clot, that wud be cleared automatically until now
3/15/16, 09:47 - Cindy L: I managed to watch snow piercer without falling asleep
3/15/16, 09:47 - Mom: how's working?
3/15/16, 09:47 - Cindy L: In a dark room
3/15/16, 09:47 - Cindy L: Or maybe cuz I had coffee in the morning too but u get the idea
3/15/16, 09:48 - Mom: perhaps at the time of nov 14, we shud go st teresa hospital to take a contrast mri scan
3/15/16, 09:48 - Cindy L: Did we book one?
3/15/16, 09:48 - Cindy L: Lol
3/15/16, 09:49 - Cindy L: I hv learnt future bookings r useful
3/15/16, 09:49 - Mom: we did, but not paid by Ocean Park so we go to neuro dr in central, rmb?
3/15/16, 09:49 - Cindy L: Oh ok
3/15/16, 09:49 - Mom: and he just recommended a plain mri
3/15/16, 09:49 - Cindy L: Sure thing bub
3/15/16, 09:50 - Mom: at that time, we still didn't know there's difference between them, and the neuro dr seems didn't convince u had prob with the blood vessels in ur brain
3/15/16, 09:50 - Cindy L: Oh well
3/15/16, 09:51 - Mom: but think back now, we shud take the contrast mri in the first place
3/15/16, 09:51 - Cindy L: But they don't let u so i wouldn't hv gottten to do it
3/15/16, 09:52 - Mom: in fact, u had been examined by 4 neuro drs, they all didn't think u wud have blood vessel prob at this age, so they just ignore it
3/15/16, 09:53 - Mom: yea, if drs don't agree, we have to argue with them like the situation with dr wong, right?
3/15/16, 09:54 - Mom: but at the end of the day, the one taking u mri scan didn't do it!!!
3/15/16, 09:54 - Mom: ok, back to ur cholinergic supplement, what's it? and how's it working?
3/15/16, 09:54 - Mom: just not sleepy?
3/15/16, 09:56 - Cindy L: I managed to sit in a dark room and watch the whole of snowpiercer
3/15/16, 09:56 - Cindy L: That's it.
3/15/16, 09:56 - Mom: how long is that film?
3/15/16, 09:56 - Mom: 2 hrs?
3/15/16, 09:56 - Cindy L: The movie is around 2 hrs
3/15/16, 09:57 - Cindy L: That's not bad.
3/15/16, 09:57 - Cindy L: Usually I either fall asleep or slip into rem within first hr for 5-10 mins
3/15/16, 09:57 - Mom: ok good,
3/15/16, 09:58 - Mom: keep tracking daily abnormal events
3/15/16, 09:58 - Cindy L: l still hv cataplexy though
3/15/16, 09:58 - Mom: pershap ur brain is making so self-adjustment
3/15/16, 09:58 - Cindy L: Er I've been taking L carnite pills
3/15/16, 09:58 - Cindy L: And the ginseng
3/15/16, 09:59 - Mom: what's it?
3/15/16, 09:59 - Cindy L: Choline
3/15/16, 10:00 - Mom: nvm, it's just supplement, won't do much harm
3/15/16, 10:00 - Mom: choline is rich in eggs
3/15/16, 10:03 - Cindy L: It's the precursor of acetycholine
3/15/16, 10:04 - Mom: cc
3/15/16, 11:25 - Cindy L: Oww for some reason whenever I wear the retainer I get ulcers
3/15/16, 11:25 - Cindy L: On my tongue
3/15/16, 11:32 - Mom: did u medicate the retainer?
3/15/16, 11:32 - Mom: r there mould or bateria on ur retainer?
3/15/16, 11:35 - Cindy L: You mean use the polident?
3/15/16, 11:35 - Cindy L: Yea
3/15/16, 11:35 - Cindy L: When it looks dirty
3/15/16, 11:36 - Mom: if u get ulcers, it shud be bacteria on ur retainer
3/15/16, 11:37 - Mom: clean it everyday la
3/15/16, 11:38 - Mom: another thing might be ur retainer need fine tuned
3/15/16, 11:57 - Cindy L: Its the places which keep rubbing against the plastic
3/15/16, 11:57 - Cindy L: I think it might be bacteria
3/15/16, 11:57 - Cindy L: I better get a mouth wash
3/15/16, 12:00 - Mom: hahahaha
3/15/16, 17:45 - Cindy L: Yooo
3/15/16, 17:46 - Cindy L: Do u thinking I should write
3/15/16, 17:48 - Cindy L: I hope to study neuroscience because adopting a scientific mentality has become a kind of coping mechanism for me
3/15/16, 17:51 - Mom: i dont knoe what u want to say in this msg?
3/15/16, 17:52 - Cindy L: Like studying the shit out of the brain is how I cope with narco
3/15/16, 17:52 - Cindy L: Whaddya think
3/15/16, 17:52 - Cindy L: Is that even a reason
3/15/16, 17:52 - Cindy L: Seems a bit unhealthy
3/15/16, 17:53 - Mom: but ppl dont knoe u suffer from narco
3/15/16, 17:53 - Cindy L: Err they do I wrote abt it.
3/15/16, 17:53 - Mom: oh
3/15/16, 17:53 - Cindy L: Well I kind of wrote abt it like it's the coolest thing ever.
3/15/16, 17:54 - Mom: ur goint to tell everybody?
3/15/16, 17:54 - Cindy L: Like i sort of mention it and then talk abt what I find cool abt the brain
3/15/16, 17:54 - Cindy L: Err I'm just submitting to NW so only northwestern will know
3/15/16, 17:55 - Mom: done already?
3/15/16, 17:55 - Cindy L: Pretty much
3/15/16, 17:56 - Cindy L: Just writing the statement
3/15/16, 17:56 - Mom: errr....
3/15/16, 17:56 - Cindy L: Well polishing it
3/15/16, 17:57 - Cindy L: Like basically I said, I experienced weird shit and it got me into this whole shebang
3/15/16, 17:57 - Mom: i still hv reservation, dont think ppl will easily be convinced with ur ability then?
3/15/16, 17:57 - Cindy L: Er not really
3/15/16, 17:57 - Cindy L: Cuz admissions will read it
3/15/16, 17:58 - Cindy L: And chances r they don't know what the fuck is narcolepsy
3/15/16, 17:58 - Mom: did u say u hv this diagnosis?
3/15/16, 17:58 - Cindy L: Not really? I just kind of mentioned that I hv this label?
3/15/16, 17:59 - Mom: Âí™ÂÑçÂï¶Ôºånarco is pretty common in us i believed
3/15/16, 17:59 - Cindy L: 1 in 2000
3/15/16, 17:59 - Cindy L: But dude I'm reading it and it sounds pretty damn convincing
3/15/16, 17:59 - Mom: the ratio is pretty high
3/15/16, 18:01 - Mom: this is a rlly convincing reason but this derives another issue - ur ability to cope the course and pressure
3/15/16, 18:02 - Cindy L: But nw is chill
3/15/16, 18:03 - Mom: sorry no comment, i dont know that uni and the admission staff there
3/15/16, 18:03 - Cindy L: ...
3/15/16, 18:03 - Cindy L: Well I thought abt it for a loooong time
3/15/16, 18:03 - Cindy L: And I tried writing a few statements without mentioning it
3/15/16, 18:04 - Cindy L: I mean I couldnt really.
3/15/16, 18:04 - Mom: how do u know their attitude towards this thing? just by readig their website?
3/15/16, 18:04 - Cindy L: Nvmvm I was just kidding.
3/15/16, 18:06 - Mom: i mean u can tell ppl abt ur case but only after getting to know them well
3/15/16, 18:06 - Cindy L: Yea I guess.
3/15/16, 18:06 - Cindy L: And partly whether I bother to or not
3/15/16, 18:06 - Mom: this is not comon cold or flu
3/15/16, 18:06 - Cindy L: Most people here are like oh, really and they just continue with life
3/15/16, 18:07 - Cindy L: And that's how I would expect mature people to react I guess.
3/15/16, 18:07 - Cindy L: I mean if someone told u that they had depression and slit their wrists I wouldn't be like oooh, this person is crazy
3/15/16, 18:08 - Cindy L: Tbh only HK people react like that and that's really a problem with the mentality of HK ppl.
3/15/16, 18:08 - Mom: two sides: (1) ppl rlly dont care, (2) ppl dont want to care
3/15/16, 18:08 - Cindy L: Most people here treat depression as a pretty serious issue
3/15/16, 18:09 - Cindy L: I mean I'm fine with people who don't care
3/15/16, 18:09 - Cindy L: It's not their problem after all
3/15/16, 18:09 - Cindy L: But with HK people they treat u like u're a crazy person afterwards and that's really annoying.
3/15/16, 18:10 - Mom: yea, but if ur going to work them, that wud be another story
3/15/16, 18:10 - Mom: hk ppl is apathetic
3/15/16, 18:10 - Cindy L: Thats a different issue
3/15/16, 18:10 - Cindy L: No they treat u like ur crazy.
3/15/16, 18:11 - Mom: and mostly rather selfish
3/15/16, 18:11 - Mom: depression?
3/15/16, 18:11 - Cindy L: Pretty much
3/15/16, 18:11 - Mom: or narco?
3/15/16, 18:13 - Cindy L: All of them
3/15/16, 18:13 - Cindy L: I guess with depression people just assume u were too weak to cope with the stress
3/15/16, 18:14 - Cindy L: Like a true Hong konger
3/15/16, 18:14 - Cindy L: Anyways they can't reject cuz of narco
3/15/16, 18:15 - Cindy L: And Americans are very gungho abt diversity
3/15/16, 18:15 - Mom: sure
3/15/16, 18:16 - Cindy L: I just feel like people just don't think u're very special if u hv this kind of thing.
3/15/16, 18:16 - Mom: and if they decide not to accept, they wont use narco as an excuse
3/15/16, 18:16 - Cindy L: Kinda disappointed with the reaction I get sometimes when I explain cataplexy
3/15/16, 18:16 - Cindy L: I mean it is pretty weird
3/15/16, 18:17 - Mom: this is nothing special cuz in us ppl have different kind os weird disorders
3/15/16, 18:17 - Mom: how ppl react?
3/15/16, 18:22 - Cindy L: Dunno they re more open abt medical stufd
3/15/16, 18:22 - Mom: u hv to think in the place of an ordinary person not from ur own standpoint
3/15/16, 18:22 - Cindy L: I mean for godsake they can even tolerate two men getting married
3/15/16, 18:22 - Cindy L: No that I dont
3/15/16, 18:25 - Mom: i accept two men getting married as well and i also can understand how a patient feel but when things involved working with physical strength, illness is def a concern
3/15/16, 18:27 - Mom: like most boss dont want to hire women at senior rank bc of their physical inferior like giving birth of baby ....
3/15/16, 18:31 - Cindy L: Yes ofc
3/15/16, 18:31 - Cindy L: But this is a RESEARCH university
3/15/16, 18:34 - Mom: I'm not trying to ÊΩëÂÜ∑Ê∞¥ÔºåI just want to pinpoint my concern, which I think u shud be prepared for
3/15/16, 18:34 - Cindy L: Yea
3/15/16, 18:34 - Cindy L: But gotta take risks sometimes
3/15/16, 18:35 - Mom: If I were u, I wudnt tell them directly
3/15/16, 18:36 - Mom: I wud just write it as a third person
3/15/16, 18:40 - Mom: Anyway, u can still go ahead with ur plan, perhaps I'm overly worried
3/15/16, 18:41 - Cindy L: Lol I tried the I hv a friend method
3/15/16, 23:23 - Cindy L: Shiiiit
3/15/16, 23:24 - Cindy L: Just found out Janet is super smart
3/15/16, 23:24 - Cindy L: 2380 sats
3/15/16, 23:24 - Cindy L: üòë
3/15/16, 23:32 - Mom: what's her ib score?

3/16/16, 09:52 - Mom: cc

3/16/16, 09:53 - Cindy L: Yea exactly
3/16/16, 09:53 - Mom: cheating?
3/16/16, 09:53 - Cindy L: No, their year has more smart ppl than we do
3/16/16, 09:54 - Mom: don't understand why her ib and sat scores r so good, still has to go to kcl?
3/16/16, 09:54 - Cindy L: Yea fair point.
3/16/16, 09:54 - Cindy L: Did u find her in the year book?
3/16/16, 09:54 - Mom: cambridge, lse? no offer?
3/16/16, 09:54 - Cindy L: Well it can't be bad.
3/16/16, 09:54 - Cindy L: She did law at kcl
3/16/16, 09:55 - Cindy L: Well Oxbridge is difficult.
3/16/16, 09:55 - Cindy L: But surely lse must accept
3/16/16, 09:55 - Cindy L: Damn I wanted to work for admissions so I can see
3/16/16, 09:57 - Mom: janet chen?
3/16/16, 09:58 - Mom: if lse has offer, normal ppl wud choose lse over kcl for law?
3/16/16, 09:59 - Mom: Albert Zhang? also 42
3/16/16, 09:59 - Mom: where is this guy?
3/16/16, 09:59 - Cindy L: Yea Janet chen
3/16/16, 09:59 - Cindy L: Albert is at cornell
3/16/16, 10:00 - Mom: janet is 42
3/16/16, 10:00 - Cindy L: Woe
3/16/16, 10:00 - Cindy L: Well they both got reject from mit
3/16/16, 10:01 - Cindy L: Maybe it's statement
3/16/16, 10:01 - Cindy L: Neither of them can write
3/16/16, 10:01 - Mom: i think it's the residence status
3/16/16, 10:01 - Cindy L: So they're more lenient to u if ur British?
3/16/16, 10:01 - Mom: us unis give priority to us residence
3/16/16, 10:02 - Mom: don't know
3/16/16, 10:02 - Cindy L: Oh yea OK that us
3/16/16, 10:02 - Cindy L: But I can't figure out why she went to kinga
3/16/16, 10:02 - Mom: so janet does law again in nw?
3/16/16, 10:02 - Mom: this is the Q?
3/16/16, 10:02 - Cindy L: No she switched to bme
3/16/16, 10:02 - Mom: ic
3/16/16, 10:02 - Cindy L: Oh NW has design eng
3/16/16, 10:02 - Cindy L: Lol
3/16/16, 10:03 - Mom: that's not reasonable, she must have a 45 predicted ib scores at the time of doing uni application, so even ucl didn't offer?
3/16/16, 10:04 - Cindy L: No she must hv applied for law
3/16/16, 10:04 - Cindy L: In ucas
3/16/16, 10:04 - Cindy L: And eng in the states
3/16/16, 10:04 - Cindy L: And since she's not a good writer
3/16/16, 10:04 - Cindy L: Her statement was mediocre
3/16/16, 10:04 - Mom: u think it's the writing prob?
3/16/16, 10:04 - Cindy L: That's my guess
3/16/16, 10:05 - Cindy L: Seems to be
3/16/16, 10:05 - Mom: but she still got a 7 at ib right?
3/16/16, 10:05 - Cindy L: Yea that's true
3/16/16, 10:05 - Mom: or even 6 won't be that bad
3/16/16, 10:05 - Mom: hmmm
3/16/16, 10:05 - Cindy L: But still I only got a 6 in eng
3/16/16, 10:06 - Mom: it's u exam tech prob, i thought u shud justify for a 7
3/16/16, 10:06 - Cindy L: I dunno statement seems to be more important than I thought it would be
3/16/16, 10:06 - Mom: think of ur sat scores?
3/16/16, 10:06 - Cindy L: My SATs score wasnt great
3/16/16, 10:07 - Cindy L: But the highest I think was Ryan's which was around 2200 something
3/16/16, 10:07 - Mom: it bears no indicative bc ppl can practise alot for sat
3/16/16, 10:08 - Mom: did janet have any offer from us uni at the beginning?
3/16/16, 10:10 - Cindy L: Not sure
3/16/16, 10:10 - Cindy L: I checked yesterday that I'm still within the interquartile range so I guess I sort of fit the criteria
3/16/16, 10:11 - Mom: nvm la
3/16/16, 10:11 - Mom: u sent the application already?
3/16/16, 10:12 - Cindy L: Yea
3/16/16, 10:12 - Cindy L: Maybe I should apply NYU too then.
3/16/16, 10:16 - Mom: u decide la
3/16/16, 10:16 - Cindy L: There's still time dw
3/16/16, 10:17 - Cindy L: I need to start asking around abt the ucb thing.
3/16/16, 10:17 - Cindy L: But I heard that it's super popular
3/16/16, 10:18 - Cindy L: üòí
3/16/16, 10:19 - Cindy L: Last resort is to spend two summers doing the intensive chem courses
3/16/16, 10:19 - Cindy L: Should be good enough after that
3/16/16, 10:21 - Mom: 10 places, def competitive la
3/16/16, 10:22 - Cindy L: Also that it's insanely popular
3/16/16, 10:22 - Mom: besides, even if u can go to ucb, what subjects can u choose? nothing related to poli sci and econ?
3/16/16, 10:22 - Cindy L: U still need to pay ucb fees at a discounted rate
3/16/16, 10:23 - Mom: this is another Q
3/16/16, 10:23 - Cindy L: So ppl on loans would struggle
3/16/16, 10:23 - Mom: ic
3/16/16, 10:23 - Cindy L: So there would be 50 of the yr who cn apply
3/16/16, 10:23 - Cindy L: 50%
3/16/16, 10:23 - Mom: but just going there for 1 yr, nothing can be added to ur science major?
3/16/16, 10:24 - Cindy L: To take the necessary chem courses.
3/16/16, 10:24 - Cindy L: Or do u mean my current t bsc?
3/16/16, 10:24 - Mom: do u think that's enough for a master in neurosci?
3/16/16, 10:25 - Cindy L: Yea they consider people from science degrees as well
3/16/16, 10:26 - Cindy L: Hmmm
3/16/16, 10:26 - Mom: just wait and see what comes in a few months' time
3/16/16, 10:27 - Cindy L: Yea
3/16/16, 10:27 - Mom: if everything didn't work, go consider ucb again
3/16/16, 10:27 - Cindy L: Ok
3/16/16, 10:28 - Mom: and u can still apply for transfer to uc at the end of ur first yr when official results come out
3/16/16, 10:29 - Mom: DHL still hasn't deliver u the ginseng extract?
3/16/16, 10:32 - Cindy L: No
3/16/16, 10:32 - Mom: why?
3/16/16, 10:32 - Cindy L: I forgot to reschedule the delivery
3/16/16, 10:32 - Mom: didn't u ask for redelivery?
3/16/16, 10:33 - Cindy L: No I had to pay at the duty division
3/16/16, 10:33 - Mom: u had to pay?
3/16/16, 10:33 - Cindy L: And then rescheduling is done by a different division
3/16/16, 10:33 - Mom: but u paid already right?
3/16/16, 10:33 - Cindy L: Pay the vat
3/16/16, 10:33 - Mom: yea
3/16/16, 10:33 - Mom: u paid already

3/16/16, 10:33 - Cindy L: But I hv to reschedule
3/16/16, 10:34 - Cindy L: Look I hv to deal with different ppl to get it delivered and London ppl pretty much only work from 11-3 which is fucking ridiculous
3/16/16, 10:35 - Cindy L: Which reminds me I need to go to the bank as well
3/16/16, 10:36 - Mom: ei ya
3/16/16, 10:36 - Mom: so many work to do
3/16/16, 10:37 - Cindy L: Londoners r fucking lazy slobs and drunk most of the time.
3/16/16, 10:38 - Mom: don't complain, just get ur things done la
3/16/16, 10:38 - Cindy L: I've been waiting to hear back from registry for the past few days already

3/16/16, 10:38 - Mom: registry? for what?

3/16/16, 14:49 - Cindy L: slow as fuck
3/16/16, 14:49 - Mom: why the bank charges u 20 pounds for transfering money?
3/16/16, 14:49 - Cindy L: no so
3/16/16, 14:49 - Cindy L: i tell the whole story now
3/16/16, 14:50 - Cindy L: so i submitted my common app (CA) yesterday
3/16/16, 14:50 - Cindy L: there is an application fee of $75
3/16/16, 14:50 - Cindy L: well they redirected me to this thing called flywire
3/16/16, 14:51 - Cindy L: so i have to pay through flywire to pay common app to pay northwestern
3/16/16, 14:51 - Cindy L: and flywire offered me 3 three methods:
3/16/16, 14:51 - Cindy L: 1. pay through bank transfer
3/16/16, 14:51 - Cindy L: 2. pay with credit card
3/16/16, 14:51 - Cindy L: 3. pay through wire
3/16/16, 14:51 - Cindy L: so bank transfer was the only one without extra charges
3/16/16, 14:52 - Mom: no, ur wrong
3/16/16, 14:52 - Cindy L: yep i know now
3/16/16, 14:52 - Cindy L: but all the other ones charged me like massive amounts of money
3/16/16, 14:52 - Mom: bank transfer always incur a charge which is higher than credit card
3/16/16, 14:53 - Mom: u shud pay by hsbc credit card, which i've told u to do so
3/16/16, 14:53 - Cindy L: anyways
3/16/16, 14:53 - Cindy L: i realised that i chose the wrong freaking option
3/16/16, 14:54 - Cindy L: and i'm trying to see if i can change the payment option
3/16/16, 14:54 - Cindy L: secondly
3/16/16, 14:54 - Mom: when it comes to $, u have to listen to my opinion
3/16/16, 14:55 - Cindy L: i frogot
3/16/16, 14:55 - Cindy L: ah
3/16/16, 14:55 - Cindy L: they show me a list of options iwth like massive amounts of charges for each one
3/16/16, 14:55 - Cindy L: ofc i didn't know anything i chose the free one
3/16/16, 14:55 - Cindy L: which turns out to cost the most
3/16/16, 14:56 - Cindy L: and by credit charges, do u mean charges to visa or flywire
3/16/16, 14:56 - Cindy L: cuz i swear flywire expects u to pay them too
3/16/16, 14:56 - Mom: visa
3/16/16, 14:56 - Mom: how much they charge?
3/16/16, 14:56 - Cindy L: 7 pp
3/16/16, 14:56 - Cindy L: i think
3/16/16, 14:57 - Mom: they didn't show it on the screen?
3/16/16, 14:57 - Mom: if they said no charges on bank transfer, why the hell there's charges now? ask them?
3/16/16, 14:57 - Cindy L: charges are bea charges
3/16/16, 14:58 - Cindy L: i just went to the bank
3/16/16, 14:57 - Mom: and ask them to explain
3/16/16, 14:58 - Cindy L: explain what?
3/16/16, 14:59 - Mom: 20 pounds almost 1/2 of the $75, which is unreasonable
3/16/16, 15:00 - Cindy L: no i just went to  bea and they said if i transfer using their system the charge is 20pp
3/16/16, 15:00 - Cindy L: who care whats reasonable
3/16/16, 15:00 - Cindy L: ur money is in their bank
3/16/16, 15:00 - Mom: which credit card u used?
3/16/16, 15:00 - Cindy L: i didn't use a credit card
3/16/16, 15:01 - Cindy L: i haven't paid the application fee
3/16/16, 15:01 - Mom: why?
3/16/16, 15:01 - Cindy L: because i'm supposed to transfer it through bank transfer
3/16/16, 15:01 - Mom: why haven't paid the application fee?
3/16/16, 15:01 - Cindy L: ok lemme explain again
3/16/16, 15:01 - Mom: they debit ur card already?
3/16/16, 15:02 - Cindy L: no just shut up and listen
3/16/16, 15:02 - Cindy L: the common application has partnered with peertransfer education to process international payments
3/16/16, 15:02 - Cindy L: so in order to pay the application fee to northwestern
3/16/16, 15:02 - Cindy L: i have to pay through this system called flywire
3/16/16, 15:03 - Mom: i understand the process
3/16/16, 15:03 - Mom: so if haven't paid, change to other method
3/16/16, 15:03 - Cindy L: ok so basically i opted to pay by bank transfer
3/16/16, 15:03 - Cindy L: and now i'm locked into it and all i can do is pay or cancel the payment
3/16/16, 15:03 - Mom: cancel the payment
3/16/16, 15:04 - Mom: cuz u have to go to bea to do the bank transfer, i know
3/16/16, 15:04 - Cindy L: yes i just went
3/16/16, 15:04 - Cindy L: and they told me to do a transfer through their CHAPS system, they will charge me 20 pp
3/16/16, 15:04 - Mom: why u know it's 20 pounds
3/16/16, 15:05 - Mom: yea, i know
3/16/16, 15:05 - Cindy L: cuz i asked them at the bank
3/16/16, 15:05 - Mom: paying through chaps is expensive
3/16/16, 15:05 - Mom: so, if u cancel the payment, no need to pay by bank transfer right?
3/16/16, 15:05 - Cindy L: she said the only option is to write a cheque
3/16/16, 15:06 - Cindy L: no if i cancel the payment i don't even know what happens to my app
3/16/16, 15:06 - Mom: write a cheque to where? nw?
3/16/16, 15:06 - Cindy L: bea said this
3/16/16, 15:06 - Cindy L: ok
3/16/16, 15:06 - Cindy L: bea said i can write a cheque, but i don't know who or what to write it to
3/16/16, 15:06 - Mom: u don't have a us$ cheque a/c
3/16/16, 15:06 - Cindy L: so that's not an option
3/16/16, 15:06 - Mom: so impossible to write a us$ chq
3/16/16, 15:06 - Cindy L: no i'm paying in gbp
3/16/16, 15:07 - Mom: why gbp? that's 75usd
3/16/16, 15:07 - Mom: u can't write a chq to pay for usd
3/16/16, 15:07 - Cindy L: that's where peertransfer comes into pay
3/16/16, 15:07 - Cindy L: u can pay peertransfer ur home currency and they pay the universities in usd
3/16/16, 15:08 - Cindy L: actually peertransfer forces u to pay in ur current currency
3/16/16, 15:08 - Mom: ok, then u can write a chq in gbp and pay to peertransfer right?
3/16/16, 15:08 - Cindy L: no
3/16/16, 15:08 - Cindy L: because i dunno if they accept cheque, probably not and they're based in america
3/16/16, 15:08 - Mom: ofc, how can u do that?
3/16/16, 15:09 - Mom: i think u can cancel the payment and the application wud direct u to pay again
3/16/16, 15:09 - Cindy L: yea
3/16/16, 15:09 - Cindy L: second problem
3/16/16, 15:10 - Cindy L: i sent them my transcripts and got the reply i showed u earlier
3/16/16, 15:10 - Mom: if not, just submit the application again and tell nw that there's something wrong with the payment procedure so u have to submit the application once again
3/16/16, 15:10 - Cindy L: that means i need to pay careers to send my transcript
3/16/16, 15:10 - Mom: normally, uni in this situation wud accept
3/16/16, 15:10 - Mom: yea, that's normal
3/16/16, 15:11 - Cindy L: what ever that's 20pp
3/16/16, 15:11 - Mom: uni usually only accept transcript to be sent by originate agencies
3/16/16, 15:11 - Mom: 20 pp what?
3/16/16, 15:11 - Cindy L: oh no i mean $500 or else they will take 6 weeks to send my shit over
3/16/16, 15:12 - Mom: u mean ur career service charges 20 pp for lse transcript?
3/16/16, 15:12 - Cindy L: no
3/16/16, 15:12 - Cindy L: kgv careers charges $500 to send materials
3/16/16, 15:12 - Cindy L: i don't know if lse offers such services
3/16/16, 15:12 - Mom: pay la
3/16/16, 15:12 - Mom: go ask la
3/16/16, 15:13 - Cindy L: i don't even know who or what to ask
3/16/16, 15:13 - Mom: where u got ur lse transcript?
3/16/16, 15:13 - Cindy L: registry has not responded for the past few days.
3/16/16, 15:13 - Mom: chase again, ok?
3/16/16, 15:15 - Cindy L: i'm so tired i wanna kill myself
3/16/16, 15:14 - Mom: okay, what did u sent to nw abt the transcript at lse?
3/16/16, 15:15 - Mom: patient la
3/16/16, 15:15 - Cindy L: what do you mean? you mean what did i send to nw in the place of my lse transcript?
3/16/16, 15:16 - Mom: yea
3/16/16, 15:17 - Cindy L: i sent what is called a 'module certificate'
3/16/16, 15:18 - Mom: is that from lse?
3/16/16, 15:18 - Mom: where did u get that?
3/16/16, 15:18 - Cindy L: no i pulled it out of my ass, ofc its from lse.
3/16/16, 15:18 - Cindy L: a module certificate, which will provide you with written confirmation of the courses you have studied during your first year of study.
3/16/16, 15:18 - Mom: so who compile this modular certificate?
3/16/16, 15:19 - Cindy L: and also includes a little explanation of why i don't have  a certificate at the moment
3/16/16, 15:19 - Cindy L: REGISTRY
3/16/16, 15:19 - Cindy L: they're very fast with standard requests
3/16/16, 15:19 - Cindy L: but anything other than at
3/16/16, 15:19 - Mom: so just go to registry and ask them to send that cert to nw directly
3/16/16, 15:19 - Cindy L: months
3/16/16, 15:20 - Cindy L: i can't go to registry
3/16/16, 15:20 - Cindy L: they don't have a front desk
3/16/16, 15:20 - Mom: why?
3/16/16, 15:20 - Cindy L: IF I KNEW I'D BE WINNING A NOBEL PRIZE WON'T I
3/16/16, 15:20 - Mom: how long the registry issued u this cert?
3/16/16, 15:20 - Cindy L: like a week
3/16/16, 15:21 - Cindy L: they still haven't responded to my enquiries
3/16/16, 15:21 - Mom: okay, that's simple
3/16/16, 15:21 - Mom: email registry and ask them to send this modular cert directly to nw, that's it
3/16/16, 15:21 - Mom: all nw want is that
3/16/16, 15:21 - Cindy L: yea ok i'll see if they reply
3/16/16, 15:22 - Cindy L: maybe not
3/16/16, 15:22 - Mom: what did u ask the registry that they haven't reply?
3/16/16, 15:22 - Cindy L: some registration policy to be cleared up
3/16/16, 15:22 - Mom: and for kgv transcript, pay to kgv and they'll do it, that's it
3/16/16, 15:22 - Cindy L: which my advisor told me to check
3/16/16, 15:22 - Cindy L: omg this is all so annoying
3/16/16, 15:23 - Mom: still haven't registered properly?
3/16/16, 15:23 - Cindy L: no theres this question on the college report which asks whether i'm eligible to go back to lse
3/16/16, 15:24 - Cindy L: and if u tick no, u have to provide more written work. i'm not even sure what they question asks for really.
3/16/16, 15:25 - Mom: what does that mean? the college report is from common app?
3/16/16, 15:25 - Cindy L: no the college report is the name of one of the thousands of forms u need to fill out
3/16/16, 15:25 - Mom: how come u can't go back to lse?
3/16/16, 15:26 - Cindy L: well if transfer is success ofc u can't go back
3/16/16, 15:26 - Cindy L: u already withdraw
3/16/16, 15:26 - Cindy L: that's just like a dumb question
3/16/16, 15:26 - Mom: if u withdraw, then why go back
3/16/16, 15:26 - Mom: once u haven't withdrawn, ur still a lse student
3/16/16, 15:27 - Mom: just tick yes
3/16/16, 15:27 - Cindy L: I DONT KNOW, the college report asks for it
3/16/16, 15:27 - Mom: don't bother to ask
3/16/16, 15:27 - Cindy L: also third point
3/16/16, 15:27 - Cindy L: if i try uc apps next term
3/16/16, 15:27 - Cindy L: i'm gonna have to go through all of this pain again
3/16/16, 15:27 - Mom: so?
3/16/16, 15:28 - Cindy L: just u'll have to pay all of this again
3/16/16, 15:28 - Mom: anytime, u do application, that cause $
3/16/16, 15:28 - Cindy L: but i'm paying the fucking application fee
3/16/16, 15:29 - Cindy L: already
3/16/16, 15:29 - Mom: u can't think of too much abt that
3/16/16, 15:29 - Cindy L: i don't even know how to pay kgv
3/16/16, 15:29 - Mom: u said u didn't, why now paid already?
3/16/16, 15:29 - Mom: u haven't do the bank transfer right?
3/16/16, 15:31 - Cindy L: <Media omitted>
3/16/16, 15:31 - Mom: pay by credit card, i'll do it for u
3/16/16, 15:31 - Cindy L: I get these options so I don't know which one.
3/16/16, 15:32 - Cindy L: It says debit card is fine so I pay with debit
3/16/16, 15:34 - Cindy L: Yo do I pay in debit?
3/16/16, 15:34 - Mom: why 58 pounds not 55 pp? do u know?
3/16/16, 15:35 - Cindy L: Cuz u need to pay service for visa
3/16/16, 15:35 - Cindy L: And service for flywire
3/16/16, 15:35 - Mom: i know it la
3/16/16, 15:35 - Mom: pay by debit card
3/16/16, 15:36 - Mom: that's altogether 10pp charge
3/16/16, 15:36 - Cindy L: Yea
3/16/16, 15:36 - Cindy L: Oh waiy
3/16/16, 15:36 - Cindy L: Visa uses a different rate I think
3/16/16, 15:37 - Cindy L: But I hv no choice do i
3/16/16, 15:38 - Mom: even with different rate, that won't be 10 pp difference
3/16/16, 15:38 - Cindy L: Yes it will I told u its 7 pp charge
3/16/16, 15:39 - Mom: i shud sent the app for u in hk, which wud be easier
3/16/16, 15:39 - Cindy L: What do u mean
3/16/16, 15:39 - Cindy L: U need to pay through peertransfer
3/16/16, 15:40 - Mom: but that wud be in hk$
3/16/16, 15:40 - Mom: nvm, forget abt it
3/16/16, 15:40 - Cindy L: No because u need to pay in the current of the country u r in
3/16/16, 15:41 - Mom: nvm, just pay by debit visa
3/16/16, 15:41 - Cindy L: So I paid
3/16/16, 15:41 - Mom: this option is the optimum
3/16/16, 15:41 - Cindy L: Suddenly ismts 64pp
3/16/16, 15:42 - Cindy L: Whateevrbi just paid
3/16/16, 15:42 - Mom: altogether 64pp?
3/16/16, 15:42 - Cindy L: Yes
3/16/16, 15:42 - Mom: 58+7=65?
3/16/16, 15:42 - Cindy L: I know
3/16/16, 15:42 - Mom: that's correct
3/16/16, 15:42 - Cindy L: 64?
3/16/16, 15:42 - Mom: so that's 64 in the end
3/16/16, 15:43 - Cindy L: No 58 +7 is 65
3/16/16, 15:43 - Cindy L: Oh eait
3/16/16, 15:43 - Mom: nvm, how much they charged in the end?
3/16/16, 15:43 - Cindy L: 64
3/16/16, 15:44 - Mom: that's correct
3/16/16, 15:44 - Mom: cuz 55 or 58 might be a rounding figure
3/16/16, 15:46 - Mom: now: (1) reply the nw uni that ur going to have those reports sent to them directly from lse/kgv
3/16/16, 15:46 - Mom: (2) ask lse registry to send the modular cert to nw directly
3/16/16, 15:46 - Cindy L: I'll get them to send my ref and transcript then
3/16/16, 15:47 - Mom: (3) ask kgv to send ur transcript to nw directly and ask them the way they accept payment and tell me if i can arrange it here in hk
3/16/16, 15:47 - Mom: completed
3/16/16, 15:48 - Cindy L: Completed what?
3/16/16, 15:48 - Cindy L: I hate my phone so much, it lags like shit.
3/16/16, 15:48 - Mom: that's the end of the whole app process
3/16/16, 15:49 - Mom: ur phone has too much thing, might be
3/16/16, 15:50 - Mom: okay?
3/16/16, 15:56 - Cindy L: on the form kgv accepts cheques
3/16/16, 15:57 - Cindy L: honesty i feel like ucl like take me for natural sciences
3/16/16, 15:58 - Cindy L: will take me
3/16/16, 15:59 - Mom: but u have already submit nw app already right? and order the sat report as well?
3/16/16, 15:59 - Cindy L: yes
3/16/16, 15:59 - Cindy L: i already paid most of the money
3/16/16, 15:59 - Mom: want to give up now? just for 500hkd
3/16/16, 15:59 - Cindy L: no i already filled out the form
3/16/16, 16:00 - Mom: is there a deadline for nw to receive all the transcript?
3/16/16, 16:00 - Cindy L: preferably before they make offers?
3/16/16, 16:00 - Mom: so not yet paid?
3/16/16, 16:00 - Cindy L: what do you mean? i already filled out the form
3/16/16, 16:00 - Cindy L: i'm sending it right now
3/16/16, 16:01 - Cindy L: what on earth are you going on about
3/16/16, 16:13 - Mom: Ë¨õ‰πúÂëÄÔºü
3/16/16, 16:14 - Mom: i mean nw must have a deadline for transfer applicants to arrange supporting documents being sent to them for consideration of application? is there a deadline for it?
3/16/16, 16:15 - Mom: fill out what form ah?
3/16/16, 16:16 - Mom: if nw allows 6-8 wks, then u don't have to pay 500hkd but just 200 la?
3/16/16, 16:53 - Cindy L: Its sometime in early April
3/16/16, 16:53 - Cindy L: They release offers in 6-8 weeks
3/16/16, 16:53 - Cindy L: üòì
3/16/16, 16:54 - Cindy L: So it will hv to be 500
3/16/16, 16:54 - Cindy L: Anyways.
3/16/16, 16:55 - Cindy L: I just went to a society meeting basically a group of students sitting in a room worrying abt funding.
3/16/16, 16:55 - Cindy L: I come to the conclusion that there is no way that the lse will chose me for ucb exchange program based on their funding decisions.
3/16/16, 16:58 - Cindy L: I think they'd be more likely to choose me if I said I was going to go there and study documentary making and make  a film abt minority rights in California
3/16/16, 17:00 - Cindy L: Never thought I'd be a student angsting abt funding and bureaucracy one day
3/16/16, 17:01 - Cindy L: Twenty years later Id be a researcher/ manager angsting abt funding and bureaucracy
3/16/16, 17:04 - Mom: what is it? funding?
3/16/16, 17:06 - Cindy L: Yah societies need funds
3/16/16, 17:06 - Cindy L: For snacks
3/16/16, 17:06 - Mom: so, why is it related to ucb program?
3/16/16, 17:06 - Cindy L: It's not
3/16/16, 17:07 - Cindy L: But I do need to fill up the black hole in my CV
3/16/16, 17:07 - Cindy L: Oh u mean lse funding decisions
3/16/16, 17:07 - Cindy L: Lol
3/16/16, 17:07 - Mom: what black hole? don't get it
3/16/16, 17:08 - Cindy L: Hahaha lsr funding decisions r so weird
3/16/16, 17:08 - Cindy L: But based on what they choose to fund
3/16/16, 17:08 - Cindy L: I can say narcoleptic research is unlikely to be one of them
3/16/16, 17:09 - Cindy L: So they r definitely not buying that one
3/16/16, 17:09 - Mom: ic ur point now
3/16/16, 17:09 - Cindy L: On the other hand if I said I had an entrepreneurial idea
3/16/16, 17:09 - Mom: how the hell lse need to do narcoleptic research?
3/16/16, 17:09 - Cindy L: That may perhaps work
3/16/16, 17:10 - Cindy L: At least if I looked into peptide production, that's sort of related to econ
3/16/16, 17:11 - Mom: lol
3/16/16, 17:11 - Cindy L: Anyhow, I realize I haven't done the most important thing.
3/16/16, 17:11 - Mom: ?
3/16/16, 17:11 - Cindy L: I haven't ask the neuroscience Dept's what they accept for masters course
3/16/16, 17:11 - Mom: where? nw?
3/16/16, 17:12 - Cindy L: I haven't asked any.
3/16/16, 17:12 - Cindy L: I should sort out what I actually need to get in
3/16/16, 17:12 - Cindy L: Lol
3/16/16, 17:13 - Mom: yea, but no hurry, u still have lots of time to sort that out
3/16/16, 17:13 - Cindy L: Not really I have two summers to make up
3/16/16, 17:13 - Cindy L: I know med school is actually pretty easy to make up for
3/16/16, 17:14 - Mom: u still have enough time to ask until this summer
3/16/16, 17:14 - Cindy L: Just need organic chem
3/16/16, 17:14 - Cindy L: Yes that true
3/16/16, 17:14 - Mom: where med school? us or uk?
3/16/16, 17:14 - Cindy L: UK lah
3/16/16, 17:14 - Cindy L: Us is like lottery again
3/16/16, 17:15 - Mom: ic
3/16/16, 17:15 - Mom: organic chem only? no bio courses?
3/16/16, 17:16 - Cindy L: No organic chem, and bmat or gamsat
3/16/16, 17:16 - Mom: what does the bmat test for? i mean the syllabus?
3/16/16, 17:17 - Cindy L: It's like basic science
3/16/16, 17:17 - Mom: basic sci, so there're physics, chem and bio right?
3/16/16, 17:17 - Mom: but u didn't have a-level chem and bio?
3/16/16, 17:17 - Cindy L: Yea but it's the basic stuff like gcse and below
3/16/16, 17:17 - Mom: ic
3/16/16, 17:18 - Mom: so it wudn't be a prob la
3/16/16, 17:18 - Cindy L: That's why BME can do MBBS after
3/16/16, 17:18 - Cindy L: Cuz they hv chem courses esp cellular chem
3/16/16, 17:19 - Mom: oh! that's is why the bbc guy can do med course after ppe
3/16/16, 17:19 - Cindy L: Yea
3/16/16, 17:19 - Mom: he's probably a sci guy at a-level
3/16/16, 17:19 - Mom: and make up some organic chem courses
3/16/16, 17:20 - Cindy L: So med reqs r less stringent
3/16/16, 17:20 - Cindy L: But neuroscience I think I'll go straight up and ask them
3/16/16, 17:20 - Cindy L: I know Cambridge u need a natural science background
3/16/16, 17:20 - Mom: yea
3/16/16, 17:20 - Cindy L: Not sure abt ucl
3/16/16, 17:21 - Mom: natural sci for neuro sci master degree?
3/16/16, 17:21 - Cindy L: Yea
3/16/16, 17:21 - Mom: ic
3/16/16, 17:21 - Cindy L: Cambridge has an undergrad natural sciences degree
3/16/16, 17:21 - Mom: so u just have to check ucl
3/16/16, 17:21 - Cindy L: Yea they asked me for my uni enrollment details today
3/16/16, 17:22 - Mom: what uni enrollment?
3/16/16, 17:22 - Cindy L: Like what unis do u go to now
3/16/16, 17:22 - Mom: haven't u told them?
3/16/16, 17:23 - Cindy L: Well I didbt put it in the weekly newspaper
3/16/16, 17:23 - Cindy L: But duuno
3/16/16, 17:24 - Mom: what r u talking abt? weekly newspaper?
3/16/16, 17:24 - Cindy L: Sory I meant ucas
3/16/16, 17:25 - Cindy L: Dunno why I wrote newspaper
3/16/16, 17:25 - Mom: weird
3/16/16, 17:26 - Cindy L: My BME apps hv largely been ignored
3/16/16, 17:26 - Mom: have u also applied bme in ucl?
3/16/16, 17:26 - Cindy L: I hope I'm first on the wait list
3/16/16, 17:27 - Cindy L: Yea
3/16/16, 17:27 - Mom: now, i thought u shud fill in lse in ur ucas app
3/16/16, 17:28 - Mom: cuz this makes those unis know ur not vacant during these period
3/16/16, 18:26 - Cindy L: But I alreeady submitted so nothing i can do abt it
3/16/16, 18:27 - Mom: I know, I say I thought
3/16/16, 18:27 - Cindy L: Plus doesn't this just mean don't take a gap year
3/16/16, 18:27 - Mom: Yea
3/16/16, 18:28 - Cindy L: And I was gonna do one
3/16/16, 18:28 - Cindy L: Almost
3/16/16, 18:28 - Cindy L: To be fair I would already hv offers so no worries there
3/16/16, 18:29 - Mom: What offer?
3/16/16, 18:31 - Cindy L: Like if I had taken a gap year to rest
3/16/16, 18:33 - Mom: ???
3/16/16, 18:34 - Cindy L: A gap year of rest lol
3/16/16, 18:34 - Cindy L: Whatever nvm, time to camp out in the library
3/16/16, 18:34 - Cindy L: Funny story
3/16/16, 18:35 - Cindy L: I had dinner with my friends yesterday
3/16/16, 18:35 - Cindy L: And we were talking abt how lonely London people were
3/16/16, 18:36 - Cindy L: Cuz we all had experiences where random ppl would just come up to chat with u
3/16/16, 18:36 - Cindy L: Which is very creepy
3/16/16, 18:36 - Cindy L: Hahaha
3/16/16, 18:37 - Mom: This isn't strange thing to me
3/16/16, 18:37 - Mom: I used to hv somebody talked to me
3/16/16, 18:38 - Cindy L: ... Just randomly on the street
3/16/16, 18:38 - Mom: Yea
3/16/16, 18:38 - Cindy L: OK nobody does that these days
3/16/16, 18:38 - Cindy L: And my friend was asked to go have coffee with them
3/16/16, 18:39 - Cindy L: I mean u hv to reach certain levels of loneliness to do that
3/16/16, 18:39 - Mom: Is ur friend a girl?
3/16/16, 18:39 - Cindy L: No
3/16/16, 18:39 - Cindy L: HhahabüòÇ
3/16/16, 18:40 - Mom: I also hv experience of being invited to hv a drink when i'm a teen like 16/7?
3/16/16, 18:42 - Cindy L: .... I mostly ignore anyone who talks to me cuz they r either not nice or crazy
3/16/16, 18:42 - Mom: üòÇ
3/16/16, 18:43 - Cindy L: Fucck I just checked and my email and ucl wants a reference from me. I wanna cry, never gonna check my email again
3/16/16, 18:43 - Mom: What reference? From lse?
3/16/16, 18:44 - Cindy L: Lol yes from my academic advisor
3/16/16, 18:44 - Mom: üò´
3/16/16, 18:44 - Cindy L: Ucl natural sciences is the only one which has replies to my app
3/16/16, 18:45 - Cindy L: BME has largely just ignores my application
3/16/16, 18:45 - Cindy L: Ignored
3/16/16, 18:45 - Mom: Sigh....
3/16/16, 18:45 - Cindy L: Yea
3/16/16, 18:45 - Cindy L: Im in a bit of a pickle right now
3/16/16, 18:46 - Mom: Cuz nobody wud want to change to do natural science degree
3/16/16, 18:46 - Cindy L: It's not actually a natural sci degree
3/16/16, 18:46 - Cindy L: They just call it that so that u can do combined areas of science
3/16/16, 18:46 - Cindy L: Like biomed and whatever
3/16/16, 18:47 - Mom: Ok
3/16/16, 18:47 - Cindy L: I'd imagine u get a degree called biomed and whatever in completion
3/16/16, 18:47 - Cindy L: But yea I'm not gonna switch to just do physics
3/16/16, 18:49 - Cindy L: Super risky to just go and switch to biomed
3/16/16, 18:49 - Mom: ???
3/16/16, 18:52 - Cindy L: Cuz right now I can't opt for biomed
3/16/16, 18:52 - Cindy L: Cuz I hv no chem
3/16/16, 18:52 - Cindy L: But as fter summer hopefully I will have 10 chem credits
3/16/16, 18:53 - Cindy L: And on that basis it's easier to persuade them to let me do the biomed stream
3/16/16, 18:55 - Mom: tty tmr cuz I need to sleep la
3/16/16, 18:55 - Cindy L: OK u do that
3/16/16, 18:55 - Cindy L: Good night
3/17/16, 08:31 - Cindy L: So I tried something interesting this morning
3/17/16, 08:32 - Cindy L: I woke up and then tried to remember what was on the opposite side of the road
3/17/16, 08:32 - Cindy L: My curtains were closed so I couldn't see
3/17/16, 08:33 - Cindy L: I kept thinking of this plaza and cafe....
3/17/16, 08:33 - Cindy L: And it took me like abt 5 mins to remember holborn
3/17/16, 08:34 - Cindy L: and then more thinking til I  remembered Leicester square and soho
3/17/16, 08:35 - Cindy L: But these places only existed in name, still couldn't find where they were or what they looked like in my head....
3/17/16, 08:36 - Cindy L: That cafe keeps coming up in my head....maybe I dreamt of it before.
3/17/16, 08:38 - Cindy L: I thought buildings! Holborn has buildings. Tried to find the buildings around hh in my head
3/17/16, 08:38 - Cindy L: I think it took me a good 5 mins to remember the Travelodge and dominoes
3/17/16, 08:39 - Cindy L: Talk abt being disoriented
3/17/16, 09:18 - Mom: how long u've been sleeping for his block? any dreams therein?
3/17/16, 09:45 - Mom: is this situation happened everytime u woke up?

3/17/16, 09:56 - Mom: no 4am woke up?
3/17/16, 09:56 - Cindy L: But there has been lots of times when i am disoriented when I wake up
3/17/16, 09:56 - Cindy L: Not that I remember lemme check
3/17/16, 09:58 - Mom: i've read research papers that said u woke up disoriented bc ur still in sws sleep
3/17/16, 09:58 - Mom: that means, ur still in the sleeping cycle
3/17/16, 09:59 - Mom: only if u woke up from rem sleep, then u'll be clear-minded
3/17/16, 09:59 - Cindy L: I see
3/17/16, 09:59 - Cindy L: Maybe, in don't really remember dreaming.
3/17/16, 10:00 - Cindy L: Yea there were two moments of arousal I checked.
3/17/16, 10:03 - Mom: so do u think u've sleep enough?
3/17/16, 10:04 - Cindy L: Yea kind of
3/17/16, 10:05 - Cindy L: It was like I floated awake this morning.
3/17/16, 10:05 - Cindy L: Cuz I don't remember coming out of a dream.
3/17/16, 10:06 - Cindy L: If u say it's sws, that's good
3/17/16, 10:25 - Mom: Yea, if u can't the dream, its nrem sleep
3/17/16, 10:43 - Cindy L: But I still had to nap after breakfast
3/17/16, 10:44 - Cindy L: I just napped in squatting position on my desk chair
3/17/16, 10:46 - Mom: long time nap or just short time nap?
3/17/16, 10:52 - Mom: how do u drink the ginseng tea?

3/18/16, 18:02 - Mom: okok, i'll ban DHL forever and forever
3/18/16, 18:02 - Cindy L: Need coffee first
3/18/16, 18:02 - Mom: didn't drink today?
3/18/16, 18:02 - Cindy L: No
3/18/16, 18:03 - Mom: ok, get a cup
3/18/16, 23:57 - Cindy L: <Media omitted>
3/19/16, 00:55 - Mom: sugar is bad bad bad bad...
3/19/16, 00:56 - Mom: better control ur sugar consumption
3/19/16, 11:24 - Cindy L: U hv no comments abt my book though
3/19/16, 11:25 - Emos: noice
3/19/16, 11:25 - Emos: i bought a libro too
3/19/16, 11:30 - Mom: what comment do u want?
3/19/16, 11:54 - Cindy L: Hahaha
3/19/16, 11:55 - Cindy L: Jkjk
3/19/16, 11:55 - Cindy L: Did I mention if I have sweet stuff before bed the hallucinations get really bad
3/19/16, 11:56 - Cindy L: Oh I did, the Ben and Jerry incident
3/19/16, 11:56 - Mom: ofc la
3/19/16, 11:56 - Mom: u ate b&j again
3/19/16, 11:56 - Cindy L: Still wondering why.
3/19/16, 11:56 - Cindy L: No
3/19/16, 11:56 - Cindy L: Not before bed
3/19/16, 11:56 - Mom: cause sugar
3/19/16, 11:57 - Cindy L: I had pancakes the other day and I had hallucinations again.
3/19/16, 11:57 - Cindy L: Actually I'm not sure.
3/19/16, 11:57 - Cindy L: I was pretty scared so I played music and slept with lights on
3/19/16, 11:58 - Mom: but when u ate pancakes here in hk, u didn't hallucinations, right?
3/19/16, 11:58 - Cindy L: In terms of SP: the moment I felt a weight on me I was scared and woke up
3/19/16, 11:58 - Cindy L: U hv to eat it before bed.
3/19/16, 11:58 - Cindy L: Its sugar before sleeping.
3/19/16, 11:59 - Cindy L: Not sugar in general
3/19/16, 11:59 - Cindy L: Anyways
3/19/16, 11:59 - Mom: then don't eat b4 bed la
3/19/16, 11:59 - Cindy L: I was sort of awake around 4
3/19/16, 11:59 - Cindy L: And I kept seeing weird stuff at my door
3/19/16, 12:00 - Cindy L: To be fair, I didn't hv glasses on and I was probably half asleep so it doesn't really count
3/19/16, 12:00 - Mom: then come back hk la, no demons or hallucinations here
3/19/16, 12:01 - Cindy L: Cuz I never have sweet stuff before bed in hk
3/19/16, 12:01 - Cindy L: Now I think abt it.
3/19/16, 12:01 - Mom: don't eat anything b4 bed la, especially sweet stuff
3/19/16, 12:01 - Cindy L: I always had a whole pack of haribos or marshmallows  at night.
3/19/16, 12:01 - Cindy L: Before
3/19/16, 12:02 - Mom: if u rlly have to eat, eat salty stuff
3/19/16, 12:02 - Cindy L: Hmmmmü§î
3/19/16, 12:02 - Cindy L: Uh oh
3/19/16, 12:02 - Mom: rmb that u ate so many haribos and marshmallows here in here back to tsing lung tau time?
3/19/16, 12:02 - Cindy L: Maybe the brain processes sugar differently when asleep
3/19/16, 12:03 - Cindy L: That's what I said.
3/19/16, 12:03 - Mom: what did u see ah this time?
3/19/16, 12:03 - Cindy L: When?
3/19/16, 12:03 - Cindy L: I haven't had sugar since
3/19/16, 12:03 - Cindy L: Pancakes
3/19/16, 12:04 - Mom: u said u saw something at the door
3/19/16, 12:04 - Cindy L: That's on monday
3/19/16, 12:04 - Cindy L: And that was to test if it was really sugar
3/19/16, 12:04 - Cindy L: Many inexplicable things.
3/19/16, 12:04 - Mom: doing research on ur own?
3/19/16, 12:04 - Cindy L: üòî
3/19/16, 12:05 - Cindy L: Being a researcher is like an explorer
3/19/16, 12:05 - Mom: it's too risky to do research with ur own body?
3/19/16, 12:05 - Mom: anyway, u have just one body
3/19/16, 12:06 - Cindy L: Lol I did attempt to find a control subject for my serotonin pills
3/19/16, 12:07 - Cindy L: Hahahaha
3/19/16, 12:07 - Mom: ru still on acetycholine supplements?
3/19/16, 12:07 - Cindy L: Yea cuz apparently they help u burn fat
3/19/16, 12:07 - Cindy L: And it's freezing here
3/19/16, 12:07 - Cindy L: Zomg
3/19/16, 12:07 - Cindy L: It's really really cold
3/19/16, 12:07 - Cindy L: And they turned off the heating
3/19/16, 12:08 - Mom: if that works, i don't think serotonin works for u
3/19/16, 12:08 - Cindy L: Nobody knows how the transmitters work anyways
3/19/16, 12:08 - Mom: it's 8 deg at london
3/19/16, 12:08 - Cindy L: It was 6 yesterday
3/19/16, 12:08 - Cindy L: It's the wind
3/19/16, 12:09 - Mom: ofc we don't know exactly, but we can infer the result
3/19/16, 12:09 - Mom: i saw ur photos taken yesterday, it didn't look so bad
3/19/16, 12:10 - Cindy L: No I meant with transmitters there's so many different way they serve a purpose in the body that when u intake it u don't know what happens to it
3/19/16, 12:10 - Cindy L: Cuz I'm master of lighting
3/19/16, 12:10 - Mom: i mean ur eyes didn't look so tired
3/19/16, 12:11 - Mom: ru pissed today?
3/19/16, 12:11 - Cindy L: At what?
3/19/16, 12:11 - Mom: dhl
3/19/16, 12:12 - Mom: want to boom them/
3/19/16, 12:12 - Cindy L: They don't deliver on weekends
3/19/16, 12:12 - Cindy L: Harharhar
3/19/16, 12:12 - Cindy L: So we take a break
3/19/16, 12:13 - Cindy L: U see what I mean
3/19/16, 12:13 - Mom: but i mean: did they lie?
3/19/16, 12:13 - Cindy L: Yeah I don't know what happened but I haven't found my pack
3/19/16, 12:14 - Mom: cuz they said recipient's premises closed
3/19/16, 12:14 - Mom: so unable to deliver
3/19/16, 12:14 - Cindy L: What
3/19/16, 12:14 - Mom: have u checked the tracking
3/19/16, 12:14 - Cindy L: No
3/19/16, 12:14 - Cindy L: I double checked the address
3/19/16, 12:14 - Cindy L: Before the sent the thing
3/19/16, 12:15 - Cindy L: And they managed to deliver the invoice.
3/19/16, 12:15 - Mom: no, address is correct
3/19/16, 12:15 - Cindy L: Wtf
3/19/16, 12:15 - Cindy L: WTD
3/19/16, 12:15 - Cindy L: WTF
3/19/16, 12:15 - Cindy L: üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•
3/19/16, 12:15 - Cindy L: OK I'm pissed now
3/19/16, 12:15 - Mom: i mean those delivery guys actually forget ur parcel, and just lied and made up excuse on the record
3/19/16, 12:16 - Mom: so, i think u have to email them and complain abt their staff telling lies!!!
3/19/16, 12:16 - Cindy L: I understand the need to gun down some ppl now
3/19/16, 12:17 - Mom: i'm so pissed this morning when i saw their remark
3/19/16, 12:17 - Cindy L: Lol they don't reply to emails at all
3/19/16, 12:17 - Cindy L: I sent one to customer service, she replied a week later
3/19/16, 12:17 - Cindy L: I might as well hv walked to America and retrieved my package myself
3/19/16, 12:17 - Mom: that's uker, hker reply to my email very fast
3/19/16, 12:18 - Mom: brits r so annoying
3/19/16, 12:18 - Cindy L: U see what I mean
3/19/16, 12:19 - Cindy L: They don't work over the weekend
3/19/16, 12:19 - Cindy L: That leaves a really narrow space if time each day from 11-4 to get things done
3/19/16, 12:19 - Cindy L: So things do not get done.
3/19/16, 12:20 - Mom: i can't understand how a country wud survive with these kind of ppl there
3/19/16, 12:20 - Cindy L: Not to mention they also hv to play fake democracy and vote on every single little thing for acting
3/19/16, 12:20 - Mom: ur right
3/19/16, 12:21 - Mom: that's why they rlly need money form china even though they hates chinese so much
3/19/16, 12:22 - Cindy L: Their industrial economy is apparently 30 years behind
3/19/16, 12:22 - Mom: hahaha
3/19/16, 12:23 - Mom: that's true
3/19/16, 12:23 - Cindy L: My flat mate has great plans for britain
3/19/16, 12:24 - Cindy L: Lol
3/19/16, 12:24 - Mom: what plan?
3/19/16, 12:24 - Mom: to boom uk?
3/19/16, 12:59 - Cindy L: Lol for UK industry
3/19/16, 22:37 - Cindy L: Zomg
3/19/16, 22:37 - Cindy L: I started reading the book
3/19/16, 22:37 - Cindy L: Very interesting things.
3/19/16, 22:37 - Cindy L: Discovered something called the vagus nerve which connects to the hypothalamus
3/19/16, 22:38 - Cindy L: To the GI
3/19/16, 22:38 - Cindy L: Which possibly explains why food affects my symptoms so much
3/19/16, 22:39 - Cindy L: Bad news is that it maybe impossible for me to lose weight unless I get hormone therapy
3/19/16, 23:33 - Cindy L: I'm so cold
3/19/16, 23:33 - Cindy L: As well
3/20/16, 02:44 - Mom: u have tested the vagus nerve already at the st. teresa hospital, the tilt table test
3/20/16, 02:44 - Mom: no heating at dorm?
3/20/16, 08:47 - Cindy L: Oh really
3/20/16, 08:47 - Cindy L: That was the vagus nerve test?
3/20/16, 08:48 - Cindy L: That is really strange then.
3/20/16, 13:13 - Cindy L: Cuz it controls a bunch of muscles which seem to correspond to the weakness I experience during catapexy
3/20/16, 13:14 - Cindy L: Which are in the back of the throat affecting breathing and swallowing. And possibly the slacking of the jaw
3/20/16, 13:14 - Cindy L: I also can't speak
3/20/16, 13:14 - Mom: can't speak?
3/20/16, 13:14 - Mom: now?
3/20/16, 13:15 - Cindy L: No I meant during cataplexy
3/20/16, 13:15 - Cindy L: Im still on the muscles
3/20/16, 13:15 - Mom: but why when u try breathing heavily, then u can't counteract that cataplexy?
3/20/16, 13:16 - Cindy L: Yah it controls one of the muscles related to breathing as well
3/20/16, 13:16 - Cindy L: Yah only one
3/20/16, 13:17 - Cindy L: When I control breathing I must be trying to regain control of that muscle
3/20/16, 13:18 - Cindy L: The vagus also lowers heart rate which can cause low blood pressure
3/20/16, 13:18 - Cindy L: This i find convincing cuz I always get that fainting like feeling in my head which I can describe
3/20/16, 13:19 - Cindy L: And sometimes when I get repeated episodes, I pound on my chest and it feels a bit better?
3/20/16, 13:20 - Cindy L: Need to look into what the tilt table test actually tests for
3/20/16, 13:20 - Cindy L: Cuz I thought it was a cardiac thing.
3/20/16, 13:22 - Mom: the tilt test showed changes of ur blood pressure at different position, ofc it relates to ur cardiac function
3/20/16, 13:23 - Cindy L: Yea but how does that relate to the vagus nerve
3/20/16, 13:23 - Cindy L: I saw on Wikipedia that there is research into stimulation of the vagus to counter epileptic seizures
3/20/16, 13:25 - Mom: A tilt table test is considered positive if the patient experiences symptoms associated with a drop in blood pressure or cardiac arrhythmia
3/20/16, 13:26 - Cindy L: I ser
3/20/16, 13:26 - Cindy L: I see
3/20/16, 13:27 - Mom: Dysautonomia is a general term used to describe a breakdown, or failure of the autonomic nervous system. The autonomic nervous system controls much of your involuntary functions. Symptoms are wide ranging and can include problems with the regulation of heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature and perspiration
3/20/16, 13:28 - Mom: tilt table test is to test unexplained syncope and dysautomonia
3/20/16, 14:46 - Cindy L: Its not the ans
3/20/16, 14:46 - Cindy L: The ans is fine
3/20/16, 14:46 - Cindy L: It's the sns and pns
3/20/16, 14:47 - Cindy L: Well
3/20/16, 14:47 - Cindy L: So it could still be the vagus
3/20/16, 15:03 - Mom: ur vagus nerve is fine
3/20/16, 15:04 - Mom: cuz that's for transmitting nerve impulse
3/20/16, 15:04 - Mom: just don't know what's wrong?
3/20/16, 15:39 - Mom: think carefully, it shud be the conversion of sugar having prob?
3/20/16, 15:41 - Mom: u hv to nap/sleep every time after bkf/lunch, isn't it the prob with sugar conversion?
3/20/16, 17:04 - Cindy L: What u mean the metabolism of sugar?
3/20/16, 17:04 - Cindy L: I dont think so
3/20/16, 17:06 - Cindy L: <Media omitted>
3/20/16, 17:08 - Cindy L: This doctor is a great writer.
3/20/16, 17:11 - Mom: not the metabolism of sugar
3/20/16, 17:12 - Cindy L: So there r things called epigenes
3/20/16, 17:13 - Cindy L: Which control the expression of genes
3/20/16, 17:13 - Cindy L: That could possibly be what happened to me.
3/20/16, 17:14 - Mom: don't think it relates to gene prob
3/20/16, 17:18 - Cindy L: I think everything I have is most likely to be genetics bro
3/20/16, 17:19 - Mom: wow, it's rlly difficult to identify which gene having that kind of prob
3/20/16, 17:20 - Mom: if that's the genetic prob, u shud have an earlier onset of the disorder
3/20/16, 17:22 - Cindy L: But epigenes bro
3/20/16, 17:23 - Cindy L: Epigenes can change and if they so they control which parts of the DNA is active in cells
3/20/16, 17:24 - Cindy L: They can change due to diet and stress.
3/20/16, 17:24 - Cindy L: ....ü§î
3/20/16, 17:25 - Mom: do u rlly think that ur stress level was that great that makes u unbearable at ur ib yrs?
3/20/16, 17:25 - Mom: i rlly don't think so
3/20/16, 17:25 - Mom: i wud guess it's the sugar prob
3/20/16, 17:26 - Cindy L: I think I was under significant stress during that time, so I think it was definitely a factor.
3/20/16, 17:26 - Cindy L: And also the gallons of sugar I ate.
3/20/16, 17:27 - Mom: u have stress but is the magnitude that great enough to cause a mutation?
3/20/16, 17:27 - Mom: nvm, just think again
3/20/16, 17:27 - Cindy L: It's not a mutation
3/20/16, 17:27 - Mom: ü§î
3/20/16, 17:28 - Cindy L: It's a change in the expression of my already existing genotype
3/20/16, 17:28 - Cindy L: Google epigenes and watch the university of Utah video, it very clear and helpful
3/20/16, 17:28 - Mom: that mean it's an autonomous disorder?
3/20/16, 17:29 - Cindy L: ... Don't get the question?
3/20/16, 17:29 - Cindy L: I thought it was widely accepted that narco-cataplexy is an autonomous disorder
3/20/16, 17:30 - Cindy L: Sorry autoimmune
3/20/16, 17:31 - Mom: ei ya, i was wondering how u could cope with ur gov't & econ coursework?
3/20/16, 17:31 - Mom: u have spent all ur time reading materials abt the brain
3/20/16, 17:32 - Mom: watch out for the grades!!
3/20/16, 17:33 - Mom: i'll google the epigenes again tmr morning cuz it's 1:33 AM here in hk
3/20/16, 17:33 - Mom: got to sleep la
3/20/16, 17:38 - Cindy L: I'm first yr, it's fine
3/20/16, 17:38 - Mom: great
3/20/16, 17:39 - Cindy L: <Media omitted>
3/20/16, 17:41 - Mom: have u read something in the brain like insulin, i guess that might be one of the reason for ur urge to sleep after meals
3/20/16, 17:46 - Cindy L: <Media omitted>
3/20/16, 17:47 - Cindy L: Orexigensis controls energy usage
3/20/16, 17:47 - Cindy L: Pretty likely that's the reason I go to sleep after meal
3/20/16, 17:48 - Cindy L: Meal would contain sugars, secrete of insulin would trigger energy storage mode.
3/20/16, 17:48 - Cindy L: Aka sleep
3/20/16, 21:11 - Cindy L: http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/epigenetics/brain/
3/20/16, 21:16 - Cindy L: omg
3/20/16, 21:16 - Cindy L: http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/epigenetics/rats/
3/20/16, 21:17 - Cindy L: this maybe why i'm super anxious
3/20/16, 23:33 - Mom: even ur hypothesis is correct, but how do u know which component in this process goes wrong?
3/21/16, 03:28 - Mom: dropped off the CQ at kgv career office this morning
3/21/16, 07:25 - Cindy L: Tyty
3/21/16, 07:26 - Cindy L: Did u give it to berina?
3/21/16, 07:26 - Mom: don't know who she is?
3/21/16, 07:26 - Mom: but she seems to have communicate with u b4
3/21/16, 07:27 - Cindy L: üëç
3/21/16, 07:28 - Cindy L: The girl
3/21/16, 07:28 - Cindy L: OK so NW is mostly done
3/21/16, 07:29 - Mom: is she berina?
3/21/16, 07:30 - Cindy L: Yah
3/21/16, 07:31 - Cindy L: Just to get my adviser to sign the college report
3/21/16, 07:32 - Cindy L: Shit
3/21/16, 07:32 - Cindy L: Now to deal with ucl
3/21/16, 07:32 - Cindy L: They also want a freaking ref
3/21/16, 07:32 - Mom: so many works to do
3/21/16, 07:32 - Cindy L: Should I bombard my adviser with it
3/21/16, 07:33 - Cindy L: Hmm üò£
3/21/16, 07:33 - Mom: if not, who's going to write it for u?
3/21/16, 07:33 - Cindy L: Or ask a class teacher.
3/21/16, 07:33 - Mom: that's great
3/21/16, 07:33 - Cindy L: I was planning to ask a class teacher at least I've done some work for her...
3/21/16, 07:33 - Mom: then ask a class teacher provided that u didn't sleep at his/her class
3/21/16, 07:34 - Cindy L: But I don't know if she'll do it, cuz lse policy is that refs r written by advisers
3/21/16, 07:34 - Mom: oh rlly
3/21/16, 07:34 - Cindy L: Yh
3/21/16, 07:34 - Mom: pretend not knowing this la
3/21/16, 07:34 - Cindy L: Lol
3/21/16, 07:34 - Cindy L: And then
3/21/16, 07:34 - Cindy L: There's the issue of which stream to apply for
3/21/16, 07:35 - Cindy L: Cuz only Nat sci has replied to any of my ucas apps
3/21/16, 07:35 - Mom: if ur not goint to biomed/neurosci, why go to natural sci?
3/21/16, 07:35 - Cindy L: Because u can take biomed through Nat sci
3/21/16, 07:36 - Mom: so obvious that u have to opt for biomed la
3/21/16, 07:37 - Cindy L: No but u need chem as pre req
3/21/16, 07:37 - Cindy L: Right now I do not hv chem
3/21/16, 07:37 - Mom: if ur going to just physics/earth sci, why the hell u want to change major?
3/21/16, 07:38 - Mom: will they accept changing major in the middle of the term yr?
3/21/16, 07:38 - Mom: this is an issue
3/21/16, 07:38 - Cindy L: Cuz after summer I should get my credits
3/21/16, 07:38 - Cindy L: If ucb goes smoothly
3/21/16, 07:39 - Cindy L: Then u can switch within two weeks I think
3/21/16, 07:39 - Cindy L: And they say the stream u choose now is tentative
3/21/16, 07:39 - Emos: elo folks
3/21/16, 07:40 - Cindy L: But I don't know how firm of a choice it is and I can't exactly ask
3/21/16, 07:40 - Emos: i did my chem test
3/21/16, 07:40 - Mom: if ucl give an offer, do they need deposit payment b4 term starts?
3/21/16, 07:40 - Cindy L: Not sure, should be same as lse
3/21/16, 07:40 - Cindy L: Cool
3/21/16, 07:40 - Mom: so no payment?
3/21/16, 07:40 - Mom: then it wudn't be a pro
3/21/16, 07:40 - Mom: prob
3/21/16, 07:41 - Cindy L: Er... What if they don't let u switc
3/21/16, 07:41 - Cindy L: That's a prob
3/21/16, 07:41 - Mom: but even if u did ucb's chem course, is it enough to apply to biomed?
3/21/16, 07:42 - Cindy L: Yea I snooped around biomed
3/21/16, 07:42 - Mom: yea, if not allow switch between stream, then it wud be a prob
3/21/16, 07:42 - Cindy L: Basically there's a course where u do ib chem again
3/21/16, 07:42 - Mom: where?
3/21/16, 07:42 - Cindy L: At UCL first yr
3/21/16, 07:42 - Mom: ic
3/21/16, 07:43 - Cindy L: So she said even if I hadn't done chem at a lvl I will manage
3/21/16, 07:43 - Cindy L: Anyways but that's in reality
3/21/16, 07:44 - Mom: then (1) deal with the ref first, (2) try to communicate with ucl if u can opt for biomed if they're going to give u an offer
3/21/16, 07:44 - Mom: if not, nothing can do
3/21/16, 07:45 - Cindy L: I was wondering if I should submit an additional statement of transfer
3/21/16, 07:45 - Mom: what is it?
3/21/16, 07:45 - Mom: to ucl?
3/21/16, 07:45 - Cindy L: What I wrote for common app basically
3/21/16, 07:45 - Mom: to where?
3/21/16, 07:45 - Cindy L: Like why u trsf
3/21/16, 07:46 - Mom: do they require it?
3/21/16, 07:46 - Cindy L: No
3/21/16, 07:46 - Mom: then don't bother
3/21/16, 07:47 - Cindy L: But I can legitimately apply for biomed right now if I do so
3/21/16, 07:47 - Mom: can u do that now?
3/21/16, 07:47 - Cindy L: Plus all I've submitted right now is the design eng one.
3/21/16, 07:47 - Cindy L: Do what? Choose biomed stream?
3/21/16, 07:47 - Mom: who ask for a ref?
3/21/16, 07:47 - Cindy L: UCL
3/21/16, 07:48 - Mom: i mean which dept?
3/21/16, 07:48 - Cindy L: Admissions
3/21/16, 07:48 - Cindy L: Cuz they knew I was trsf
3/21/16, 07:48 - Cindy L: So they didn't accept HS stuff
3/21/16, 07:49 - Mom: they already knew u was trf, then why bother to apply trf to biomed again?
3/21/16, 07:49 - Mom: what's HS?
3/21/16, 07:49 - Cindy L: High school
3/21/16, 07:49 - Cindy L: Noooo
3/21/16, 07:49 - Cindy L: U confused
3/21/16, 07:49 - Cindy L: https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mathematical-physical-sciences/natural-sciences/core-streams/stream-combinations
3/21/16, 07:49 - Cindy L: Read thus
3/21/16, 07:50 - Mom: what?
3/21/16, 07:51 - Mom: i read that website b4
3/21/16, 07:51 - Mom: so?
3/21/16, 07:53 - Cindy L: Yes u see how u can choose stream √ßombinations through Nat sci
3/21/16, 07:53 - Cindy L: I wasn't talking abt applying for a biomed degree.
3/21/16, 07:54 - Cindy L: Or transferring to biomed dept
3/21/16, 07:54 - Cindy L: I was talking abt changing streams
3/21/16, 07:54 - Cindy L: Because choice of stream will affect whether I get an offer or not.
3/21/16, 07:57 - Mom: u don't even meet the requirement of biomed stream, how wud they consider ur case?
3/21/16, 07:58 - Mom: but if u can't do biomed stream, there's no point to go to ucl
3/21/16, 10:11 - Cindy L: Yes I know
3/21/16, 10:11 - Cindy L: Nvm
3/21/16, 10:11 - Cindy L: I'll just sort it out myself
3/21/16, 10:12 - Mom: ok
3/21/16, 10:12 - Mom: best of luck
3/21/16, 10:13 - Cindy L: I'm gonna spend the whole day angsting abt it again.
3/21/16, 10:14 - Mom: take it easy la
3/21/16, 10:15 - Cindy L: Some things u make the wrong decision it's gone
3/21/16, 10:16 - Mom: btw, u still can finish ur deg now and take some make-up chem courses and apply to medical school again after lse, right?
3/21/16, 10:16 - Mom: like the bbc guy
3/21/16, 10:16 - Cindy L: Given that u get a 2:1
3/21/16, 10:17 - Cindy L: At least a 2:1
3/21/16, 10:17 - Mom: that's not too difficult, i think
3/21/16, 10:17 - Cindy L: And there isn't any make up chem courses here
3/21/16, 10:18 - Cindy L: I don't want to go to med schl
3/21/16, 10:18 - Mom: tbh, if u picked ucsd in the first place, things wud be much more easy cuz u can change major in an all round uni, instead of now being in lse which is only specialise in soci sci
3/21/16, 10:18 - Cindy L: Ik
3/21/16, 10:18 - Cindy L: Which means u need to make the right decision
3/21/16, 10:18 - Cindy L: Well at least I need to
3/21/16, 10:18 - Mom: but there shud be some make up chem courses in other unis, right?
3/21/16, 10:19 - Mom: nvm la, there must be ways to do the correction
3/21/16, 10:20 - Cindy L: that's so far in the future I don't see the point in planning
3/21/16, 10:20 - Cindy L: For it
3/21/16, 10:20 - Mom: no, can't agree with you
3/21/16, 10:21 - Mom: you just have make ur plans too narrow
3/21/16, 10:21 - Mom: rmb that u didn't even thought of doing sci in uni, right?
3/21/16, 10:22 - Mom: u have applied for most of the humanity courses
3/21/16, 10:22 - Cindy L: Well cuz I hv to worrying abt things like should I eat breakfast today which might make me sleep for the next four hrs in the library
3/21/16, 10:22 - Mom: like IR, PPE, architecture
3/21/16, 10:23 - Mom: worrying abt those things won't help in correcting ur choice
3/21/16, 10:23 - Mom: so why worrying then?
3/21/16, 10:23 - Mom: which makes u more anxious
3/21/16, 10:23 - Cindy L: Cuz I hv an essay due in twoo days
3/21/16, 10:23 - Mom: go do it then
3/21/16, 10:24 - Mom: will u fall asleep easily when u were browsing the websites for neurosci thingy?
3/21/16, 10:24 - Cindy L: No
3/21/16, 10:24 - Cindy L: I'm reading books
3/21/16, 10:24 - Mom: so, this is the point
3/21/16, 10:25 - Cindy L: Yes this is the point
3/21/16, 10:26 - Cindy L: That's why I must change
3/21/16, 10:26 - Mom: whenever u don't want or hates something, u unconsciously deny every aspect of that thing, so.....
3/21/16, 10:26 - Cindy L: I don't hate it.
3/21/16, 10:26 - Cindy L: It's just not relevant to me anymore.
3/21/16, 10:26 - Cindy L: I even fall asleep doing math
3/21/16, 10:26 - Cindy L: Still
3/21/16, 10:26 - Mom: yea, u do
3/21/16, 10:26 - Cindy L: Nothing is relevant to me anymore
3/21/16, 10:27 - Cindy L: That's why I stopped watching the news
3/21/16, 10:27 - Mom: if nothing is relevant, then why bother to do neurosci?
3/21/16, 10:27 - Cindy L: Except for neurosci
3/21/16, 10:27 - Cindy L: And this area of bioscience
3/21/16, 10:28 - Mom: u can't be that
3/21/16, 10:28 - Mom: it just hinder ur way out
3/21/16, 10:29 - Cindy L: What do u mean
3/21/16, 10:30 - Cindy L: For once I feel good cuz I don't hv to worry abt what everyone else is doing and what I subject I want to do and how I am doing in relation to them, for once I hv focus.
3/21/16, 10:30 - Cindy L: And that is great.
3/21/16, 10:31 - Mom: nvm
3/21/16, 10:31 - Mom: do ur work, okay?
3/21/16, 10:48 - Cindy L: I bought a book abt anxiety as well
3/21/16, 10:49 - Cindy L: So far it has not been helping..
3/21/16, 10:49 - Mom: don't read those book la, do ur coursework first, pls
3/21/16, 10:49 - Cindy L: Lol
3/21/16, 10:49 - Cindy L: If I manage to decide to hv breakfast or not and then where.
3/21/16, 10:50 - Mom: don't eat bkf
3/21/16, 10:50 - Cindy L: Kk
3/21/16, 10:50 - Mom: just finish ur work and don't think of any other things
3/21/16, 10:51 - Cindy L: Dw I give myself 10 hrs
3/21/16, 10:51 - Cindy L: Plus I'm going to the lib
3/21/16, 10:51 - Mom: 10 hrs for what?
3/21/16, 10:51 - Cindy L: To finish the thing
3/21/16, 10:52 - Mom: finish ur coursework?
3/21/16, 10:52 - Cindy L: Yea
3/21/16, 10:52 - Mom: why don't do it now? and let the rest time do other things?
3/21/16, 10:52 - Mom: don't just try to rush for deadline
3/21/16, 10:52 - Mom: it's not healthy
3/21/16, 10:52 - Cindy L: Er I'm getting ready to go to the lib?
3/21/16, 10:53 - Mom: why go to lib?
3/21/16, 10:53 - Cindy L: I just got up half an hr ago
3/21/16, 10:53 - Mom: can't do ur work at ur dorm?
3/21/16, 10:53 - Cindy L: Cuz they hv better chairs
3/21/16, 10:53 - Mom: better for sleeping?
3/21/16, 10:53 - Mom: u told me that u have invented new ways to keep u work
3/21/16, 10:53 - Mom: the standing desk, right?
3/21/16, 10:54 - Mom: if desk is an important factor in one's life, then i have nothing to say
3/21/16, 10:54 - Mom: how many hours u slept last night?
3/21/16, 10:54 - Cindy L: Lol one of the provlems of my room is that ratio of the height of the desk and chair is not right
3/21/16, 10:55 - Mom: 10 hrs?
3/21/16, 10:55 - Cindy L: Yah
3/21/16, 10:55 - Cindy L: If I don't reply on WhatsApp I'm sleeping.
3/21/16, 10:56 - Mom: u know u have coursework to submit in 2 days' time, and u still bother to read other stuff
3/21/16, 10:56 - Mom: ur just being controlled by ur emotion
3/21/16, 10:56 - Mom: and u let those things happened
3/21/16, 10:57 - Mom: come back to hk during ur spring break
3/21/16, 10:57 - Mom: otherwise i don't thing u wud do ur revision during that time
3/21/16, 10:58 - Cindy L: Lololol no it's called procrastination, it's why people go on fb and YouTube at work
3/21/16, 10:58 - Cindy L: That's why I'm going to the library
3/21/16, 10:58 - Mom: ur wasting ur own time
3/21/16, 10:59 - Mom: ur still in the high school mood
3/21/16, 10:59 - Mom: just thinking of new and funny things
3/21/16, 11:00 - Cindy L: .....
3/21/16, 11:01 - Cindy L: U do realize I'm not just sitting here chatting to u.
3/21/16, 11:01 - Mom: did u wake up last night at 4?
3/21/16, 11:01 - Mom: btw, have u call dhl or redelivery?
3/21/16, 11:02 - Cindy L: No I hv 99 problems and dhl ain't one of them
3/21/16, 11:03 - Mom: okay, i don't mind, it's just trivial money
3/21/16, 11:03 - Mom: i'll order another and have it send to ur dorm again, but no dhl this time
3/21/16, 11:05 - Cindy L: I saw at the Korean shop
3/21/16, 11:05 - Cindy L: They sold red ginseng concentrate for 20pp
3/21/16, 11:07 - Cindy L: Dude
3/21/16, 11:07 - Cindy L: Stop ordering!!!
3/21/16, 11:09 - Mom: k
3/21/16, 11:43 - Cindy L: They sell red ginseng concentrate for 20pp
3/21/16, 11:43 - Cindy L: Is that cheaper?
3/21/16, 11:43 - Cindy L: I don't know where it is made in though
3/21/16, 13:04 - Mom: not made in korea?
3/21/16, 13:05 - Mom: its depends on the quantity as well
3/21/16, 13:05 - Mom: 20pp for how much oz/ml?
3/21/16, 13:06 - Mom: and red ginseng is different from white ginseng
3/21/16, 13:07 - Cindy L: Oh
3/21/16, 13:07 - Cindy L: I saw it in a box of similar size, assumed it was the same thing.
3/21/16, 13:07 - Cindy L: I'll check again later today
3/21/16, 13:09 - Mom: btw, u still have to claim the parcel back from dhl cuz we have already paid for it
3/21/16, 13:13 - Cindy L: Can u check tracking
3/21/16, 13:13 - Mom: checked already
3/21/16, 13:13 - Cindy L: Where is i
3/21/16, 13:13 - Cindy L: It
3/21/16, 13:13 - Mom: they're waiting for next schedule
3/21/16, 13:14 - Mom: that means u have to call them for delivery
3/21/16, 13:14 - Mom: better just ask them to deliver asap to get the things settle down
3/21/16, 13:15 - Mom: and ban dhl uk forever and ever
3/21/16, 13:15 - Mom: u don't have enough time and energy to deal with those rubbish
3/21/16, 13:15 - Cindy L: I hv no time to do so right now
3/21/16, 13:16 - Cindy L: I'll do it on Wednesday or Thursday
3/21/16, 13:17 - Mom: just make a call, if u do it on wed or thur, it's coming easter holiday, think of the case if they default it again?
3/21/16, 13:17 - Mom: then the parcel lies there forever and ever
3/21/16, 14:46 - Cindy L: I hv no credit
3/21/16, 14:47 - Mom: get a payphone
3/21/16, 14:47 - Mom: or borrow someone
3/21/16, 14:47 - Mom: someone's mobile?
3/21/16, 14:47 - Cindy L: Kk
3/21/16, 14:47 - Cindy L: When I get round to it
3/21/16, 14:48 - Mom: ty
3/21/16, 18:15 - Cindy L: OK it's definitely sugar which makes me sleep
3/21/16, 18:15 - Cindy L: Interesting.
3/21/16, 18:15 - Mom: Ok
3/21/16, 18:15 - Mom: So no more sugsrt
3/21/16, 18:15 - Cindy L: I'm testing the threshold too
3/21/16, 18:16 - Cindy L: I just had 7 g and it still put me to slrep
3/21/16, 18:16 - Cindy L: Sleep
3/21/16, 18:16 - Mom: I'm wondering if sugar is the cause for ur disorder
3/21/16, 18:16 - Cindy L: Probably
3/21/16, 18:17 - Cindy L: But that is really scary
3/21/16, 18:17 - Cindy L: But considering all that sugar I ate, it is surprising I don't hv diabetes already
3/21/16, 18:17 - Mom: Yea
3/21/16, 18:18 - Cindy L: Which is why initially I was looking into metabolic syndrome
3/21/16, 18:18 - Cindy L: And I suspected I maybe hyperinsulemic
3/21/16, 18:18 - Mom: My big sister has diabetes which is caused by taking in too much sugar
3/21/16, 18:18 - Cindy L: Hyperinsulemic
3/21/16, 18:18 - Cindy L: Yea type 2
3/21/16, 18:18 - Cindy L: It's super common now
3/21/16, 18:19 - Cindy L: That's causes obesity as well
3/21/16, 18:19 - Mom: So,u need to cut off all those harbros & marshmallow
3/21/16, 18:19 - Cindy L: I already did
3/21/16, 18:20 - Cindy L: üòë
3/21/16, 18:20 - Mom: üëç
3/21/16, 18:20 - Cindy L: I suspect sugar may hv affected my epigenes
3/21/16, 18:20 - Cindy L: Which is highly possible
3/21/16, 18:21 - Mom: But epigenes is reversible
3/21/16, 18:21 - Cindy L: That's true
3/21/16, 18:22 - Cindy L: Sorry I meant insulin resistant
3/21/16, 18:22 - Cindy L: Before
3/21/16, 18:22 - Mom: Have u call dhl ah? Faster, it's going to holiday soon
3/21/16, 18:22 - Cindy L: I must be insulin resistant
3/21/16, 18:22 - Cindy L: I just finished a good chunk of my essay
3/21/16, 18:23 - Mom: Lemme chk the brain insulin tmr
3/21/16, 18:23 - Mom: I suspect ur brain insulin mechanism is having prob
3/21/16, 18:23 - Cindy L: Kk
3/22/16, 13:17 - Cindy L: I think ive solved the mystery of my sudden weight increase
3/22/16, 13:18 - Cindy L: Its highly likely to be metabolic syndrome
3/22/16, 13:19 - Cindy L: Concerning why dieting didn't work
3/22/16, 13:19 - Cindy L: It's cuz I'm supposed to eat carbs and fat separately
3/22/16, 13:20 - Cindy L: Because the liver metabolises them differently
3/22/16, 13:21 - Cindy L: And concerning how much glucose is actually used for metabolism, it is astonishingly little.
3/22/16, 13:21 - Cindy L: For 120 calories of glucose, only 24 is used as energy and the rest is stored as glycogen
3/22/16, 13:21 - Cindy L: Wtf
3/22/16, 13:21 - Cindy L: That's only half a bowl of rice
3/22/16, 13:22 - Cindy L: So haribos and marshmallows is like big projects for the liver
3/22/16, 13:24 - Cindy L: So basically the energy furnaces in my liver had a serious meltdown
3/22/16, 13:25 - Cindy L: Which explains why my face was yellow for a while.
3/22/16, 13:25 - Cindy L: Also concerning why I don't get a dopamine high from exercise
3/22/16, 13:26 - Cindy L: That's probably cuz a lot of my d2 receptors hv disappeared cuz of my various addictions...
3/22/16, 13:27 - Cindy L: In retrospect I guess it was right to go to an endocrinologist, but we went to a shitty one.
3/22/16, 13:34 - Cindy L: Just saying I think that is also what happened with ur weight gain cuz u mentioned that u drank a lot of coke at one point.
3/22/16, 13:34 - Cindy L: üò≠
3/22/16, 13:36 - Cindy L: Why sugar triggered narcoleptic symptoms in my case is still a mystery...
3/22/16, 13:40 - Mom: but i didn't have yellow face
3/22/16, 13:41 - Mom: so u've determined to cut off all haribos and marshmallows
3/22/16, 14:46 - Cindy L: üòë I've determined to cut off sugar.
3/22/16, 14:46 - Cindy L: Unfortunately everything has sugar
3/22/16, 14:46 - Cindy L: So I'm terrified of eating anything now.
3/22/16, 14:47 - Mom: cut off added sugar wud be good enough
3/22/16, 14:47 - Mom: eat asian food with spice and salt
3/22/16, 14:48 - Mom: wud that be better?
3/22/16, 14:48 - Cindy L: No
3/22/16, 14:48 - Cindy L: Rice has sugar.
3/22/16, 14:48 - Cindy L: I don't know
3/22/16, 14:48 - Cindy L: I stopped drinking juice for sure
3/22/16, 14:48 - Mom: what abt potato?
3/22/16, 14:48 - Cindy L: And then I don't know what to do abt my noodles.
3/22/16, 14:49 - Cindy L: Potato is all carb
3/22/16, 14:49 - Cindy L: Fruit is bad too
3/22/16, 14:49 - Cindy L: If I just eat meat I'm gonna get cancer.
3/22/16, 14:51 - Mom: but u can eat less with potatoes cuz they fill up ur stomach quickly

3/22/16, 16:52 - Mom: drink green tea or water
3/22/16, 16:52 - Cindy L: Haven't u read what I wrote
3/22/16, 16:52 - Cindy L: U can't metabolise glucose and fat at the same time.
3/22/16, 16:53 - Mom: okay, take away rice
3/22/16, 16:54 - Mom: veggie/egg/lean meat no carb
3/22/16, 16:55 - Cindy L: That's so many elements to cook
3/22/16, 16:56 - Cindy L: I've been have soba and two crab sticks for the past two weeks
3/22/16, 16:56 - Mom: u just need to cook meat and fry egg
3/22/16, 16:56 - Mom: veggie don't need to cook
3/22/16, 16:56 - Cindy L: Anyways
3/22/16, 16:56 - Mom: so is ur soba noodle + crab sticks good?
3/22/16, 16:58 - Mom: btw those crab sticks aren't rlly good food
3/22/16, 16:59 - Mom: why don't u eat beans which contain vit. b
3/22/16, 16:59 - Mom: vit. b is good for relieving stress
3/22/16, 17:00 - Mom: and repairing ur nerve
3/22/16, 17:08 - Cindy L: ....
3/22/16, 17:09 - Cindy L: The crab sticks is minced fish
3/22/16, 17:09 - Cindy L: Anyways
3/22/16, 17:10 - Cindy L: Should I go for the biomed and med physics stream
3/22/16, 17:10 - Mom: med physics? study what/
3/22/16, 17:10 - Cindy L: Like med machinese
3/22/16, 17:10 - Cindy L: Machines
3/22/16, 17:11 - Cindy L: MRI machines how they work
3/22/16, 17:11 - Cindy L: Or should I choose a stream I'm eligible for right now
3/22/16, 17:11 - Mom: what wud do expect for a job of this skill?
3/22/16, 17:12 - Cindy L: It's biomed and med physics
3/22/16, 17:12 - Cindy L: The question is the biomed part anyways
3/22/16, 17:12 - Mom: i mean learning how to make or operate mri
3/22/16, 17:12 - Cindy L: It doesn't matter
3/22/16, 17:13 - Mom: so what abt that for the biomed?
3/22/16, 17:13 - Cindy L: Hv u read the course pagr
3/22/16, 17:13 - Cindy L: U need to choose a combo of two streams
3/22/16, 17:13 - Mom: don't ask such silly Q
3/22/16, 17:13 - Mom: ofc i know
3/22/16, 17:14 - Cindy L: The question is Im not eligible for all the health related streams right now cuz I don't hv chem.
3/22/16, 17:14 - Cindy L: But I don't know if I whether they will just let me switch that easily after the summer
3/22/16, 17:15 - Cindy L: And I need to choose a stream to apply to right now
3/22/16, 17:15 - Mom: solution: (1) to choose the streams which ur eligible to appy
3/22/16, 17:16 - Mom: (2) to do extra summer chem course in order to request a change of stream by the start of the term yr
3/22/16, 17:17 - Mom: (3) if option 2 is denied, what contingency plan?
3/22/16, 17:17 - Cindy L: Yes exactly
3/22/16, 17:17 - Cindy L: And if I do that they ll be like this person is super sneaky
3/22/16, 17:18 - Mom: or (4) ask ucl beforehand if they allow u to appy chem + ... now, but i guess the chance of being admitted is remote
3/22/16, 17:18 - Cindy L: I thought abt possibly laying down my situation and see if they let me bypass chem requirement if I tell them I enrolled in summer courses
3/22/16, 17:18 - Cindy L: Yeah no.4
3/22/16, 17:19 - Mom: why wud they specially make u this allowance?
3/22/16, 17:19 - Cindy L: Erm cuz I have ambition
3/22/16, 17:19 - Cindy L: Lol
3/22/16, 17:19 - Cindy L: That's a good point
3/22/16, 17:20 - Cindy L: How many people hv ambition
3/22/16, 17:21 - Mom: normally, this kind of organisation won't make such a generous commitment to someone they don't even understand well, in terms of both academically or whatever....
3/22/16, 17:21 - Cindy L: Lol OK I see ur point
3/22/16, 17:22 - Mom: unless, u have lots of evidence to prove to them that ur special like gifted or whatever
3/22/16, 17:22 - Cindy L: So I need to offer to donate my brain
3/22/16, 17:22 - Mom: so my advice is don't tell them ur plan before they make u an offer
3/22/16, 17:23 - Cindy L: Hmm
3/22/16, 17:23 - Cindy L: Fair point
3/22/16, 17:23 - Mom: don't think that ur rlly special, there're lots of weird incidents in uk
3/22/16, 17:23 - Cindy L: It's also the mathematics and physics office of admission
3/22/16, 17:24 - Cindy L: My case is pretty aberrant
3/22/16, 17:24 - Cindy L: I'm not so sure if I had narco originally.
3/22/16, 17:24 - Cindy L: I though I did like see a creepy girl next to my bed last night so that convinces me.
3/22/16, 17:25 - Mom: u know ppl used to do just normal and routine work, not special work which requires lots of explanations and justifications
3/22/16, 17:25 - Mom: in the real world, pp used to avoid these situations
3/22/16, 17:25 - Cindy L: Okay
3/22/16, 17:26 - Cindy L: But they r researcher right
3/22/16, 17:26 - Mom: what creepy girl?
3/22/16, 17:26 - Cindy L: Hallucinations
3/22/16, 17:26 - Cindy L: For some reason I see females a lot
3/22/16, 17:26 - Cindy L: And I associate all child like characters to emos
3/22/16, 17:27 - Mom: u saw something?
3/22/16, 17:27 - Cindy L: Yea a girl next to my bed

3/22/16, 17:29 - Cindy L: It was only briefly, and then I realised she was hallucination
3/22/16, 17:30 - Cindy L: And then thats when I got scared and I shook my head  to make myself more awakr
3/22/16, 17:30 - Cindy L: Awake
3/22/16, 17:30 - Cindy L: And then she was gone
3/22/16, 17:30 - Cindy L: So I'm not even sure if I saw her or not
3/22/16, 17:31 - Cindy L: Cuz I can't remember what she was doing at all
3/22/16, 17:31 - Mom: i feel rather uncomfortable that u had so many hallucinations in uk

3/22/16, 17:34 - Mom: what is ur logic?

3/23/16, 17:34 - Mom: if u find out not fitting in or wanting that subj, just find other way out
3/23/16, 17:34 - Mom: that's it, not a big prob
3/23/16, 17:34 - Cindy L: Er.. That's what I'm doing?
3/23/16, 17:34 - Mom: like me, i don't like to be cpa and had thought of switching to law
3/23/16, 17:35 - Mom: so, no hate emotion
3/23/16, 17:37 - Cindy L: Ok
3/23/16, 17:37 - Mom: but now thinking back, to do financial control thingy is not that bad

3/23/16, 17:38 - Cindy L: And yr 2 and 3 looks better more interesting

3/23/16, 17:39 - Mom: like me
3/23/16, 17:39 - Cindy L: So I will never work out what happened
3/23/16, 17:39 - Mom: if i've something unsettled, i wud just stick on it and have unsettled emotion
3/23/16, 17:39 - Cindy L: Yaj

3/23/16, 17:40 - Cindy L: So I must change
3/23/16, 17:40 - Cindy L: Who cares, it's not an easily solvable problem anyways
3/23/16, 17:40 - Mom: yea, u have to accept the current situation and go ahead to other thing u want to do
3/23/16, 17:41 - Mom: or else, u can't complete anything just like me

3/24/16, 01:57 - Mom: but u still have to get their deg
3/24/16, 01:57 - Cindy L: tru tru
3/24/16, 01:57 - Mom: only their deg/cert is worthwhile
3/24/16, 01:58 - Cindy L: u mean worth the money
3/24/16, 01:58 - Mom: yea
3/24/16, 01:58 - Cindy L: wah uk so different
3/24/16, 01:58 - Cindy L: all the lectures are recorded but they use special systems to make sure non-public can't view them
3/24/16, 01:58 - Mom: and even if there're online materials, not every one is well discipline to do all the learning there
3/24/16, 01:59 - Cindy L: dude there's no difference if u go listen to lecture at uni or at home in ur own time.
3/24/16, 01:59 - Cindy L: at uni lvl, u are expected to discipline urself
3/24/16, 02:00 - Mom: ur right, but if u belong to that particular uni, u still have pressure to finish the coursework materials and get grades if u want to get a deg/diploma
3/24/16, 02:01 - Mom: but for online self learner, u just don't have that award that makes ppl don't have commitment
3/24/16, 02:01 - Cindy L: no just go to the library
3/24/16, 02:01 - Cindy L: i feel like i pay school fees partly to use the library
3/24/16, 02:01 - Cindy L: and office hours
3/24/16, 02:02 - Cindy L: hahahha
3/24/16, 02:02 - Mom: that deg/award is a sense of achievement and being a student has a sense of belonging to a particular social group
3/24/16, 02:02 - Mom: u get what i mean?
3/24/16, 02:02 - Cindy L: u know lse lets u do exams overseas as well if u pay?
3/24/16, 02:02 - Cindy L: i could literally complete an lse degree at home
3/24/16, 02:02 - Mom: that means u can stay in hk and do all those course materials?
3/24/16, 02:03 - Cindy L: u need exceptional reason
3/24/16, 02:03 - Cindy L: cuz classes are mandatory
3/24/16, 02:03 - Mom: health reason
3/24/16, 02:03 - Mom: how do u attend classes if u stay in home country?
3/24/16, 02:04 - Cindy L: but otherwise, u can literally complete like a term at home
3/24/16, 02:04 - Cindy L: i guess u need good grades, like a high 2:1
3/24/16, 02:04 - Cindy L: to convince them u can manage by yourself
3/24/16, 02:05 - Cindy L: maybe not health reason, unless u broke a bone or something
3/24/16, 02:05 - Mom: also health reason
3/24/16, 02:05 - Mom: which is most convincing
3/24/16, 02:05 - Cindy L: no they'll tell u to suspend
3/24/16, 02:06 - Cindy L: cuz u're not well
3/24/16, 02:06 - Cindy L: that's why unless bed ridden
3/24/16, 02:06 - Mom: huh.....
3/24/16, 02:06 - Mom: if bed ridden, u can't even read course materials
3/24/16, 02:07 - Cindy L: that's why i say a good reason would only be if u broke ur leg
3/24/16, 02:07 - Mom: hahahah
3/24/16, 02:07 - Mom: got ur parcel finally?
3/24/16, 02:07 - Cindy L: i haven't checked
3/24/16, 02:07 - Mom: omg
3/24/16, 02:08 - Cindy L: they hadn't sorted out the parcels at reception when i got back
3/24/16, 02:08 - Mom: ic
3/24/16, 02:08 - Cindy L: and the night security guards don't know about mail
3/24/16, 02:08 - Mom: reception is not 24 hrs?
3/24/16, 02:09 - Cindy L: no its not a hotel
3/24/16, 02:09 - Cindy L: they employ students
3/24/16, 02:09 - Mom: so it's closed after office hours?
3/24/16, 02:09 - Cindy L: they have shifts
3/24/16, 02:10 - Mom: so dhl is probably not lying that day?
3/24/16, 02:10 - Cindy L: but there's always people there
3/24/16, 02:10 - Mom: icic
3/24/16, 02:10 - Cindy L: maybe when they got there, they switched to the security guards already
3/24/16, 08:58 - Cindy L: So my exams end in the last week of may
3/24/16, 09:01 - Cindy L: The Berkeley sessions starts Jun 20
3/24/16, 09:01 - Cindy L: So I think I will need to change the emirate flight to around may 31 possible
3/24/16, 09:02 - Cindy L: Then I hv abt two or three weeks in hk
3/24/16, 09:03 - Cindy L: And then ucb ends 8/20 I think
3/24/16, 09:04 - Cindy L: Which means I hv nothing to do in sept
3/24/16, 09:05 - Cindy L: Oh I also need to get and i-20 visa as visiting student
3/24/16, 09:05 - Cindy L: The visa waiver for ukers is not eligible for study for credit purpose
3/24/16, 09:06 - Cindy L: Basically i can do that through Berkeley so that's fine
3/24/16, 09:15 - Mom: to where?
3/24/16, 09:16 - Mom: so u intend to come back on 1 jun and then fly to ucb for summer program right?
3/24/16, 09:17 - Mom: and why u need a i-20 visa, with ur uk passport u can stay in usa for 6 months as a visitor, it doesn't matter what ur doing there
3/24/16, 09:18 - Mom: student visa is need only for study more than 6 months
3/24/16, 10:01 - Cindy L: No its for full time study for credit purpose
3/24/16, 10:01 - Cindy L: It says on the Berkeley site as well
3/24/16, 10:02 - Cindy L: Anyways they automatically do it for u when u apply
3/24/16, 10:02 - Cindy L: I don't know how to not get the i20 visa
3/24/16, 10:10 - Mom: how many credits for that summer course?
3/24/16, 10:11 - Mom: u said they automatically do it for u when u apply, doesn't it mean u don't have to do it urself?
3/24/16, 10:11 - Mom: i'll check their website
3/24/16, 11:12 - Cindy L: 4 credits plus lab
3/24/16, 11:13 - Cindy L: Not sure why Stanford's is like 8 credits
3/24/16, 11:13 - Cindy L: But the same length
3/24/16, 11:13 - Cindy L: Maybe I should do that one
3/24/16, 11:13 - Cindy L: As in its part of the application
3/24/16, 11:13 - Cindy L: The school will send the i20 to me
3/24/16, 14:03 - Mom: i've read the ucb's summer program and the f-1 visa requirement
3/24/16, 14:04 - Mom: yea, u need to apply for a f-1 visa
3/24/16, 14:04 - Mom: i think u probably have to apply in uk cuz ur PR status shud be UK
3/24/16, 14:05 - Mom: and interview at us consular is required for the issuance of the f-1 visa, for uk residence no payment is required and appointment to be made in 10 working days
3/24/16, 14:07 - Mom: for that general chemistry course ur planning to enrol, is it the same as the syllabus of A-level chem?
3/24/16, 14:07 - Mom: and the website says HS chem is pre-requisite?
3/24/16, 14:08 - Mom: another prob is the lodging - where ru going to stay for that summer course period? does the uni provide campus residence?
3/24/16, 14:10 - Mom: one more prob is the insurance, i'll chk with ur existing student insurance to see if they can extend the cover to this summer course
3/24/16, 16:15 - Cindy L: Housing is on campus
3/24/16, 16:15 - Cindy L: Imagine a Summer camp, it is literally like that
3/24/16, 16:16 - Cindy L: The application process has a whole section on visa
3/24/16, 16:16 - Cindy L: U don't need to apply for a visa urself
3/24/16, 16:16 - Cindy L: They determine the kind of visa u need to get depending on the type of student u are
3/24/16, 16:20 - Cindy L: OK I checked again
3/24/16, 16:20 - Cindy L: I-20 is the form
3/24/16, 16:20 - Cindy L: To get an f-1 visa
3/24/16, 16:21 - Cindy L: Jesus christ
3/24/16, 16:23 - Cindy L: <Media omitted>
3/24/16, 16:27 - Cindy L: So Berkeley will send me the i-20 form
3/24/16, 16:45 - Mom: i read through the materials already, u still need to do the f-1 visa at us consular, ucb just prepare u I-20 and u have to do the visa urself like what u did at lse
3/24/16, 17:30 - Cindy L: Yah
3/24/16, 17:34 - Cindy L: I got the ginseng btw
3/24/16, 17:34 - Cindy L: It's much larger

3/25/16, 12:43 - Cindy L: Yah

3/25/16, 12:44 - Cindy L: I heard this Amerian dude in the student study area who said he hasn't been showing up for the past three weeks

3/25/16, 12:45 - Cindy L: He was talking to this girl next to her
3/25/16, 12:45 - Cindy L: And she was talking abt getting a first I think
3/25/16, 12:46 - Cindy L: And then he asked her was lse r first choice
3/25/16, 12:46 - Cindy L: Ofc not lah in uk
3/25/16, 12:46 - Cindy L: Probably oxbridge
3/25/16, 12:46 - Cindy L: She was pretty resentful abt it
3/25/16, 12:47 - Cindy L: And then the guy was like so do u hv an ambition or something
3/25/16, 12:47 - Cindy L: The girl said no, she didn't know what to do in the future
3/25/16, 12:47 - Cindy L: OK his answer was hilarioua
3/25/16, 12:47 - Cindy L: He said then it doesn't matter where u go now
3/25/16, 12:48 - Mom: He's right if she doesn't care abt doing what n the future
3/25/16, 12:48 - Cindy L: It's not she doesn't care
3/25/16, 12:48 - Cindy L: It's that she doesn't know
3/25/16, 12:49 - Cindy L: And I thought that was such an insightful answer
3/25/16, 12:49 - Mom: Sounds like u?
3/25/16, 12:49 - Cindy L: Dude most ppl in lse r lost sheep
3/25/16, 12:49 - Cindy L: Confused lost sheep
3/25/16, 12:49 - Cindy L: If u have an ambition, u would hv been accepted into top tier uni
3/25/16, 12:50 - Cindy L: Cuz think abt it, the courses are the same anyways and if u're a good student u'd be fine academically
3/25/16, 12:50 - Mom: no, lse is not that bad
3/25/16, 12:50 - Cindy L: The only difference is the type of network u get
3/25/16, 12:50 - Cindy L: Thats why people go to  Stanford cuz they hv direct industry links
3/25/16, 12:51 - Mom: it's extremely difficult to get into stanford, u know
3/25/16, 12:51 - Cindy L: Research unis are better to go there at master lever
3/25/16, 12:51 - Cindy L: Level
3/25/16, 12:52 - Cindy L: Cuz its not that common to get entrepreneurs?
3/25/16, 12:52 - Cindy L: I think u hv to see itself as a creative force to get admitted into top tech schoola
3/25/16, 12:53 - Cindy L: Second tier would be people who are more forces of status quo
3/25/16, 12:53 - Mom: academically excellence is not a guarantee for those stanford, mit, harvard unis
3/25/16, 12:54 - Mom: u still need connections
3/25/16, 12:54 - Cindy L: .....
3/25/16, 12:54 - Mom: this is the inside rule of game
3/25/16, 12:54 - Cindy L: Nah I think if u really hv creative potential they will take u
3/25/16, 12:54 - Cindy L: Harvard is a bit differebt
3/25/16, 12:55 - Cindy L: Unless Oxbridge
3/25/16, 12:55 - Mom: er.....
3/25/16, 12:55 - Cindy L: But it's true if u hv no amibition it really doesn't matter where u end up at the end of the day
3/25/16, 12:56 - Mom: why didn't u do ur homework ah?
3/25/16, 12:57 - Cindy L: What homework ah
3/25/16, 12:57 - Cindy L: Stop asking questions out of the blue
3/25/16, 12:57 - Cindy L: I don't know u r referring to

3/25/16, 12:59 - Mom: lots of shit
3/25/16, 13:00 - Cindy L: U know classwork doesn't go towards grade
3/25/16, 13:00 - Cindy L: So again it doesn't matter
3/25/16, 13:00 - Cindy L: I just started revising in my own time and use the office hrs instead
3/25/16, 13:01 - Mom: then even if didn't do those classwork, u shud go to class to avoid those absence right?
3/25/16, 13:01 - Mom: will they ban u from taking exam if u skip too much class?
3/25/16, 13:06 - Cindy L: No
3/25/16, 13:07 - Cindy L: U know they spend class marking the problem set

3/26/16, 18:45 - Cindy L: I wanna go out but I need a reason
3/26/16, 18:45 - Cindy L: Or a purpose
3/26/16, 18:45 - Cindy L: And a destination
3/26/16, 18:46 - Mom: Sainsbury
3/26/16, 18:46 - Cindy L: I already went yesterday laj
3/26/16, 18:46 - Mom: U can go everyday
3/26/16, 18:46 - Cindy L: I don't go everyday to save money
3/26/16, 18:47 - Mom: Lol
3/26/16, 18:47 - Cindy L: Yah.
3/26/16, 18:47 - Cindy L: Hahah
3/26/16, 18:47 - Mom: Then just go for s walk
3/26/16, 18:47 - Mom: a
3/26/16, 18:47 - Cindy L: Yah maybe
3/26/16, 18:48 - Mom: üëç
3/26/16, 18:48 - Cindy L: But I don't want to go too far or else I might get tired and start sleeping on the street.
3/26/16, 18:49 - Mom: Don't sleep on the street, that's dsngerous
3/26/16, 18:49 - Cindy L: Yah, but it hasn't happened for a while
3/26/16, 18:50 - Cindy L: So I dunno if it'll still happen
3/26/16, 18:51 - Mom: Just go round HH
3/26/16, 18:51 - Cindy L: Also
3/26/16, 18:52 - Cindy L: So I started changing my diet after reading that book
3/26/16, 18:52 - Cindy L: I cut sugar, and eat high fiber
3/26/16, 18:52 - Cindy L: Mostly fruit and veg
3/26/16, 18:52 - Cindy L: But I fall asleep faster after meal.
3/26/16, 18:53 - Mom: But fruit has fructose
3/26/16, 18:53 - Cindy L: The book said u can hv fructose if u eat a lot of fibre with it
3/26/16, 18:53 - Cindy L: Cuz fibre slows down liver flux
3/26/16, 18:53 - Cindy L: So u metabolise it  slower
3/26/16, 18:54 - Cindy L: But it's really baffling me why I sleep immediately after meal
3/26/16, 18:55 - Mom: Why no protein
3/26/16, 18:55 - Mom: Cut fructose as well
3/26/16, 18:55 - Cindy L: Plus protein OK I didnt type everything.
3/26/16, 18:56 - Cindy L: I'ma thirsty without fruit
3/26/16, 18:56 - Cindy L: Like really thirsty
3/26/16, 18:56 - Cindy L: Like a man stranded in a desert thirsty
3/26/16, 18:56 - Mom: Green tea ginseng tea
3/26/16, 18:57 - Cindy L: Fruits r allowed man.
3/26/16, 18:57 - Cindy L: OK fine I'll only have berries
3/26/16, 18:57 - Cindy L: Cuz they r antioxidants
3/26/16, 18:57 - Mom: Ru having diabetes? Thirsty?
3/26/16, 18:58 - Cindy L: Oh right
3/26/16, 18:58 - Cindy L: Talking abt diabetes
3/26/16, 18:58 - Cindy L: I remember something I read
3/26/16, 18:59 - Mom: Also, is the napping time different?
3/26/16, 19:00 - Cindy L: <Media omitted>
3/26/16, 19:01 - Cindy L: Well I think I napped for abt 20-30 min after dinner just now
3/26/16, 19:01 - Cindy L: So it's the same
3/26/16, 19:03 - Cindy L: I swear i did a fasting glucose test
3/26/16, 19:03 - Mom: but u normally just nap after bkf and lunch? Not after dinner?
3/26/16, 19:04 - Cindy L: Not really
3/26/16, 19:04 - Cindy L: Napping after bkf is more regular
3/26/16, 19:04 - Cindy L: Lunch and dinner not so much
3/26/16, 19:04 - Mom: U did fasting test, I can't rmb now
3/26/16, 19:04 - Cindy L: Plus I eat outside for lunch and dinner with other people as well
3/26/16, 19:05 - Cindy L: And I haven't fallen asleep on front of them after dinner.
3/26/16, 19:05 - Cindy L: Yea I did fasting glucose, o remember asking any diabetes and they said no
3/26/16, 19:06 - Cindy L: But that doesn't rule out high insulin resistance
3/26/16, 19:06 - Mom: So u just fall asleep when u est alone?
3/26/16, 19:06 - Mom: eat
3/26/16, 19:06 - Cindy L: I guess.
3/26/16, 19:06 - Cindy L: Like bkf
3/26/16, 19:06 - Mom: ü§î
3/26/16, 19:07 - Cindy L: Maybe it's like the thing with passivity again
3/26/16, 19:07 - Cindy L: If I keep quite in class, I can fall asleep
3/26/16, 19:07 - Cindy L: Cuz I'm not engaging with my environment
3/26/16, 19:08 - Mom: Hmmm
3/26/16, 19:08 - Cindy L: Tbf it is easier to stay awake when someone is constantly talking to you
3/26/16, 19:09 - Mom: U hv just cit sugar for a while only, maybe it takes more time to see any changes
3/26/16, 19:09 - Cindy L: Err I'm reporting very immediate changes here.
3/26/16, 19:10 - Mom: Yea, immediate
3/26/16, 19:10 - Cindy L: Just whenever I hv fruit and veg
3/26/16, 19:10 - Mom: Sometimes changes need more time
3/26/16, 19:10 - Cindy L: I seem to fall asleep faster
3/26/16, 19:10 - Mom: This is weird
3/26/16, 19:10 - Cindy L: I remember when I used to hv tomato and avocado salad for bkf, the same thing happen
3/26/16, 19:11 - Cindy L: I fall asleep much faster than if I were to hv porridge
3/26/16, 19:11 - Mom: Did u pit sugar in porridge
3/26/16, 19:11 - Cindy L: 1 tsp, 
With porridge I would feel sleepy in my head and then I would put my head down to sleep
3/26/16, 19:12 - Cindy L: With fruit and veg, I just pass out quickly.
3/26/16, 19:15 - Mom: Theoretically sugar is simple glucose which takes immediate effect on ur blood level, and fructose is complex sugar which takes longer time to digestion
3/26/16, 19:15 - Cindy L: Yes
3/26/16, 19:16 - Cindy L: Look I'll find u he fibre passage
3/26/16, 19:16 - Mom: But ur responses r just opposite
3/26/16, 19:17 - Cindy L: What u mean ah?
3/26/16, 19:18 - Mom: dont get it?
3/26/16, 19:18 - Cindy L: I mean why do u say the responses r opposite?
3/26/16, 19:20 - Mom: if u eat simple sugar, ur blood glucose level is affected immediate so u'll feel sleepy muc more faster than having complex sugar
3/26/16, 19:21 - Cindy L: Ok
3/26/16, 19:21 - Mom: but now, ate fruits and felt asleep faster
3/26/16, 19:21 - Mom: isn't this opposite?
3/26/16, 19:22 - Cindy L: Strange. who knows how the liver works after all
3/26/16, 19:22 - Mom: this is what the book tells me
3/26/16, 19:23 - Mom: also the book says eating avocado makes u more alert
3/26/16, 19:23 - Cindy L: I found the passage
3/26/16, 19:23 - Mom: but u still have opposite effect
3/26/16, 19:24 - Cindy L: <Media omitted>
3/26/16, 19:26 - Mom: so u shud have passed out so quickly
3/26/16, 19:27 - Cindy L: No just not sure what exactly is causing me to pass out after meals
3/26/16, 19:27 - Mom: bc it didnt have much effect on ur blood glucose level
3/26/16, 19:28 - Mom: it much be sugar, if not what else?
3/26/16, 19:28 - Cindy L: Lol but u don't even know if glucose makes the brain sleep or if it's another thing.
3/26/16, 19:29 - Cindy L: Anyways it does make sense for glucose to cause the brain to sleep anyways cuz glucose is burnt to create atp., which should instead give energy.
3/26/16, 19:29 - Cindy L: So it's probably not glucose.
3/26/16, 19:30 - Cindy L: My guess is that it's a hormones which signals to the  hypothalamus
3/26/16, 19:30 - Cindy L: A hormone
3/26/16, 19:31 - Mom: most of the orexin is found in ur gut, and sugar can inhibit orexin activity
3/26/16, 19:31 - Mom: when orexin activity becomes slow, then ppl feel sleepy after meal
3/26/16, 19:31 - Cindy L: But it's the orexin in the hypothalamus which causes ppl to be awake
3/26/16, 19:33 - Cindy L: Insulin signalling to hypothalamus can stimulate orexigenesis
3/26/16, 19:33 - Mom: yea but ur feeling sleepy after meal not the normal wakefulness
3/26/16, 19:34 - Cindy L: Orexigensis is when u prioritize energy conservation and fat storage
3/26/16, 19:35 - Cindy L: Which means s I have to hv high insulin levels in my blood
3/26/16, 19:35 - Mom: err...
3/26/16, 19:35 - Cindy L: This doesn't really make sense
3/26/16, 19:35 - Mom: had to think again
3/26/16, 19:36 - Cindy L: How come fruit and veg wil lead to higher insulin production
3/26/16, 19:36 - Cindy L: So it's probably not insulin.
3/26/16, 19:37 - Mom: i always founf ur responses didnt make sense
3/26/16, 19:37 - Mom: but i cant figure out why
3/26/16, 19:38 - Cindy L: Well that's problem with the theory then
3/26/16, 19:38 - Cindy L: Back to the drawing board time.
3/26/16, 19:39 - Mom: rmb that every dr's training is based on those theory
3/26/16, 19:39 - Mom: and that's why there r lots of misdiagnosis
3/26/16, 19:40 - Cindy L: Well yea, but I've also noticed that universities don't do a good job of teaching ppl how to think
3/26/16, 19:40 - Mom: at lse or on the whole?
3/26/16, 19:40 - Cindy L: I think on the whole.
3/26/16, 19:41 - Mom: hmm...
3/26/16, 19:41 - Cindy L: Lse even worse cuz ppl r just here to get their degree
3/26/16, 19:42 - Mom: burt why ib wud like lse grad?
3/26/16, 19:42 - Cindy L: Cuz hardworking, independent, I think?
3/26/16, 19:42 - Cindy L: I dunno, working in an ib doesn't really require thinking.
3/26/16, 19:43 - Cindy L: Anyways they assume u don't know shit and hv to teach u everything again.
3/26/16, 19:43 - Mom: u cant say so
3/26/16, 19:43 - Mom: being an iber is tough
3/26/16, 19:44 - Cindy L: The kind of thinking i am referring to is the special type of critical thinking
3/26/16, 19:44 - Mom: u have to be smart enough to be taught
3/26/16, 19:44 - Cindy L: I'm not talking abt general smartness
3/26/16, 19:44 - Cindy L: Or creativity
3/26/16, 19:45 - Mom: there's only a few smart and creative ppl in the world
3/26/16, 19:46 - Cindy L: I am specifically referring to critical thinking which involve thinking abt how theories are applied
3/26/16, 19:46 - Cindy L: Yeah unis dont do a great job of teaching that really.
3/26/16, 19:47 - Mom: i think only researcher or scientists wud do it
3/26/16, 19:48 - Cindy L: That's true
3/26/16, 19:49 - Cindy L: It requires thinking abt the limitations of particular knowledge and methods.
3/26/16, 23:09 - Cindy L: Mopps I just found a scale
3/26/16, 23:10 - Cindy L: And it said I was 74kg üò≠
3/27/16, 02:28 - Mom: Omg
3/27/16, 02:29 - Mom: üò∞
3/27/16, 02:52 - Mom: ur still 69.5 by end dec15, now it's just 3 months' time adding almost 5 kg
3/27/16, 02:53 - Mom: do ur pants still fit?
3/27/16, 04:41 - Mom: i think u must cut off all ur everyday juice if u had it b4 cuz i wonder if ur in having a pre-diabetic condition which might make u gaining weighs instead of losing weigh
3/27/16, 04:41 - Mom: depression or ur metabolic prob also contribute to gaining weigh
3/27/16, 04:46 - Mom: ur slow gut might also be the reason for weigh gain
3/27/16, 12:06 - Cindy L: My pants fit.
3/27/16, 12:06 - Cindy L: My thighs are the same size
3/27/16, 12:07 - Cindy L: Maybe slimmer than before I think
3/27/16, 12:08 - Cindy L: Most of the fat is in the abdomen.
3/27/16, 12:08 - Cindy L: But if I stand straight, my stomach is still reasonably flat
3/27/16, 12:09 - Cindy L: So unless my butt got bigger
3/27/16, 12:09 - Cindy L: But I don't think so either cuz I still fit in the leggings I brought with me in the beginning and they even fit looser now.
3/27/16, 12:13 - Cindy L: Actually i think I might hv grown taller.
3/27/16, 12:14 - Cindy L: Will need to check
3/27/16, 12:15 - Cindy L: But is this a bit late for a girl to hv a growth spurt?
3/27/16, 12:30 - Mom: anyway, cut sugar and juice which has lots of added sugar
3/27/16, 12:41 - Cindy L: I already did that's an obvious one
3/27/16, 12:42 - Cindy L: Now to learn how to chug sugarless coffee
3/27/16, 12:44 - Cindy L: My friends are all off travelling to Europe and Scandinavia
3/27/16, 12:44 - Cindy L: üòíüòíüòí
3/27/16, 12:47 - Mom: told u to come back hk la
3/27/16, 12:47 - Mom: üò≠
3/27/16, 12:48 - Mom: they didn't tell u?
3/27/16, 12:48 - Mom: üò°üò°
3/27/16, 12:57 - Cindy L: I meant my flatpeople
3/27/16, 12:57 - Cindy L: Not together, just like individually
3/27/16, 12:57 - Cindy L: But who wants to travel alone.
3/27/16, 12:58 - Mom: so, ur alone at ur dorm?
3/27/16, 12:59 - Cindy L: Pretty much
Im just waiting for the lib to open on Tuesday
3/27/16, 13:01 - Mom: do ur revision la
3/27/16, 13:02 - Cindy L: Lol I was talking to my friend who went to monash
3/27/16, 13:02 - Cindy L: She said she did 8 units a years
3/27/16, 13:02 - Cindy L: A yeat
3/27/16, 13:02 - Cindy L: Year
3/27/16, 13:03 - Cindy L: In comaprison, I do 4 a year
3/27/16, 13:03 - Cindy L: Hahahaha
3/27/16, 13:06 - Mom: perhaps course content different?
3/27/16, 13:06 - Mom: what does she do?
3/27/16, 13:06 - Mom: medicine?
3/27/16, 13:10 - Cindy L: Biochem
3/27/16, 13:10 - Cindy L: But that is some real difference there.
3/27/16, 13:14 - Mom: what difference?
3/27/16, 13:18 - Cindy L: 4and 8
3/27/16, 13:24 - Mom: but theirs r half yr course and urs r one yr course
3/27/16, 13:24 - Mom: anyway, don't complain la
3/27/16, 13:36 - Cindy L: I'm not complaining
3/27/16, 13:36 - Cindy L: I was jist highlighting the difference
3/27/16, 13:36 - Cindy L: We r bitching abt uni app fees now
3/27/16, 13:42 - Mom: do u know how much is that for monash uni?
3/27/16, 13:46 - Cindy L: She said she paid 600hkd for 24 degree apps
3/27/16, 13:47 - Mom: what 600hkd for 24 apps?
3/27/16, 13:47 - Mom: that's cheap
3/27/16, 13:47 - Mom: why they can do so many apps?
3/27/16, 13:52 - Cindy L: Dunno different system
3/27/16, 15:41 - Cindy L: Mopps
3/27/16, 15:42 - Cindy L: I come with philosophical matters today
3/27/16, 15:47 - Mom: yea
3/27/16, 15:47 - Mom: ?
3/27/16, 15:47 - Mom: why u have so many Q?
3/27/16, 15:55 - Cindy L: Dunno cuz I am an inquisitive person
3/27/16, 15:56 - Mom: so what is ur prob?
3/27/16, 15:56 - Cindy L: So
3/27/16, 15:57 - Cindy L: Do u think a parent has a moral obligation to pay for their child's schooling
3/27/16, 15:57 - Mom: what do u think?
3/27/16, 15:57 - Cindy L: I've been to trying to argue for this point for the past 60 mins
3/27/16, 15:58 - Mom: to whom?
3/27/16, 15:58 - Cindy L: to my friend
3/27/16, 15:58 - Mom: and ur viewpoint is?
3/27/16, 15:58 - Cindy L: Assuming that is true, that means the child does not hv to be grateful to their parents for doing so.
3/27/16, 15:59 - Mom: u think so?
3/27/16, 15:59 - Cindy L: That is not to say the child should not be grateful
3/27/16, 15:59 - Cindy L: But should be for another reason.
3/27/16, 16:00 - Cindy L: I mean if u think abt it, if ur parents just grew u like a plant, gave u food and shelter and clothes, etc. That doesnt mean that they r necessary a good parent.
3/27/16, 16:00 - Cindy L: That just means they r fulfilling their moral duties.
3/27/16, 16:01 - Cindy L: Cuz if they didnt, they ought to be thrown into jail
3/27/16, 16:01 - Cindy L: We were talking abt what it means to be a good parent obviously.
3/27/16, 16:02 - Cindy L: So following logical sense, if u fulfilled ur moral duties that makes u a 'parent'.
3/27/16, 16:02 - Mom: my parents just gave me shelter, food, clothes and some schooling, so they're bad parents?
3/27/16, 16:03 - Cindy L: But morals change with time
3/27/16, 16:03 - Cindy L: They aren't fixed.
3/27/16, 16:03 - Mom: there is no moral obligations of parents
3/27/16, 16:03 - Cindy L: Yeah there is, a parent must hv legal obligations
3/27/16, 16:04 - Mom: look into the wiki, what is the parents' legal and moral duties?
3/27/16, 16:04 - Cindy L: And laws are what a state deems to be the morals of the time
3/27/16, 16:05 - Cindy L: But surely if u don't provide food for ur child u can be prosecuted
3/27/16, 16:05 - Mom: which law tells us parents have legal obliagtions?
3/27/16, 16:05 - Cindy L: Same for if u leave ur child at home unattended.
3/27/16, 16:06 - Cindy L: Yup UK Constitution there are parental responsibilities
3/27/16, 16:06 - Cindy L: U must provide a homr
3/27/16, 16:06 - Cindy L: Home
3/27/16, 16:06 - Mom: ei, that's different
3/27/16, 16:06 - Mom: there is an obvious law stating that parents can't leave a child under 16 at home alone, doing so is an offence
3/27/16, 16:07 - Mom: but there isn't any law requiring parents to provide food ans shelter to their child
3/27/16, 16:08 - Cindy L: Right what's parental responsibility then
3/27/16, 16:08 - Mom: if that child is left on the street, his parents won't be prosecuted
3/27/16, 16:08 - Cindy L: The law sets out who has parental responsibility
3/27/16, 16:09 - Cindy L: Right
3/27/16, 16:10 - Cindy L: What abt wilful neglect
3/27/16, 16:10 - Mom: as i told u, there's no legal and moral obligations imposed on parents to take good care and raise their child to the optimal benefit of the child
3/27/16, 16:10 - Cindy L: Wtf
3/27/16, 16:10 - Cindy L: Why
3/27/16, 16:10 - Mom: why what?
3/27/16, 16:10 - Mom: no legal duties?
3/27/16, 16:11 - Cindy L: Did the person who was writing the law not think that it might be helpful to encode these things into the law
3/27/16, 16:13 - Cindy L: OK if it's not a parents obligation to take care of u, how is it possible that people expect the government to take care of them?
3/27/16, 16:14 - Cindy L: There's something seriously not right here üòíüòíüòí
3/27/16, 16:14 - Mom: i think parent and child relationship can be ruled by stated law cuz the decision to giving birth a child is on love
3/27/16, 16:14 - Mom: and the law can't tell u what to do with ur love
3/27/16, 16:14 - Mom: do u think there shud be law to govern lovers' events or activities
3/27/16, 16:16 - Mom: ppl expect govt to take care of their children is just totally irresponsible acts
3/27/16, 16:16 - Mom: value r srsly distort these days
3/27/16, 16:18 - Cindy L: Lol I'm reading Forbes and they say in America parents r obliged to pay school fees until 18
3/27/16, 16:18 - Mom: but ur right, parents shud have moral obligations to take good care of their child cuz when they decide to raise a child, their intention it to continue family's existence
3/27/16, 16:19 - Mom: which is purely a personal decision
3/27/16, 16:19 - Mom: wow, american write that on their law?
3/27/16, 16:20 - Mom: what if their parents can't afford?
3/27/16, 16:21 - Cindy L: State school?
3/27/16, 16:21 - Cindy L: Americans write dumb things in their law
3/27/16, 16:22 - Mom: govt pay for state school?
3/27/16, 16:22 - Cindy L: Yah
3/27/16, 16:22 - Cindy L: So essentially tax payer
3/27/16, 16:23 - Mom: even so, there're still lots of negligent parents in usa
3/27/16, 16:23 - Cindy L: The matter becomes a lot more complicated when u consider taxation
3/27/16, 16:24 - Cindy L: Interesting
3/27/16, 16:25 - Cindy L: Just me being an lse nerd
3/27/16, 16:26 - Mom: yea, this is a complicate issue when it comes to moral, and resources allocation prob in the society
3/27/16, 16:27 - Mom: that's why we need ppl studying ppe to go into govt office
3/27/16, 16:27 - Cindy L: Right
3/27/16, 16:27 - Cindy L: Oh!
3/27/16, 16:28 - Cindy L: Apparently I heard ppe was actually introduced by the student rep committee
3/27/16, 16:28 - Cindy L: In the gov dept
3/27/16, 16:28 - Mom: why?
3/27/16, 16:28 - Cindy L: Dunno, cuz they wanted to be like Oxford?
3/27/16, 16:28 - Cindy L: But it wasn't actually lse's idea.
3/27/16, 16:29 - Mom: thb, when u do govt policy u can't avoid philosophical issue
3/27/16, 16:29 - Cindy L: I heard from a girl who switched from ppe to econ and philo
3/27/16, 16:29 - Cindy L: That's true and Oxford is best at philo, so that's why their ppe program is good
3/27/16, 16:30 - Cindy L: Given that they hv 1-1 tutorial, I would say even if u  didn't think much before, u would afterwards.
3/27/16, 16:31 - Cindy L: I heard law is really hard though
3/27/16, 16:31 - Cindy L: Or so the law students say
3/27/16, 16:31 - Mom: well, i don't think other uni can afford the 1-1 tutorial
3/27/16, 16:31 - Cindy L: Yea
3/27/16, 16:31 - Mom: where? in oxford?
3/27/16, 16:32 - Cindy L: In lse
3/27/16, 16:32 - Mom: law in lse is hard?
3/27/16, 16:32 - Cindy L: That's what they say
3/27/16, 16:33 - Cindy L: Partly cuz they don't teach u
3/27/16, 16:33 - Cindy L: Hahahaha
3/27/16, 16:33 - Cindy L: Govt teaching is quite good but everyone hates it
3/27/16, 16:33 - Mom: why hate it?
3/27/16, 16:34 - Mom: i think they're rather ok or good in teaching, as i heard from u
3/27/16, 16:34 - Cindy L: Dunno, cuz they force u to do philosophy in first yr
3/27/16, 16:34 - Cindy L: It's only gov teaching which is good
3/27/16, 16:34 - Cindy L: Econ and math teaching is abysmal
3/27/16, 16:34 - Cindy L: I've heard econ history is a fun dept
3/27/16, 16:35 - Mom: but econ dept is the most famous dept in the world, i do think there must be some reason for it
3/27/16, 16:35 - Cindy L: Research
3/27/16, 16:35 - Cindy L: Yea actually I don't know how they r the best in the world.
3/27/16, 16:35 - Cindy L: And the name Shapiro keeps coming up
3/27/16, 16:36 - Mom: he's a american lawyer
3/27/16, 16:37 - Mom: tbh at uni level, u can't expect teaching like hs
3/27/16, 16:37 - Cindy L: No but math and econ are really abysmal
3/27/16, 16:38 - Mom: all ur provided is the resources of materials and tutor available for ur Q, right?
3/27/16, 16:38 - Cindy L: U know how the classes r meant to be for discussion right
3/27/16, 16:38 - Cindy L: I guess it's a bit hard to do so at first year level
3/27/16, 16:39 - Mom: yea, for sci subjects, prof/tutors shud teach the basic knowledge
3/27/16, 16:39 - Mom: but for humanities, teaching is not necessarily required
3/27/16, 16:39 - Mom: cuz ur always required to form ur own opinion
3/27/16, 16:40 - Mom: might be a bit difficult to first yr student to transfer to this kind of teachin
3/27/16, 16:40 - Mom: teaching
3/27/16, 16:40 - Cindy L: Fair enough
3/27/16, 16:40 - Cindy L: I still think gov course is most well structured
3/27/16, 16:41 - Mom: so ur lucky in this dept
3/27/16, 16:41 - Cindy L: Probably cuz the previous course leaders were really good
3/27/16, 16:42 - Cindy L: I keep seeing the giant picture of Paul Kelly
3/27/16, 16:42 - Mom: why? and for what?

3/27/16, 16:43 - Cindy L: He used to teach gv100
3/27/16, 16:43 - Mom: what? he's a musician
3/27/16, 16:43 - Cindy L: He was so good this second yr I know used to keep a little picture of him.
3/27/16, 16:44 - Mom: how come he teaches gv100
3/27/16, 16:44 - Cindy L: Not that Paul kelly
3/27/16, 16:44 - Cindy L: A different Paul kelly
3/27/16, 16:44 - Mom: ic

3/27/16, 17:22 - Mom: what reflection?
3/27/16, 17:23 - Mom: in fact, lse isn't that bad
3/27/16, 17:28 - Cindy L: I'm doing reflective writing for their beloved course
3/27/16, 17:28 - Cindy L: I'm 30 words short right now
3/27/16, 17:29 - Mom: must  be 600 words?
3/27/16, 17:29 - Mom: can't be a little shorter?
3/27/16, 17:29 - Cindy L: 600-800
3/27/16, 17:29 - Cindy L: I'm already writing the minimum
3/27/16, 17:29 - Mom: then just bullshit some 30 words, that's ur strength
3/27/16, 17:30 - Cindy L: What can I say about essay writing
3/27/16, 17:31 - Mom: self reflection or comment abt the course?
3/27/16, 17:31 - Cindy L: Self reflection

3/29/16, 15:48 - Cindy L: Lol
3/29/16, 15:48 - Mom: living in the forest?
3/29/16, 15:48 - Cindy L: I was just thinking.
3/29/16, 15:49 - Cindy L: Remember the person who has chronic sp
3/29/16, 15:49 - Cindy L: He also has eczema.
3/29/16, 15:50 - Cindy L: Seems like eczema typically comes with a lot of freebies.
3/29/16, 15:50 - Cindy L: I thought I was lucky that I didn't hv asthma.
3/29/16, 15:50 - Mom: but i don't think eczema wud cause sleep disorders
3/29/16, 15:51 - Cindy L: But of autoimmune disorders yes
3/29/16, 15:51 - Cindy L: If
3/29/16, 15:51 - Mom: yes, but is that serious enough to cause eczmea
3/29/16, 15:52 - Mom: if yes, then most ppl having eczema wud have sleep disorders
3/29/16, 15:52 - Mom: and btw ur eczema is not that serious that wud cause u having sleep disorders
3/29/16, 15:53 - Cindy L: No but if u think abt it, most ppl who hv eczema hv multiple problems
3/29/16, 15:53 - Cindy L: Like asthma
3/29/16, 15:53 - Mom: think abt the girl living on the 8th floor at Tierra Verde
3/29/16, 15:54 - Cindy L: I can bet that that girl has multiple problems.
3/29/16, 15:54 - Cindy L: For one, ment health is already a vulnerable issue
3/29/16, 15:55 - Mom: but eczema don't cause mental health
3/29/16, 15:57 - Cindy L: Yea but hving a disfigured face does.
3/29/16, 15:58 - Mom: err...

3/29/16, 16:03 - Cindy L: It's the quality of the skin which has changed.

3/29/16, 16:03 - Mom: but how?
3/29/16, 16:03 - Mom: she didn't do anything to it

3/29/16, 16:10 - Mom: abt what?
3/29/16, 16:10 - Cindy L: What if we're wrong abt diabetes
3/29/16, 16:10 - Cindy L: That's what it's called

3/29/16, 17:21 - Cindy L: No thoughts?
3/29/16, 17:21 - Cindy L: What he says is basically a summary of the book I'm reading.
3/29/16, 17:21 - Cindy L: And I think that's basically what happened to us.
3/29/16, 17:33 - Mom: to me & you?
3/29/16, 17:34 - Mom: but we don't know exactly ur blood glucose figure?
3/29/16, 17:34 - Mom: fasting and after drinking syrup
3/29/16, 17:35 - Mom: mine r normal even during pregnancy period
3/29/16, 17:36 - Mom: why do u think u've insulin resistance?
3/29/16, 17:36 - Mom: it's just no way to test insulin
3/29/16, 17:52 - Cindy L: The phenomena is too similar
3/29/16, 17:53 - Cindy L: We suddenly gained a lot of weight and can't lose it through exercise.
3/29/16, 17:53 - Mom: no, i think i'm not in insulin resistance state
3/29/16, 17:54 - Mom: my prob might just be lack of exercise
3/29/16, 17:54 - Cindy L: Don't forget u drank a lot of cokee.
3/29/16, 17:54 - Cindy L: I exercised so much last summer and nothing happened.
3/29/16, 17:55 - Mom: yea, that's the point i got fatter and fatter
3/29/16, 17:56 - Cindy L: U can see he almost wanted to cry by the end of the talk.
3/29/16, 17:56 - Mom: my prob is fluid retention
3/29/16, 17:56 - Cindy L: Right
3/29/16, 17:56 - Cindy L: Damn
3/29/16, 17:56 - Mom: yea, he's so good to be a dr
3/29/16, 17:56 - Mom: so human
3/29/16, 17:56 - Mom: not like those in hk
3/29/16, 17:57 - Cindy L: That's only after he suffered through metabolic syndrome himself though
3/29/16, 17:57 - Mom: at least, he did have apologized at the end of his talk
3/29/16, 17:58 - Cindy L: Good. I'm great someone agrees.
3/29/16, 17:58 - Cindy L: *Glad
3/29/16, 17:59 - Cindy L: But apparently dermatologists r still assholes.
3/29/16, 17:59 - Mom: yea, for those all in hk
3/29/16, 18:00 - Cindy L: üò†
3/29/16, 18:01 - Mom: shud be this üò°üò°üò°
3/29/16, 18:02 - Cindy L: Yah
3/29/16, 18:02 - Cindy L: Exactly.
3/29/16, 18:03 - Cindy L: Tedmed is good.
3/29/16, 18:03 - Mom: i see why u resent to be a dr initially
3/29/16, 18:03 - Cindy L: U see
3/29/16, 18:04 - Cindy L: But now I see I ought to hv become a dr
3/29/16, 18:05 - Cindy L: üòì
3/29/16, 18:05 - Mom: sigh.....
3/29/16, 18:06 - Cindy L: And u see why I think that if wrote abt my own experience American unis would buy it.
3/29/16, 18:07 - Mom: perhaps, but i just worried if they wud have doubt abt ur ability to complete ur studies?
3/29/16, 18:07 - Mom: hope that won't happen
3/29/16, 18:07 - Cindy L: I guess, yah that's also an issue
3/29/16, 18:08 - Cindy L: Down to the reference then I guess
3/29/16, 18:24 - Cindy L: Good news
3/29/16, 18:24 - Cindy L: I see signs of a period
3/29/16, 18:09 - Mom: what down to the ref?
3/29/16, 18:26 - Mom: ?
3/29/16, 18:26 - Cindy L: Like whatever she wrote abt me in the ref
3/29/16, 18:26 - Mom: so u've period right?
3/29/16, 18:27 - Cindy L: I thought abt maybe urging her details such as me being an attentive student in class
3/29/16, 18:28 - Cindy L: But I didn't cuz my adviser was a shitbag and annoying as hell already.
3/29/16, 18:28 - Mom: lol
3/29/16, 18:28 - Mom: she's a korean?
3/29/16, 18:28 - Cindy L: Yea so what
3/29/16, 18:28 - Cindy L: I'm not a korean
3/29/16, 18:29 - Mom: i mean she might not be that helpful, not like american
3/29/16, 18:29 - Cindy L: Right yah in those terms I don't think anyone in lse would be helpful then
3/29/16, 18:30 - Mom: lol
3/30/16, 13:29 - Cindy L: Good news
3/30/16, 13:29 - Cindy L: My period has finally came

3/30/16, 14:09 - Cindy L: My thighs r sore
3/30/16, 14:09 - Mom: how many days u had bad cramps last period?
3/30/16, 14:09 - Cindy L: Well thank God I prepped lunch and dinner yesterday
3/30/16, 14:09 - Cindy L: Er .... Dunno one or two?
3/30/16, 14:09 - Cindy L: I only had four days of period last time
3/30/16, 14:10 - Mom: wow, only little blood?
3/30/16, 14:10 - Cindy L: My last time was also abt 11 weeks ago
3/30/16, 14:10 - Cindy L: Which I release is almost 3 months
3/30/16, 14:10 - Cindy L: That's quite irregular
3/30/16, 14:11 - Mom: too bad
3/30/16, 14:11 - Mom: u can't drink chinese herb
3/30/16, 14:11 - Cindy L: No wonder my skin was itching a few days agos
3/30/16, 14:11 - Cindy L: Ago
3/30/16, 14:12 - Mom: and now? still itchy?
3/30/16, 14:12 - Cindy L: Not as much
3/30/16, 14:12 - Cindy L: But there was one night my fingers were very itchy
3/30/16, 14:13 - Mom: the middle finger?
3/30/16, 14:13 - Cindy L: No like all of them
3/30/16, 14:13 - Mom: oh come on
3/30/16, 14:13 - Mom: so u felt extremely tired b4 period come?
3/30/16, 14:13 - Cindy L: Erm..
3/30/16, 14:14 - Cindy L: Dunno, I slept more I think
3/30/16, 14:14 - Cindy L: But I also went out on monday for the whole day
3/30/16, 14:14 - Mom: that's normal
3/30/16, 14:14 - Mom: no nap on monday?
3/30/16, 14:14 - Cindy L: I went to namco with a friend
3/30/16, 14:14 - Cindy L: Lol
3/30/16, 14:15 - Cindy L: My face started becoming dry after monday
3/30/16, 14:15 - Mom: where is that in london?
3/30/16, 14:16 - Cindy L: Lol its the gaming arcade
3/30/16, 14:16 - Cindy L: We have it in HK too
3/30/16, 14:16 - Cindy L: It's like jumping gym
3/30/16, 14:16 - Mom: u went to play?
3/30/16, 14:16 - Cindy L: Yarh
3/30/16, 14:19 - Mom: but i don't think ur skin is just affected in 2 days b4 period cuz the unfertilized ovule has to travel for abt 10+ to ur uterus and the hormonal effect took place since then
3/30/16, 14:20 - Cindy L: Yah I mean I only started feeling the dryness yesterday, but I probably already started turning bad a while ago.
3/30/16, 14:22 - Cindy L: Sup
3/30/16, 14:22 - Mom: who know?
3/30/16, 14:22 - Mom: it's rlly difficult
3/30/16, 14:22 - Mom: like emos's face, one day good one day bad.....
3/30/16, 14:23 - Mom: rlly bad these week
3/30/16, 14:23 - Mom: don't know why?
3/30/16, 14:23 - Cindy L: Cuz spring
3/30/16, 14:23 - Cindy L: Just cuz
3/30/16, 14:23 - Mom: maybe
3/30/16, 14:23 - Mom: as she said
3/30/16, 14:23 - Cindy L: The humidity is bad
3/30/16, 14:24 - Cindy L: But winter was quite humid too when I came back in December
3/30/16, 14:24 - Cindy L: How was she then?
3/30/16, 14:25 - Mom: rlly bad these 2 days
3/30/16, 14:25 - Mom: she said she is the human hygrometer
3/30/16, 14:25 - Cindy L: But sometimes she's fine in the summer
3/30/16, 14:26 - Cindy L: And basically it's wet throughout the season
3/30/16, 14:26 - Mom: just mysterious?
3/30/16, 14:27 - Mom: i think her sleep quality might also affect the skin quality
3/30/16, 14:27 - Mom: as she always sleeps alot during holidays and her skin is especially bad on these days
3/30/16, 14:28 - Cindy L: Or it might be the other way.. That skin quality affect sleep quality
3/30/16, 14:28 - Mom: but she's forced to wake up early during school days, her skin is better
3/30/16, 14:29 - Mom: that's why i thought sleep ---> skin
3/30/16, 14:29 - Cindy L: Then force her to wake up earlier
3/30/16, 14:29 - Mom: cuz if u sleep too much after 11am, u body/liver is not good
3/30/16, 14:30 - Mom: u know it's difficult to force her to wake up earlier during holiday cuz she's rlly a lazy bone
3/30/16, 14:31 - Mom: she can only be regulated by tight morning appointments
3/30/16, 14:31 - Mom: like class or others
3/30/16, 14:31 - Cindy L: üòë
3/30/16, 14:32 - Cindy L: Doesn't she hv to do work experience after Easter though?
3/30/16, 14:32 - Mom: yea but in may this yr
3/30/16, 14:33 - Cindy L: I see
3/30/16, 14:33 - Mom: i urge her to write application letter but she just ignore me
3/30/16, 14:33 - Cindy L: What's she doing
3/30/16, 14:33 - Cindy L: Oh
3/30/16, 14:33 - Mom: don't know
3/30/16, 14:33 - Mom: she just doesn't want to work
3/30/16, 14:34 - Mom: she said how wud a 14 years old kid know what to do in the future?
3/30/16, 14:34 - Mom: the i üòì
3/30/16, 14:35 - Cindy L: That's true
3/30/16, 14:35 - Mom: yea
3/30/16, 14:35 - Cindy L: U know dentistry requires work exp though
3/30/16, 14:35 - Cindy L: For app
3/30/16, 14:35 - Mom: she's always right
3/30/16, 14:35 - Mom: but how can u find a dentist for 5 days work experience?
3/30/16, 14:36 - Cindy L: Need to do over the summer
3/30/16, 14:36 - Cindy L: Here the hospitals r so good, they hv recruitment
3/30/16, 14:36 - Cindy L: And they let u watch surgeries
3/30/16, 14:36 - Mom: nvm, she's just yr 10, she still has 2 summer
3/30/16, 14:37 - Mom: u mean uk
3/30/16, 14:37 - Cindy L: Yah
3/30/16, 14:37 - Mom: but wud they recruit yr 10 students or just uni student?
3/30/16, 14:37 - Cindy L: Cuz everything is following the system
3/30/16, 14:37 - Cindy L: So they know u need it and will let u apply
3/30/16, 14:38 - Mom: wow, that's good
3/30/16, 14:39 - Cindy L: But that's cuz they are part of the system
3/30/16, 14:41 - Mom: it's in the education system?
3/30/16, 14:48 - Cindy L: I think teaching and training are more in line with each other
3/30/16, 14:49 - Mom: if that's in the uk education system, then employers can't deny
3/30/16, 14:49 - Mom: but there's not similar policy here in hk
3/30/16, 18:44 - Cindy L: So it's almost seven
3/30/16, 18:45 - Cindy L: And it still looks like it's 3 outside
3/30/16, 18:45 - Cindy L: Does the sun never set?
3/31/16, 02:47 - Mom: lol
3/31/16, 02:48 - Mom: summer time ma
3/31/16, 02:52 - Mom: u know, it's Benjamin Franklin who introduced this summer time concept many yrs b4 to save candles
3/31/16, 12:27 - Cindy L: Hahahahaha
3/31/16, 12:55 - Mom: This is not joking, just change ur lifestyle and u can save resources and save the world
3/31/16, 13:12 - Cindy L: Woe
3/31/16, 13:12 - Cindy L: That just turned very insightful for a moment
3/31/16, 13:13 - Cindy L: And it's not even changing lifestyle
3/31/16, 13:13 - Cindy L: It's just changing the time
3/31/16, 13:16 - Mom: u need to cuz u've to adjust ur internal clock and wake up an hr earlier
3/31/16, 13:45 - Cindy L: Hmmm
3/31/16, 13:46 - Cindy L: That's if u assume ur body clock is fixed.
3/31/16, 13:46 - Cindy L: I think it's relative.
3/31/16, 13:54 - Mom: but still u got to get up an hr earlier and everything is done according to that summer time
3/31/16, 13:55 - Mom: office open an hr earlier right?
3/31/16, 14:35 - Cindy L: No but if u open at two, u still open at two. Makes no difference really. The only time u hv to do this earlier is the day they change. That's when u need to go to sleep an hr earlier like my neighbour said.
3/31/16, 14:35 - Cindy L: Other than that life goes on.
3/31/16, 14:36 - Cindy L: But I think this example would make a very good speech opener üòãüëç
3/31/16, 14:36 - Mom: what example?
3/31/16, 14:37 - Mom: right, shops/office still open at 9 but this is actually an hr earlier?
3/31/16, 14:41 - Cindy L: Yea but u still open at 9
3/31/16, 14:41 - Cindy L: I.e. if everything shifts u don't notice the difference
3/31/16, 14:42 - Cindy L: Like u don't notice the earth spinning
3/31/16, 14:42 - Cindy L: So it's only earlier for us who don't hv summer time
3/31/16, 14:42 - Cindy L: Daylight saving
3/31/16, 14:42 - Cindy L: That was my point
3/31/16, 14:46 - Mom: exactly, the earth is still going round the sun at the same speed and same manner, it's pp adjusting daily life an hr earlier
3/31/16, 14:50 - Cindy L: Also I feel like I may hv grown taller
3/31/16, 14:58 - Cindy L: OK no, still 165.5
3/31/16, 14:58 - Cindy L: üò•
3/31/16, 14:59 - Cindy L: My body fat distribution seems to hv changed though
3/31/16, 14:59 - Cindy L: Must be estrogens then
3/31/16, 15:22 - Cindy L: Omg
3/31/16, 15:22 - Cindy L: High holborn rent for next yr
3/31/16, 15:22 - Cindy L: 277.55 per week
3/31/16, 15:27 - Mom: wow
3/31/16, 15:27 - Mom: robbery?
3/31/16, 15:52 - Cindy L: But I'm looking at the external ones and they're at least 300
3/31/16, 15:55 - Mom: where?
3/31/16, 16:51 - Cindy L: Like near Camden and King's cross
3/31/16, 17:12 - Mom: studio flat?
3/31/16, 17:12 - Mom: u can still apply for 2nd yr dorm
3/31/16, 17:12 - Cindy L: Yea mostly studio flat
3/31/16, 17:13 - Cindy L: Yes I'm applying for dorm
3/31/16, 17:13 - Cindy L: But I'm not guaranteed of getting anything.
3/31/16, 17:13 - Mom: bankside or roseberry?
3/31/16, 17:13 - Cindy L: Roseberry is really popular
3/31/16, 17:13 - Cindy L: Impossible
3/31/16, 17:13 - Cindy L: Bankside has no kitchen
3/31/16, 17:14 - Mom: difficult
3/31/16, 17:14 - Mom: how abt shared flat?
3/31/16, 17:14 - Cindy L: Yea
3/31/16, 17:14 - Cindy L: Or those where u live with the landlord
3/31/16, 17:15 - Mom: like airbnb?
3/31/16, 17:15 - Cindy L: No like the person just rents out rooms
3/31/16, 17:15 - Cindy L: Like if u cleaned up tsing yi
3/31/16, 17:15 - Cindy L: And rented out the small room or somethibg
3/31/16, 17:16 - Mom: ic
3/31/16, 17:16 - Cindy L: But that would be really terrible
3/31/16, 17:16 - Cindy L: Hahahaha
3/31/16, 17:16 - Mom: ofc la
3/31/16, 17:16 - Mom: for a girl, it's not safe
3/31/16, 17:17 - Cindy L: Then shared flat I guess
3/31/16, 17:17 - Mom: how abt ur flatmates? where wud they go?
3/31/16, 17:17 - Cindy L: Hmm I think they're staying in holborn
3/31/16, 17:17 - Cindy L: Cuz one of them is pres on the hall committee
3/31/16, 17:17 - Mom: but not guaranteed right?
3/31/16, 17:17 - Cindy L: Yea not guaranteed
3/31/16, 17:17 - Mom: see
3/31/16, 17:17 - Cindy L: Except for the pres
3/31/16, 17:18 - Cindy L: If u on committee then u hv to stay
3/31/16, 17:18 - Cindy L: Most ppl go live in urban nest
3/31/16, 17:20 - Mom: r they rented by private owners?
3/31/16, 17:33 - Cindy L: No urbannest is semiexternal
3/31/16, 17:33 - Mom: i just check their price, it's very expensive
3/31/16, 17:33 - Cindy L: It's operated by external company, but u hv to apply through lse
3/31/16, 17:33 - Cindy L: Yea
3/31/16, 17:34 - Cindy L: But not as expensive as holborn
3/31/16, 17:34 - Cindy L: And don't forget if u live far, then u hv to fcator in transport
3/31/16, 17:34 - Cindy L: Factor
3/31/16, 17:34 - Mom: yea
3/31/16, 17:34 - Cindy L: And the tube is annoying on so many lvls
3/31/16, 17:34 - Cindy L: Not only is it more expensive
3/31/16, 17:35 - Cindy L: It's difficult to get student oyster
3/31/16, 17:35 - Mom: but if u live in King's Cross/St Pancreas, it's still far away to walk to school
3/31/16, 17:35 - Cindy L: And it always has delays or strikes
3/31/16, 17:35 - Cindy L: I hv a friend who lives in kigs cross and he just walks
3/31/16, 17:36 - Mom: better to walk than taking the underground
3/31/16, 17:36 - Cindy L: I think bus is best
3/31/16, 17:37 - Mom: taking bus like walking
3/31/16, 17:37 - Cindy L: But then u can only top up ur oyster at the tube station which is dumb
3/31/16, 17:37 - Cindy L: The bus does not accept coins!!!! üò•
3/31/16, 17:38 - Mom: can't auto-top up?
3/31/16, 17:38 - Mom: or through internet?
3/31/16, 17:38 - Cindy L: Oyster?
3/31/16, 17:38 - Mom: yea, check withe their website
3/31/16, 17:38 - Mom: i saw that b4
3/31/16, 17:38 - Cindy L: No those r contactless credit cards
3/31/16, 17:39 - Cindy L: Which have so many security issues
3/31/16, 17:39 - Cindy L: Do u hv one?
3/31/16, 17:39 - Mom: no
3/31/16, 17:39 - Cindy L: U should get a steel wallet if u do
3/31/16, 17:39 - Mom: why wud have i?
3/31/16, 17:39 - Cindy L: Like paywave
3/31/16, 17:39 - Cindy L: That counts too
3/31/16, 17:39 - Mom: i even return that oyster when i left uk
3/31/16, 17:40 - Cindy L: No Im talking abt contactless cards
3/31/16, 17:40 - Mom: but in wonder if i can apply one?
3/31/16, 17:40 - Cindy L: They hv so many security issues Id suggest not to
3/31/16, 17:40 - Mom: cuz i don't hv bank ac in uk
3/31/16, 17:41 - Cindy L: Then probably not
3/31/16, 22:06 - Cindy L: So it finally turned dark
3/31/16, 22:06 - Cindy L: Im thinking of where circadian rhythm comes from
3/31/16, 22:06 - Cindy L: And I'm pretty sure it's light
3/31/16, 22:06 - Cindy L: Cuz I'm very awake right now even though it's 10 pm
3/31/16, 22:07 - Cindy L: And it feels like the evening.
3/31/16, 22:07 - Cindy L: The whole daylight saving thing is not working either
3/31/16, 22:08 - Cindy L: They need to shift a few more hrs...
3/31/16, 23:58 - Mom: Hahaha, good Q
4/1/16, 00:00 - Mom: But I think the summer time shifting comes from the tome of sunrise instead of sunset
4/1/16, 07:36 - Mom: just woke up?
4/1/16, 09:30 - Mom: Do u know if ur lse thingy arrived NU safely?
4/1/16, 11:45 - Mom: Your pretzels have expired.
4/1/16, 12:36 - Mom: just woke up?

4/1/16, 16:33 - Mom: don't put them in the box that cuz a lot of mail charges
4/1/16, 16:46 - Cindy L: No I kept them in the Amazon packaging
4/1/16, 16:46 - Cindy L: It doesn't weigh that much it's the books
4/1/16, 16:47 - Cindy L: It's 2kg
4/1/16, 16:47 - Mom: don't keep int amazon original package, that's huge and weigh heavy
4/1/16, 16:47 - Cindy L: I'm mailing international small parcel, cheapest one already
4/1/16, 16:48 - Mom: if u put them into a plastic bag into an envelop, that wud be alot weigh less
4/1/16, 16:48 - Cindy L: Envelope?
4/1/16, 16:48 - Mom: 20 pounds?
4/1/16, 16:48 - Cindy L: The books are a thick stack

4/1/16, 16:49 - Cindy L: No free stationary in london

4/1/16, 16:50 - Mom: so u paid already?

4/1/16, 16:51 - Mom: need what?
4/1/16, 16:51 - Cindy L: The bubble wrap
4/1/16, 16:51 - Mom: then u keep them urself
4/1/16, 16:52 - Cindy L: Look, the books themselves r very heavy
4/1/16, 16:52 - Mom: okok, i'll see if i can find other way cheaper
4/1/16, 16:52 - Cindy L: Even if I wrap in plastic bag, it'll still cost more than 15pp
4/1/16, 16:52 - Cindy L: Ok
4/1/16, 16:53 - Cindy L: Btw
4/1/16, 16:53 - Cindy L: R those urgent?

4/1/16, 16:54 - Mom: what?
4/1/16, 16:54 - Mom: they're so heavy
4/1/16, 16:54 - Cindy L: My friend said it might be cheaper than storing
4/1/16, 16:54 - Mom: u don't need them for next yr?
4/1/16, 16:55 - Cindy L: I do
4/1/16, 16:55 - Mom: have u check for the storage charges in london?
4/1/16, 16:55 - Cindy L: Checking now
4/1/16, 16:56 - Mom: if u rlly want to send back ur stuff, i mean all those next yr's stuff, u better ship them here by sea freight
4/1/16, 16:56 - Mom: that's much more cheaper
4/1/16, 16:56 - Cindy L: Yah maybe that's what he meant
4/1/16, 16:57 - Cindy L: OK so I hv two suitcases and a hand carry
4/1/16, 16:58 - Cindy L: I'll work this out first. I hv quite a lot to put in storage
4/1/16, 16:58 - Mom: kk
4/1/16, 16:59 - Mom: how's ur mail to NU?
4/1/16, 16:59 - Mom: still going or arrived?
4/1/16, 17:00 - Cindy L: Dunno haven't asked admissions
4/1/16, 17:00 - Cindy L: I should hv mailed tracking
4/1/16, 17:00 - Cindy L: But it's soo expensive
4/1/16, 17:00 - Mom: no email from them?
4/1/16, 17:01 - Cindy L: No they don't email u
4/1/16, 17:01 - Cindy L: U just send the stuff, hope they get it
4/1/16, 17:01 - Cindy L: And then few months later get a response
4/1/16, 17:02 - Cindy L: But it's rolling admissions as well, so dunno when I'm gonna get a response
4/1/16, 17:02 - Cindy L: Probably later around june
4/1/16, 17:02 - Mom: but if they don't get it, they'll probably ask for them?
4/1/16, 17:02 - Cindy L: Yea I guess
4/1/16, 17:02 - Mom: i think u shud check ur email always
4/1/16, 17:02 - Cindy L: I always check my email...
4/1/16, 17:03 - Mom: everyday?
4/1/16, 17:03 - Cindy L: It's like automatic behaviour already
4/1/16, 17:03 - Cindy L: I open my laptop, check my email
4/1/16, 17:03 - Cindy L: Though to be fair, it might be in spam
4/1/16, 17:04 - Cindy L: Should check spam as well
4/1/16, 17:04 - Mom: so funny in spam
4/1/16, 17:04 - Mom: don't have gmail app in ur mobile
4/1/16, 17:04 - Cindy L: I do
4/1/16, 17:05 - Cindy L: But they don't notify u of spam
4/1/16, 17:05 - Mom: then u shud notification when mails come in
4/1/16, 17:05 - Cindy L: Yes I do
4/1/16, 17:06 - Mom: what abt if they don't go straight to the primary mail but others, is there any pop-up notifications?
4/1/16, 17:07 - Cindy L: No I just check my email
4/1/16, 17:08 - Mom: u do have mail from NU, go to update section
4/1/16, 17:10 - Cindy L: Ok
4/1/16, 17:10 - Cindy L: I see it
4/1/16, 17:10 - Cindy L: Well they definitely mailed both of them
4/1/16, 17:10 - Cindy L: So Royal mail must be slow
4/1/16, 17:11 - Cindy L: Cuz the transcript hasn't arrives and its been a week I think
4/1/16, 17:12 - Mom: it takes 7-10 days to reach us, i think
4/1/16, 17:13 - Mom: i think u shud tell them that those missing items r coming by mail so that they know u did have done all the necessary action
4/1/16, 17:13 - Cindy L: I'm seeing my letter board the plane and then get to the US and then delivered by postman riding a red bike to some remote place in Illinois
4/1/16, 17:13 - Mom: ofc don't tell them that u mail them directly
4/1/16, 17:14 - Mom: u can check that mail?
4/1/16, 17:14 - Cindy L: I'll just ask them if it's there.
4/1/16, 17:14 - Cindy L: Given all the undergrad shit, it probably takes time to process as well
4/1/16, 17:14 - Mom: who process?
4/1/16, 17:15 - Cindy L: By nu
4/1/16, 17:15 - Mom: but it looks they're rather responsible cuz they'll chase for missing items
4/1/16, 17:15 - Cindy L: When it arrives at the office of admission, someone needs to open each one and sort each of them
4/1/16, 17:15 - Cindy L: Yeah yeah all unis do that
4/1/16, 17:15 - Cindy L: I'm not surprised
4/1/16, 17:16 - Mom: yea, so it takes more time
4/1/16, 17:16 - Cindy L: Last time my Sat report took ages to get there
4/1/16, 17:16 - Cindy L: And then I just sent them online
4/1/16, 17:16 - Mom: but do they send it by mail or through internet?
4/1/16, 17:16 - Cindy L: Cuz college board messes up
4/1/16, 17:17 - Cindy L: College board?
4/1/16, 17:17 - Cindy L: They send a physical copy?
4/1/16, 17:17 - Cindy L: Lol that's kinda dumb
4/1/16, 17:17 - Cindy L: Probably online
4/1/16, 17:17 - Cindy L: They hv their internal system like naviance or something
4/1/16, 17:17 - Mom: electronic devices r so convenient
4/1/16, 17:17 - Cindy L: Duh
4/1/16, 17:17 - Mom: why the hell they don't use it
4/1/16, 17:18 - Cindy L: I don't know
4/1/16, 17:18 - Cindy L: I even checked with common app to see if college report can be submitted online
4/1/16, 17:18 - Cindy L: They said no
4/1/16, 17:18 - Mom: üòìüò´
4/1/16, 17:19 - Cindy L: Plus I think it's gonna take a while cuz Easter just happened
4/1/16, 17:19 - Mom: maybe
4/1/16, 17:19 - Cindy L: Yah

4/1/16, 17:22 - Cindy L: Did the same thing
4/1/16, 17:22 - Cindy L: And then woke up at 11
4/1/16, 17:22 - Cindy L: I'm like crap I need to get out of bed
4/1/16, 17:22 - Mom: so u didn't eat bkf?
4/1/16, 17:22 - Cindy L: I did the same thing again

4/1/16, 17:23 - Mom: come on, u got correct ur sleep pattern
4/1/16, 17:24 - Mom: what time u get to bed at night?
4/1/16, 17:24 - Cindy L: My sleep pattern is normal
4/1/16, 17:24 - Cindy L: I go to sleep around 12-1
4/1/16, 17:24 - Cindy L: Normally I sleep like that in the morning anyways
4/1/16, 17:24 - Mom: what? one hr sleep one hr play? that's normal?
4/1/16, 17:24 - Cindy L: Just that I get out of bed.
4/1/16, 17:25 - Mom: did u wake up at 4 as well?
4/1/16, 17:26 - Cindy L: Er don't remember
4/1/16, 17:27 - Cindy L: No? I don't think so
4/1/16, 17:31 - Cindy L: Guess what I only used one mopiko out of six
4/1/16, 17:32 - Mom: no more itchy at london?
4/1/16, 17:33 - Mom: if u don't rmb, probably u didn't wake up at 4
4/1/16, 17:34 - Cindy L: It's not itchy
4/1/16, 17:34 - Cindy L: It's like really dry
4/1/16, 17:34 - Cindy L: And it won't absorb anything
4/1/16, 17:35 - Mom: moisturizer don't work?
4/1/16, 17:35 - Cindy L: When u try to put oil or cream on certain patches, there's like a waxy layer
4/1/16, 17:35 - Mom: just put moisturizer with patience
4/1/16, 17:35 - Mom: keep putting moisturizer
4/1/16, 17:35 - Cindy L: .....
4/1/16, 17:35 - Mom: that's the only solution to treat dry skin
4/1/16, 17:35 - Cindy L: It will eventually go away itself
4/1/16, 17:36 - Cindy L: But it happenes everytime I get my period
4/1/16, 17:36 - Mom: like emos, i told her to put mask more often in a day to keep it moist
4/1/16, 17:39 - Cindy L: ...
4/1/16, 17:55 - Mom: üòë
4/1/16, 18:02 - Cindy L: I calculated
4/1/16, 18:03 - Cindy L: It's abt ¬£60 for 15 weeks of storage
4/1/16, 18:03 - Mom: how big the size?
4/1/16, 18:04 - Cindy L: Per item
4/1/16, 18:04 - Cindy L: I expect to hv 4 or 5 items
4/1/16, 18:04 - Mom: why 4-5 items? i suppose u have only 2 big items
4/1/16, 18:04 - Mom: what size is per item?
4/1/16, 18:05 - Cindy L: Er I dunno
4/1/16, 18:05 - Cindy L: I need to sleep
4/1/16, 18:05 - Cindy L: Ttyl
4/1/16, 18:05 - Mom: k
4/1/16, 18:18 - Cindy L: OK im back
4/1/16, 18:18 - Cindy L: My heart started beaying really strongly
4/1/16, 18:18 - Cindy L: Beating
4/1/16, 18:19 - Cindy L: And then I could feel my pulse in my head
4/1/16, 18:19 - Cindy L: And I need to lie down
4/1/16, 18:19 - Cindy L: Not sure what happened
4/1/16, 18:25 - Mom: headache?
4/1/16, 18:25 - Mom: u've slept for 15 mins
4/1/16, 18:26 - Mom: ru still on period? maybe that's ur hormone
4/1/16, 18:26 - Mom: sometimes i'll have same scenario during my period
4/1/16, 18:28 - Cindy L: No cuz I get these pretty often
4/1/16, 18:29 - Cindy L: When I woke up just now I forgot where I was again
4/1/16, 18:29 - Cindy L: Probably cuz of all the blood to the head
4/1/16, 18:29 - Mom: other than heavy heartbeat, what else u feel uncomfortable?
4/1/16, 18:29 - Cindy L: Feels like a lot of blood rushig to the head
4/1/16, 18:29 - Mom: did u lie down on ur bed or just head on ur desk?
4/1/16, 18:29 - Cindy L: I went to lie down on the bed
4/1/16, 18:30 - Cindy L: It feels like what I'd imagine being on drugs feels like
4/1/16, 18:30 - Mom: this situation happens only after nap?
4/1/16, 18:30 - Mom: what on drugs?
4/1/16, 18:30 - Mom: what drugs u had?
4/1/16, 18:30 - Cindy L: None
4/1/16, 18:31 - Cindy L: No I didn't take anything
4/1/16, 18:31 - Cindy L: I'm describing what happened BEFORE I took the nap
4/1/16, 18:32 - Cindy L: After I took nap I was super confused and forgot what I had been doing before nap
4/1/16, 18:32 - Cindy L: I thought there was a mad protest going on outside the window
4/1/16, 18:34 - Mom: did u hear anything that made u feel a mad protest going on outside ur window?
4/1/16, 18:34 - Cindy L: No
4/1/16, 18:34 - Mom: can u rmb what u've done b4 ur nap now?
4/1/16, 18:35 - Cindy L: Yes
4/1/16, 18:35 - Cindy L: But immediately after I wake up, no
4/1/16, 18:35 - Cindy L: Was a bit lost any where I was and who I know
4/1/16, 18:35 - Mom: then, there's just some seconds of confusion after nap right?
4/1/16, 18:35 - Cindy L: I would say up to a minute of confusion
4/1/16, 18:35 - Cindy L: That's not really norm
4/1/16, 18:35 - Mom: but u can come back to ur whatsapp with u?
4/1/16, 18:36 - Cindy L: Yea after I worked out that I was in london
4/1/16, 18:36 - Mom: when is this situation start to happen?
4/1/16, 18:36 - Mom: since nov14?
4/1/16, 18:37 - Mom: did u dream during ur nap?
4/1/16, 18:38 - Cindy L: Probably
4/1/16, 18:38 - Cindy L: Remember last time I couldn't remember what was on the opposite side of the road when I woke up in the morning?
4/1/16, 18:38 - Cindy L: It's kind of like that
4/1/16, 18:47 - Mom: but it's just temporary, i mean for few mins?
4/1/16, 18:47 - Cindy L: Yea
4/1/16, 18:47 - Cindy L: But still
4/1/16, 18:47 - Mom: u don't rmb ur dream?
4/1/16, 18:48 - Cindy L: Can u imagine forgetting where u are, it's a weird feeling
4/1/16, 18:48 - Mom: sorry, i never have that feeling b4
4/1/16, 18:49 - Cindy L: That's probably what ppl with Alzheimer's feel like or something
4/1/16, 18:49 - Mom: but can u get back all ur memories after that confusion?
4/1/16, 18:49 - Cindy L: Yes
4/1/16, 18:49 - Cindy L: It's just temp
4/1/16, 18:51 - Mom: sorry, since when u had that kind of confusion feeling?
4/1/16, 18:51 - Cindy L: Er dunno
4/1/16, 18:51 - Cindy L: These few months?
4/1/16, 18:52 - Cindy L: I used to hv it when I had depression in the first month.
4/1/16, 18:52 - Mom: do u still have depression now?
4/1/16, 18:52 - Cindy L: But then the situation would be that I found myself still connected to hk
4/1/16, 18:52 - Cindy L: No
4/1/16, 18:53 - Cindy L: I feel like it has to do with the blood rushing to my head
4/1/16, 18:53 - Mom: what found urself still connected to hk? don't understand?
4/1/16, 18:54 - Mom: the blood rushing to ur head means ur head need more oxygen right?
4/1/16, 18:54 - Mom: so blood vessels prob?
4/1/16, 18:55 - Cindy L: No
4/1/16, 18:55 - Cindy L: In mt
4/1/16, 18:56 - Cindy L: My dreams where very vivid and often mixed with memory
4/1/16, 18:56 - Cindy L: Were
4/1/16, 18:56 - Cindy L: So when I woke up
4/1/16, 18:56 - Mom: mt?
4/1/16, 18:56 - Cindy L: The situation would be that
4/1/16, 18:56 - Cindy L: Michaelmas term
4/1/16, 18:57 - Cindy L: The situation would be that my mind would still be attached to the context of those dreams
4/1/16, 18:57 - Cindy L: Just now is a bit different
4/1/16, 18:58 - Mom: but ur dreams shud be based on ur memories + ur creativity?
4/1/16, 18:59 - Mom: do u still dream alot when sleep at night-time or nap?
4/1/16, 19:00 - Cindy L: .....
4/1/16, 19:00 - Cindy L: Actually
4/1/16, 19:00 - Cindy L: I just thought of something
4/1/16, 19:00 - Cindy L: I had a toast with chocolate before napping
4/1/16, 19:01 - Cindy L: And I also had oatmeal with a tbspn of sugar this morning
4/1/16, 19:01 - Cindy L: And a similar thing happenes
4/1/16, 19:02 - Mom: try to cut sweet thing la
4/1/16, 19:02 - Cindy L: Except in the morning I didn't go to sleep
4/1/16, 19:02 - Cindy L: But I sort of zoned out
4/1/16, 19:03 - Mom: zone out, still can't do anything right?
4/1/16, 19:03 - Cindy L: It's like that feeling where I am still sort of awake but my mind is not there
4/1/16, 19:03 - Mom: how long?
4/1/16, 19:03 - Cindy L: Er....
4/1/16, 19:03 - Cindy L: Half an hr?
4/1/16, 19:03 - Cindy L: I think
4/1/16, 19:03 - Cindy L: I was looking at stuff on the computer
4/1/16, 19:04 - Mom: so u don't know what u were doing on the computer that time right?
4/1/16, 19:04 - Cindy L: This also happened if I get too cold
4/1/16, 19:05 - Mom: so that must be the glucose conversion prob
4/1/16, 19:05 - Cindy L: It's like I was still using the computer, I keep on clicking on links but I don't remember what I was looking for or why I clicked them
4/1/16, 19:05 - Cindy L: This is like that time in primark
4/1/16, 19:05 - Cindy L: I kept on walking around on the bottom floor looking at clothes
4/1/16, 19:06 - Mom: wow, it's dangerous if ur on amazon website then u might have made purchase inadventantly
4/1/16, 19:06 - Cindy L: And then when I looked at the stuff I put in my basket later, I didn't remember putting them there
4/1/16, 19:06 - Cindy L: Not exactly
4/1/16, 19:07 - Cindy L: Its more restricted to repeating actions
4/1/16, 19:07 - Mom: u like being possessed
4/1/16, 19:07 - Cindy L: Like paying would make me wake up
4/1/16, 19:07 - Cindy L: Because I have to think abt my details
4/1/16, 19:07 - Cindy L: Exactly, like being possessed
4/1/16, 19:07 - Cindy L: But it probably has to do with sugar
4/1/16, 19:08 - Cindy L: Because before going to primark, I must hv stopped at Costa to hv a coffee and cake
4/1/16, 19:08 - Cindy L: Time to look into diabetes
4/1/16, 19:09 - Cindy L: They do say that diabetes causes brain fog
4/1/16, 19:09 - Cindy L: But it's difficult to know what brain fog is
4/1/16, 19:12 - Mom: how can u know whether that's brain fog or something else?
4/1/16, 19:13 - Cindy L: Yea exactly, I don't really know what brain fog is
4/1/16, 19:13 - Cindy L: But I guess it's difficult for the person having brain fog to describe it as well cuz they can't think straight
4/1/16, 19:14 - Mom: i think that shud relate to sugar if being possessed is not a consideration
4/1/16, 19:14 - Cindy L: üòë being possesses is not scientific
4/1/16, 19:15 - Mom: but i wud still advise u to go to church and pray
4/1/16, 19:15 - Mom: how do u know there isn't being possessed
4/1/16, 19:15 - Cindy L: Problem is do I have insulin resistance, too much insulin or too much glucose?
4/1/16, 19:15 - Mom: science still can't explain everything
4/1/16, 19:15 - Cindy L: Or are they all the same time
4/1/16, 19:15 - Cindy L: I'm pretty sure I'm not possessed
4/1/16, 19:16 - Mom: u can test ur insulin but only at doctor's office
4/1/16, 19:16 - Cindy L: Yea I guess I can go to NHS for this
4/1/16, 19:17 - Mom: okay, then have a check
4/1/16, 19:17 - Mom: just tell them that u feel exceptional sleepy after meal
4/1/16, 19:18 - Cindy L: Er yah
4/1/16, 19:18 - Mom: ur cutting sugar right?
4/1/16, 19:18 - Mom: for how long?
4/1/16, 19:18 - Cindy L: Yep since this week
4/1/16, 19:18 - Mom: anything special?
4/1/16, 19:18 - Mom: exceptional tired or anything?
4/1/16, 19:19 - Cindy L: Less hallucinations and crazy shit happening
4/1/16, 19:19 - Mom: ok
4/1/16, 19:19 - Mom: exceptional tired?
4/1/16, 19:20 - Cindy L: Don't know cuz I also hv my period this week
4/1/16, 19:20 - Mom: ic
4/1/16, 19:20 - Cindy L: At this point I would like to say narco diagnosis was probably a mistake
4/1/16, 19:20 - Cindy L: But
4/1/16, 19:21 - Cindy L: I still seem to mostly rem and I still hv cataplexy
4/1/16, 19:21 - Mom: still dream alot?
4/1/16, 19:22 - Cindy L: They r less crazy
4/1/16, 19:22 - Cindy L: And I don't remember them as much
4/1/16, 19:22 - Mom: the dream content r less crazy?
4/1/16, 19:22 - Cindy L: Yea
4/1/16, 19:22 - Mom: if u don't rmb, that's not rem dream
4/1/16, 19:22 - Cindy L: Well we don't know for sure
4/1/16, 19:23 - Cindy L: I still seem to sleep in rem cycles
4/1/16, 19:23 - Cindy L: That's what convinces me
4/1/16, 19:23 - Mom: for rem dreams, they r vivid and u can rmb clearly when u wake up
4/1/16, 19:23 - Cindy L: Yah I know
4/1/16, 19:24 - Cindy L: But I stopped writing them down, cuz they aren't interesting these days
4/1/16, 19:24 - Cindy L: So I dunno
4/1/16, 19:24 - Mom: so u just forget most of them right after u wake up?
4/1/16, 19:24 - Cindy L: They are def less crazy
4/1/16, 19:24 - Cindy L: Which makes them less memorable
4/1/16, 19:25 - Mom: ic
4/1/16, 19:25 - Cindy L: So it was probably the sugar making my brain go crazy like it was on LSD or something
4/1/16, 19:25 - Mom: wow, sugar can act like LSD
4/1/16, 19:26 - Cindy L: I think it's just me
4/1/16, 19:27 - Mom: if that's insulin resistance prob, it takes time to adjust ur insulin level
4/1/16, 19:27 - Mom: so u better keep cutting sugar for some time
4/1/16, 19:28 - Cindy L: I hv to cut sugar for a loong time man
4/1/16, 19:28 - Cindy L: I hv metabolic syndrome
4/1/16, 19:29 - Mom: i mean it takes some time to adjust ur body's insulin level back to normal
4/1/16, 19:29 - Cindy L: Do u mean after eating?
4/1/16, 19:29 - Cindy L: Or net insulin levels?
4/1/16, 19:29 - Mom: after eating
4/1/16, 19:30 - Cindy L: It takes a while for me to get sleepy
4/1/16, 19:31 - Mom: cuz ur body might have got to used to produce more insulin when u ate alot of sugar b4, but now u cut sugar and ur body wud take time to get used to the decrease level of sugar intake
4/1/16, 19:32 - Cindy L: Well yah
4/1/16, 19:32 - Cindy L: But im not sure if type 2 heals itself
4/1/16, 19:33 - Mom: u think ur in type diabetes?
4/1/16, 19:34 - Mom: i think probably not that worst
4/1/16, 19:34 - Mom: type 2
4/1/16, 19:34 - Cindy L: At this point, if I hv hypoglycemia, I'm considered pre-type 2
4/1/16, 19:34 - Mom: pre-type 2 or insulin resistance still can be reverse
4/1/16, 19:35 - Cindy L: OK great
4/1/16, 19:35 - Mom: according to my reading on the website
4/1/16, 19:35 - Mom: the point is limit sugar intake or better cut it
4/1/16, 19:35 - Cindy L: So I just continue what I'm doing so far
4/1/16, 19:36 - Mom: u probably have much glycogen stored in ur liver, so it takes time to convert them into sugar
4/1/16, 19:37 - Cindy L: Yea
4/1/16, 19:58 - Cindy L: Hey I was also wondering if I should wait until later in April to apply for the California course
4/1/16, 19:58 - Cindy L: See if I hear back from nu or ucl
4/1/16, 19:58 - Mom: why?
4/1/16, 19:59 - Cindy L: The chem course I'm applying for has tons of spaces...üòë
4/1/16, 19:59 - Mom: what's the deadline at ucb summer course?
4/1/16, 19:59 - Cindy L: Like may
4/1/16, 19:59 - Mom: i know
4/1/16, 20:00 - Mom: then wait a while and keep tracking their space available
4/1/16, 20:00 - Cindy L: Kk
4/1/16, 20:00 - Cindy L: Cuz they hv a cancellation fee
4/1/16, 20:00 - Cindy L: If u decide to change your mind
4/1/16, 20:00 - Mom: oh rlly? how much?
4/1/16, 20:00 - Cindy L: Er 100 or 300
4/1/16, 20:00 - Cindy L: I cant remember
4/1/16, 20:01 - Mom: then wait a while la
4/1/16, 20:01 - Cindy L: Kk
4/1/16, 20:01 - Mom: üëåüèª
4/2/16, 04:01 - Mom: can u tell me the dimension and weigh of those books from amazon?
4/2/16, 07:51 - Mom: okay la, don't need to give dimensions and weigh, just post it through royal mail uk to hk
4/2/16, 08:25 - Mom: http://www.discuss.com.hk/viewthread.php?tid=25668323
4/2/16, 08:25 - Mom: see this link
4/2/16, 08:25 - Mom: sleep quality is affected by ur gut prob
4/2/16, 13:11 - Cindy L: U mean ¬£20 OK?
4/2/16, 13:11 - Cindy L: I'm not sure if parcel collection opens today anyways, u may hv to wait till monday
4/2/16, 13:22 - Cindy L: Weight it is just under 2 kg, like 1.94..., but just round to 2
4/2/16, 13:22 - Cindy L: Dimension, the books themselves are a4 size
4/2/16, 13:23 - Cindy L: But I left it in the Amazon packing which is slightly taller
4/2/16, 13:23 - Cindy L: The stack is abt 50mm thick
4/2/16, 13:25 - Cindy L: So estimated dimensions abt 400 x 250 x 50
4/2/16, 13:25 - Cindy L: It's definitely smaller than the small parcel limiy
4/2/16, 14:08 - Mom: HALLO

4/2/16, 14:21 - Cindy L: Er dude I am sending by small parcel
4/2/16, 14:21 - Cindy L: It fits in the box
4/2/16, 14:21 - Cindy L: It's fine

4/2/16, 14:23 - Mom: Something around ¬£19.+++
4/2/16, 14:24 - Mom: I just saw from their website
4/2/16, 14:25 - Cindy L: Yea ok

4/2/16, 14:26 - Mom: Ok
4/2/16, 14:26 - Mom: Ty
4/2/16, 14:27 - Mom: btw why u woke up so late in the morning, almost afternion
4/2/16, 14:27 - Mom: It's not gd
4/2/16, 14:29 - Mom: and ur sleep pattern seems have changed alot these couple of months
4/2/16, 14:29 - Mom: ?
4/2/16, 14:34 - Cindy L: Omg
4/2/16, 14:34 - Cindy L: My eggs r chewy
4/2/16, 14:34 - Cindy L: They r that bad
4/2/16, 14:34 - Mom: what's that?
4/2/16, 14:34 - Mom: rotten?
4/2/16, 14:35 - Mom: r they from china?
4/2/16, 14:35 - Cindy L: No it's cuz u can't control temp on induction cooker
4/2/16, 14:35 - Cindy L: So the bottom cooks really fast
4/2/16, 14:36 - Mom: oh, when u fry eggs, u've to stir it very fast and immediately upon putting the egg on the pan
4/2/16, 14:36 - Mom: nothing to do with induction or gas stove
4/2/16, 14:37 - Cindy L: It does to make good scrambled eggs u need low temp
4/2/16, 14:37 - Cindy L: U stir fry the egg thats why they're always so oily
4/2/16, 14:37 - Mom: but u can still select low fire on ur induction stove, right?
4/2/16, 14:38 - Cindy L: Yea
4/2/16, 14:38 - Cindy L: But the way the induction cooker works does really allow u to control temp
4/2/16, 14:38 - Mom: no, that's the way i watched a korean chef to fry scramble eggs
4/2/16, 14:38 - Cindy L: But u use to always make them American style
4/2/16, 14:39 - Cindy L: And I could digest them properly in the morning
4/2/16, 14:39 - Cindy L: I couldnt
4/2/16, 14:39 - Mom: why bother american or british scramble eggs?
4/2/16, 14:40 - Cindy L: American style is when u stirfry it
4/2/16, 14:40 - Mom: okay, then make ur own style
4/2/16, 14:40 - Cindy L: Its mostly cooked and oily as shit
4/2/16, 14:40 - Mom: oh u want sunshine eggs?
4/2/16, 14:40 - Cindy L: British style is like the one u get at cafe de coral
4/2/16, 14:40 - Mom: no, just put a drop of oil and enough
4/2/16, 14:40 - Cindy L: No I'm talking abt scrambled eggs
4/2/16, 14:40 - Mom: not oily
4/2/16, 14:41 - Mom: at cafe de coral, they add milk and water in to the scramble eggs
4/2/16, 14:41 - Cindy L: Yea but u can do that too if u cook at low temp
4/2/16, 14:42 - Cindy L: And make it so that it's like semi raw
4/2/16, 14:42 - Cindy L: Cooking proteins is hard
4/2/16, 14:42 - Mom: then boil it la
4/2/16, 14:43 - Mom: like japanese style
4/2/16, 14:43 - Cindy L: Boiling is OK, but boring.
4/2/16, 14:43 - Mom: errr....
4/2/16, 14:43 - Cindy L: Semi soft eggs r also hard to make
4/2/16, 14:43 - Cindy L: U must boil for exactly 6 mins
4/2/16, 14:43 - Cindy L: And the put in cold water
4/2/16, 14:43 - Cindy L: And then taking off the shell perfectly is really difficult
4/2/16, 14:44 - Cindy L: I'm gonna try baking, I think baking is probably easiest
4/2/16, 14:44 - Mom: how?
4/2/16, 14:44 - Mom: put into oven?
4/2/16, 14:45 - Cindy L: Yea u just crack the egg into some container and bake it
4/2/16, 14:45 - Cindy L: I swear poaching an egg is also hard
4/2/16, 14:46 - Mom: why so much trouble cooking an egg?
4/2/16, 14:46 - Mom: just do whatever easiest and eat them
4/2/16, 14:46 - Mom: üòÖ
4/2/16, 14:47 - Cindy L: The way to test a good cook is by how they cook eggs
4/2/16, 14:47 - Cindy L: Eggs are hard to cook üò§
4/2/16, 14:48 - Cindy L: After that is meat
4/2/16, 14:48 - Cindy L: Meat is also hard to cook, cuz u hv to keep the juice in
4/2/16, 14:49 - Mom: but ur cooking them for own use not for selling, why bother?
4/2/16, 14:49 - Mom: i won't
4/2/16, 14:50 - Cindy L: Er mopps, first they are for personal consumption ofc u must cook it well
4/2/16, 14:51 - Cindy L: Secondly, its a waste of resources if u don't cook it well
4/2/16, 14:51 - Cindy L: Like all the chickens here r wasted, cuz they don't  cook good chicken here.
4/2/16, 14:52 - Mom: üòë
4/2/16, 14:52 - Mom: i'm not cooking them badly
4/2/16, 14:52 - Mom: i'm just cooking them in my own way for my best consumption
4/2/16, 14:53 - Cindy L: Good üëç
4/2/16, 14:53 - Mom: i always do my cooking in my own favourable way
4/2/16, 14:53 - Mom: ty
4/2/16, 14:53 - Cindy L: But the eggs
4/2/16, 14:53 - Cindy L: Not so good
4/2/16, 14:53 - Cindy L: Hahabhahahbaa
4/2/16, 14:53 - Mom: still have to eat them
4/2/16, 14:53 - Mom: try it hard next time
4/2/16, 14:54 - Cindy L: Even the guys can cook here. So i must master proteins.
4/2/16, 14:55 - Mom: ei, guys studying abroad usually can doing cooking pretty good
4/2/16, 14:55 - Mom: i wud rather say girls don't want to do cooking
4/2/16, 14:56 - Cindy L: Yea what the hell
4/2/16, 14:56 - Cindy L: The girls r all pieces of shit and live in pigstys
4/2/16, 14:56 - Mom: yea
4/2/16, 14:57 - Mom: why so ridiculous?
4/2/16, 14:57 - Cindy L: U should see the Indian girl's room
4/2/16, 14:57 - Cindy L: It makes me shiver to think of it
4/2/16, 14:59 - Mom: u saw the inside?
4/2/16, 15:01 - Mom: well even though she's rich and don't have to do housework at home, but as an indian girl, she still need to serve her husband in the future, right?
4/2/16, 15:01 - Mom: how could she be that shitty?
4/2/16, 15:01 - Cindy L: Yea that's what I thought
4/2/16, 15:01 - Cindy L: But her brother and his wife came a few days ago and they are very different
4/2/16, 15:01 - Cindy L: Maybe it's just her.
4/2/16, 15:03 - Mom: i think she probably will change at the time she's married
4/2/16, 15:03 - Cindy L: Probs
4/2/16, 15:03 - Cindy L: The mainlander is also super weird
4/2/16, 15:04 - Cindy L: She eats shit tons of instant ramen and ice cream
4/2/16, 15:04 - Cindy L: I opened the freezer one day and it was just tubs of ice cream in there.
4/2/16, 15:06 - Mom: wow, so much weird guys in this world
4/2/16, 15:09 - Mom: i was shopping at wellcome just half an hour ago with emos, and when we were queuing for the cashier, i saw the one in front of us having bought tons of junk food and i was thinking that why those ppl eating tons of junk foods everyday r still healthy, but we eat most of the healthy food and numerous weird illness?
4/2/16, 15:09 - Mom: wtf
4/2/16, 15:09 - Cindy L: Ikr so unfair
4/2/16, 15:09 - Mom: exactly
4/2/16, 15:09 - Cindy L: But they probably hv metabolic problem anyways
4/2/16, 15:09 - Cindy L: Or will hv
4/2/16, 15:10 - Mom: let see
4/2/16, 15:10 - Cindy L: I guess it's like people who smoke and still live to 99
4/2/16, 15:10 - Mom: yea so sad
4/2/16, 15:10 - Cindy L: Did I mention that my flatmate bought A TROPICAL FISH
4/2/16, 15:11 - Mom: what tropical fish?
4/2/16, 15:11 - Mom: gold fish?
4/2/16, 15:12 - Cindy L: No like those specially breeded ones
4/2/16, 15:12 - Mom: alive?
4/2/16, 15:12 - Mom: he's breeding it at the dorm?
4/2/16, 15:13 - Cindy L: Yes in a fish tank
4/2/16, 15:13 - Cindy L: With a heating system
4/2/16, 15:13 - Cindy L: And filter
4/2/16, 15:13 - Cindy L: And everything
4/2/16, 15:13 - Mom: where he put that filtration system?
4/2/16, 15:13 - Cindy L: Crazy
4/2/16, 15:13 - Mom: in his room or in the kitchen?
4/2/16, 15:14 - Mom: anyway, what is that fish?
4/2/16, 15:14 - Mom: does it bite ppl?
4/2/16, 15:15 - Cindy L: No
4/2/16, 15:15 - Cindy L: In his room
4/2/16, 15:16 - Cindy L: I know he spent a good 200pp on that fish
4/2/16, 15:16 - Cindy L: And it nearly died in the first week
4/2/16, 15:16 - Cindy L: After he set up all the tank and filter and shit
4/2/16, 15:17 - Cindy L: That was funny
4/2/16, 15:17 - Mom: ¬£200?
4/2/16, 15:18 - Mom: wow, he must be very rich to spend 200 pounds on that fish?
4/2/16, 15:18 - Cindy L: Lol that not a lot
4/2/16, 15:18 - Cindy L: He spent over 1000pp on a girl
4/2/16, 15:18 - Mom: for what?
4/2/16, 15:19 - Cindy L: Like valentines day and birthday
4/2/16, 15:19 - Mom: he must be a rich guy?
4/2/16, 15:19 - Emos: dumbass
4/2/16, 15:19 - Cindy L: üòÇ
4/2/16, 15:19 - Cindy L: I dunno, not really
4/2/16, 15:20 - Cindy L: Lol
4/2/16, 15:21 - Cindy L: I think lesson of the day is don't let a first year uni student manage their own finances
4/2/16, 15:21 - Mom: hahaha
4/2/16, 15:22 - Mom: not, u shud teach him to manage own finance properly at his very young age
4/2/16, 15:24 - Cindy L: Dw I didn't buy a fish
4/2/16, 15:25 - Mom: we have never succeed in breeding fish for like a week or month
4/2/16, 15:25 - Cindy L: I had a neon tetra for like three weeks
4/2/16, 15:26 - Mom: ok, three weeks
4/2/16, 15:26 - Mom: good result
4/2/16, 15:26 - Mom: üëç
4/2/16, 15:26 - Cindy L: It lived out of a coke bottle
4/2/16, 15:28 - Cindy L: I wonder if any sane, proper property owner would actually rent thwir house out to uni students really.
4/2/16, 15:29 - Mom: ei, lots of property owner will do that cuz they always thought uni students r good tenants
4/2/16, 15:29 - Mom: they don't even realize that there're lots of weird uni students in this whole wide world
4/2/16, 15:29 - Mom: so r they sane or insane?
4/2/16, 15:29 - Cindy L: I would expect uni students to be the kind of tenants to destroy my house
4/2/16, 15:29 - Mom: but for me, i def won't
4/2/16, 15:30 - Mom: hahaha
4/2/16, 15:30 - Cindy L: Like the Taiwanese guy
4/2/16, 15:30 - Mom: yea
4/2/16, 15:30 - Mom: so terrible
4/2/16, 15:31 - Cindy L: The worst thing is when u don't clean, u will attract pests and get an infestation
4/2/16, 15:31 - Mom: but tbh, we're exceptional
4/2/16, 15:31 - Mom: we keep our house so clean and tidy
4/2/16, 15:31 - Cindy L: Er my Russian neighbour is really clean too
4/2/16, 15:32 - Mom: oh rlly
4/2/16, 15:32 - Mom: franking speaking, most asians don't have clean and tidy concept
4/2/16, 15:32 - Cindy L: Yea the Singaporean guys vacuum like once a week and one of them wipes the floor too
4/2/16, 15:32 - Mom: even those so-called well-educated chinese
4/2/16, 15:33 - Cindy L: Actually I think the white people tend to be more messy.....
4/2/16, 15:33 - Mom: don't know
4/2/16, 15:34 - Cindy L: I dunno really depends on the person
4/2/16, 15:34 - Cindy L: That's why choosing a tenant is hard
4/2/16, 15:34 - Emos: if ur tidy then ur tidy
4/2/16, 15:34 - Cindy L: I would imagine most people don't like to live in pig stys
4/2/16, 15:34 - Cindy L: But I was wronf
4/2/16, 15:35 - Cindy L: Wrong
4/2/16, 15:35 - Mom: but they don't think theirs r pig stys
4/2/16, 15:35 - Emos: pigsty
4/2/16, 15:35 - Cindy L: A pig sty is a pig sty
4/2/16, 15:36 - Cindy L: Pigsty
4/2/16, 15:36 - Mom: typo
4/2/16, 15:37 - Cindy L: Thank God we don't hv to clean the bathroom
4/2/16, 15:38 - Mom: very dirty?
4/2/16, 15:39 - Cindy L: I mean if the cleaner didn't do it, then there would probably be algae growing in there
4/2/16, 15:39 - Cindy L: By now
4/2/16, 15:39 - Mom: lol
4/2/16, 18:27 - Cindy L: Dude I just took a nap around 1715
4/2/16, 18:29 - Cindy L: And I had this weird dream where I was in different house with u guys cuz apparently u moved again
4/2/16, 18:29 - Cindy L: And then when I woke up I tried to recall where the hell I was again and I couldnt
4/2/16, 18:30 - Cindy L: Like yesterday
4/2/16, 18:39 - Mom: how long u nap?
4/2/16, 18:39 - Cindy L: Woke up at 1750
4/2/16, 18:40 - Cindy L: So abt half an hr
4/2/16, 18:40 - Mom: so it's abt 45 mins
4/2/16, 18:40 - Mom: no 35 mins
4/2/16, 18:40 - Cindy L: Yarh üòí
4/2/16, 18:41 - Mom: where do u think u were at the time u woke up from nap?
4/2/16, 18:41 - Cindy L: Hurrr I don't know
4/2/16, 18:41 - Cindy L: I just started thinking where the hell am I? And then I couldn't find the answer to that question
4/2/16, 18:41 - Mom: u said u tried to recall where u were?
4/2/16, 18:42 - Mom: don't recognize ur at ur dorm?
4/2/16, 18:42 - Cindy L: No I hadn't looked around yet
4/2/16, 18:42 - Cindy L: I napped face down on the desk, so I was still facing the desk
4/2/16, 18:43 - Mom: ic, so when u looked around again, u do know that ur at ur dorm right?
4/2/16, 18:43 - Cindy L: Yea
4/2/16, 18:43 - Cindy L: Momentary disorientation
4/2/16, 18:43 - Mom: is this case only happen at the time when u woke up from sleep/nap?
4/2/16, 18:44 - Cindy L: Seems like only naps so far
4/2/16, 18:44 - Mom: usually had dreams?
4/2/16, 18:44 - Cindy L: Yar
4/2/16, 18:45 - Cindy L: This is the feeling when my dream leaks into consciousness
4/2/16, 18:45 - Mom: will that be the case that ur mindset is still with ur dream situation, didn't come back yet?
4/2/16, 18:45 - Cindy L: U guys were living in a new house near wongtaisin
4/2/16, 18:45 - Mom: how do u know it's near wongtaisin?
4/2/16, 18:46 - Cindy L: Cuz I had a moment in the dream where I tried to locate myself as well
4/2/16, 18:46 - Cindy L: I thought it was the regular house at first until I noticed everything was different
4/2/16, 18:46 - Mom: and how can u tell/locate urself at wongtaisin?
4/2/16, 18:46 - Mom: road sign?
4/2/16, 18:47 - Cindy L: Er cuz we all went out and walked to the nearest mtr
4/2/16, 18:47 - Mom: or u can recognise those buildings around?
4/2/16, 18:47 - Cindy L: Which is wongtaisin
4/2/16, 18:47 - Mom: where were we b4?
4/2/16, 18:47 - Cindy L: What before we went out?
4/2/16, 18:47 - Mom: yea
4/2/16, 18:48 - Cindy L: In the house
4/2/16, 18:48 - Mom: i mean where that house is located? and how can u tell?
4/2/16, 18:48 - Mom: how's the interior of that house? big/small/newly refurnished or old?
4/2/16, 18:48 - Cindy L: I don't know exactly where located but I guessed that it was somewhere in wongtaisin cuz we walked to the MTR station
4/2/16, 18:49 - Cindy L: Bigger?
4/2/16, 18:49 - Cindy L: It had wooden floora
4/2/16, 18:49 - Cindy L: Flooring
4/2/16, 18:49 - Cindy L: I thought it was laguna at first
4/2/16, 18:49 - Cindy L: But then the doors are paint in pale lilac
4/2/16, 18:50 - Mom: it's weird, cuz we had never lived around wongtaisin, and we seldom go to that area  whether for shopping or dinner?
4/2/16, 18:51 - Mom: i'm rather confident that those vision r just created/made from u memories
4/2/16, 18:51 - Cindy L: They built new buildings there recently
4/2/16, 18:51 - Cindy L: From what I heard
4/2/16, 18:52 - Cindy L: I'm in a coffee shop now cuz my head started hurting
4/2/16, 18:52 - Cindy L: after I woke up.
4/2/16, 18:53 - Cindy L: And before I fell alseep I was watching econ lecture and my left hand started itching a lot.
4/2/16, 18:53 - Mom: does it mean u that do have stress/anxiety abt our frequent moving house issue?
4/2/16, 18:53 - Cindy L: Not really I don't know
4/2/16, 18:54 - Cindy L: Anyways my left hand started itching
4/2/16, 18:54 - Cindy L: And I knew it wasn't coming from my hand cuz I couldn't locate where the itch was
4/2/16, 18:54 - Mom: ofc, ur face down on the desk, it's difficult to breathe in oxgyen
4/2/16, 18:54 - Cindy L: Maybe
4/2/16, 18:54 - Cindy L: Fair point
4/2/16, 18:55 - Mom: not from ur hand, then the itchy feeling from where?
4/2/16, 18:55 - Cindy L: It probably came from my head
4/2/16, 18:55 - Cindy L: U know like the kind where u can't seem to scratch it
4/2/16, 18:55 - Cindy L: I nearly destroyed my finger.
4/2/16, 18:56 - Mom: besides, as ur face down on ur desk, ur spine is suffering from a lot of pressure that makes u feel uncomfortable
4/2/16, 18:56 - Cindy L: That's how the patch on my middle finger came to be
4/2/16, 18:56 - Mom: how destroy ur finger?
4/2/16, 18:56 - Cindy L: Like I kept scratch it
4/2/16, 18:56 - Cindy L: Scratching
4/2/16, 18:56 - Mom: how's it now?
4/2/16, 18:56 - Cindy L: But I couldn't stop the itch
4/2/16, 18:56 - Mom: broken?
4/2/16, 18:56 - Cindy L: It's okay
4/2/16, 18:57 - Cindy L: Cuz I knew what was happening
4/2/16, 18:58 - Mom: u mean itchy feeling from ur head, ofc it's ur nerves telling u that u feel pain or itchy, not ur arm/finger itself
4/2/16, 18:58 - Cindy L: No that's not what I mean
4/2/16, 18:59 - Cindy L: It's like a different kind of itch
4/2/16, 18:59 - Cindy L: Like it's deep under the skin
4/2/16, 18:59 - Mom: so the physical itchy point is ur finger/arm or ur head?
4/2/16, 19:00 - Cindy L: The hand is the target
4/2/16, 19:00 - Cindy L: But the itch is generated in the brain
4/2/16, 19:00 - Cindy L: Actually I don't even know where normal itchy feeling originates from....ü§î
4/2/16, 19:01 - Mom: ofc originated from ur nerve at the brain
4/2/16, 19:01 - Cindy L: But why do u scratch that point
4/2/16, 19:01 - Cindy L: It makes me want to tear off my limb
4/2/16, 19:02 - Cindy L: If it's very itchy
4/2/16, 19:02 - Cindy L: That's why I start cracking my joints and moving my muscles.
4/2/16, 19:02 - Mom: ur arm/finger is the weak point where ur skin is broken and having numerous while blood cell doing remedial works
4/2/16, 19:03 - Cindy L: But my finger wasn't broken before I scratched it
4/2/16, 19:03 - Mom: but more scratching only makes ur itchy feeling even stronger
4/2/16, 19:03 - Cindy L: Er that's not true.
4/2/16, 19:03 - Mom: u don't know what's happening underneath ur skin right?
4/2/16, 19:03 - Cindy L: Normal itching u scratch it and it goes away
4/2/16, 19:03 - Mom: no
4/2/16, 19:03 - Cindy L: Like say if u had an itch on ur butt
4/2/16, 19:04 - Cindy L: U don't scratch ur butt forever
4/2/16, 19:04 - Mom: def not, whenever i scratch my itchy point, i want ot scratch even more until a point where i told myself to stop
4/2/16, 19:04 - Mom: otherwise, i just keep scratching more and more
4/2/16, 19:05 - Cindy L: Er no for me there's more itch where I scratch a few times and it goes away
4/2/16, 19:05 - Cindy L: And then there's eczema itch which is purely destructive
4/2/16, 19:06 - Mom: this is the eczema's power
4/2/16, 19:06 - Cindy L: I mean think about it, it hurts to break skin but the itch is so bad the patient would destroy it until it bleeds
4/2/16, 19:06 - Cindy L: Now I think abt it u don't feel pain until afterwards
4/2/16, 19:06 - Cindy L: Hmmm
4/2/16, 19:07 - Cindy L: If u cut itself with a knife, it hurts the moment u cut it right
4/2/16, 19:09 - Cindy L: The itchy sensation is definitely different
4/2/16, 19:09 - Cindy L: That's why creaming doesn't really work.
4/2/16, 19:09 - Cindy L: Hmmü§î
4/2/16, 19:10 - Mom: rmb that, feeling itchy is one of the five sense, so it must be ur brain telling u that ur finger/arm has something wrong with it through ur nerve
4/2/16, 19:11 - Mom: but if u keep scratching so hardly, ur just damaging ur skin which bring u another form of sensation, like pain
4/2/16, 19:12 - Mom: so the optimum solution to help ur skin heal is to control scratching alot
4/2/16, 19:13 - Mom: putting cream on ur skin ofc can't mositurizer ur skin directly but those creams can act as a protection on ur skin and temporary hydrating purpose
4/2/16, 19:14 - Mom: at the end of the day, ur skin need to be completely healed
4/2/16, 19:46 - Cindy L: No that's what doctors imagine eczema is like
4/2/16, 19:47 - Cindy L: Its itchy cuz ur body is inflammed
4/2/16, 19:47 - Cindy L: Inflammation would cause a sustained itch
4/2/16, 19:47 - Cindy L: The whole point of creaming is to relieve the dryness which doctors believed to be the cause of itching
4/2/16, 19:47 - Cindy L: But it's not
4/2/16, 19:48 - Cindy L: The scratching is not voluntary
4/2/16, 19:49 - Mom: I just thought something is getting a prob under ur skin b4 it's inflammed
4/2/16, 19:49 - Mom: I can't agree that creaming can moisturize ur skin
4/2/16, 19:50 - Cindy L: It's doesn't but that is the intended effect right
4/2/16, 19:50 - Cindy L: And yea the problem under the skin is inflammation
4/2/16, 19:51 - Cindy L: Cuz if u think about it, the inflammation happens before u destroy by scratching
4/2/16, 19:51 - Cindy L: The skin becomes hot before u even do anything to it
4/2/16, 19:52 - Cindy L: Inflammation also provides the ideal conditions for cell mutation
4/2/16, 19:53 - Cindy L: Which if u look at eczema skin, the way the skin heals and even the texture is different to normal skin
4/2/16, 19:55 - Cindy L: So now we know that before I fell asleep my body was going through some sort of inflammation
4/2/16, 19:55 - Mom: ....
4/2/16, 19:55 - Cindy L: Which explains why my head started hurting after I woke up
4/2/16, 19:58 - Cindy L: I am becoming more convinced that my cataplexy was triggered by some autoimmune thing.
4/2/16, 19:58 - Mom: It's ur arm feeling itchy, why ur head hurt?
4/2/16, 19:59 - Cindy L: After I woke up I my head didnt feel so good so I went out
4/2/16, 19:59 - Mom: Better after goiny out?
4/2/16, 20:00 - Cindy L: Er yeah I suppose
4/2/16, 20:00 - Cindy L: But I also had a coffee
4/2/16, 20:01 - Mom: So u think ur cataplexy is triggered by ur eczema?
4/2/16, 20:05 - Cindy L: No I think I hv an underlying autoimmune disorder
4/2/16, 20:06 - Cindy L: Hmmm. Cell bio is more difficult to understand
4/3/16, 09:34 - Mom: hello, good morning good morning good morning to u
4/3/16, 09:34 - Mom: ‚è±

4/3/16, 12:41 - Cindy L: I was gonna have to change all my passwords
4/3/16, 12:41 - Mom: the previous one looks scary
4/3/16, 12:42 - Cindy L: Yah ok

4/3/16, 12:44 - Cindy L: .....
4/3/16, 12:44 - Cindy L: I need to take a touristy photo
4/3/16, 12:45 - Mom: why? for what?
4/3/16, 12:45 - Cindy L: Because that's what peeps use as sp

4/3/16, 12:51 - Mom: do u rmb how long the warranty is?
4/3/16, 12:51 - Mom: 1 yr or 3 yrs?
4/3/16, 12:54 - Cindy L: Uno
4/3/16, 12:54 - Cindy L: 1 I think
4/3/16, 12:54 - Cindy L: How can u access my fb account btw?
4/3/16, 12:54 - Mom: u had ur login all the time
4/3/16, 12:55 - Mom: is that the mic prob or sound card prob?
4/3/16, 12:55 - Mom: did i give u ur computer 's invoice details?
4/3/16, 12:56 - Mom: i rmb that we've asked the salesman at fortress that abt the warranty in uk
4/3/16, 12:56 - Mom: if it's still under warranty, u can bring that laptop to hp service centre for repair
4/3/16, 12:57 - Cindy L: Soundcard I think
4/3/16, 12:57 - Mom: will those invoices in ur dropbox or files?
4/3/16, 12:57 - Cindy L: If I just restart it it goes away
4/3/16, 12:57 - Cindy L: Yes I hv all the warranty docs
4/3/16, 12:57 - Mom: still under warranty now?
4/3/16, 12:57 - Cindy L: Will check
4/3/16, 12:58 - Cindy L: The thing is if I restart it, the problem is fixed
4/3/16, 12:58 - Mom: have u dropped ur laptop?
4/3/16, 12:58 - Cindy L: No
4/3/16, 12:59 - Mom: if u restart it, the prob fixed, then it shud probably be the software prob, right?
4/3/16, 13:03 - Cindy L: Yes hence the sound card
4/3/16, 13:03 - Mom: if it's still under warranty, why don't get it checked to see if there's any prob?
4/3/16, 13:04 - Cindy L: Sure
4/3/16, 13:04 - Cindy L: If I find the time to
4/3/16, 13:05 - Mom: kk
4/3/16, 13:05 - Cindy L: Ill take it there √†nd then there will be nothing wrong with it once again
4/3/16, 13:05 - Cindy L: U know u can borrow macbook airs from the lse library
4/3/16, 13:05 - Mom: how long the prob's there?
4/3/16, 13:06 - Mom: don't know
4/3/16, 13:06 - Cindy L: Hurr depends
4/3/16, 13:06 - Mom: then don't have to buy computer anyway?
4/3/16, 13:06 - Cindy L: I dunno like I said, it comes and goes
4/3/16, 13:06 - Cindy L: Yah I guess. Actually u dont
4/3/16, 13:06 - Mom: but it's annoying if that prob persists and can't be fixed
4/3/16, 13:06 - Cindy L: Cuz they hv to cater for poor students as well
4/3/16, 13:06 - Mom: good policy
4/3/16, 13:07 - Mom: but who wud be those poor student in lse?
4/3/16, 13:07 - Cindy L: Imperial actually gives u a laptop though
4/3/16, 13:07 - Cindy L: Not as much here
4/3/16, 13:07 - Cindy L: Ucl actually has poor students
4/3/16, 13:07 - Mom: no, imperial also lent them to students only
4/3/16, 13:08 - Mom: but after 4 yrs, those computers wud have to be scrap
4/3/16, 13:08 - Cindy L: No ur given one I'm sure
4/3/16, 13:08 - Cindy L: Narumi said they gave it to her
4/3/16, 13:08 - Mom: wow, so good
4/3/16, 13:08 - Mom: but their skl fee is skyrocketing
4/3/16, 13:09 - Cindy L: But they do more tech work
4/3/16, 13:09 - Mom: 10,000 pp more expensive
4/3/16, 13:09 - Cindy L: Yah
4/3/16, 13:09 - Cindy L: I could buy a laptop with thay
4/3/16, 13:09 - Mom: they charge more than ucl for same discipline
4/3/16, 13:09 - Cindy L: Yea
4/3/16, 13:09 - Cindy L: But ucl mechanic eng is not as good
4/3/16, 13:10 - Mom: 10,000 pp can buy u 10 more computers
4/3/16, 13:10 - Cindy L: Ucl dumps all its resources into med and biological disciplines
4/3/16, 13:10 - Cindy L: Ucl and kcl are actually top unis for med.
4/3/16, 13:10 - Mom: tbh, who cares whether it's no.1 or no.5 in uk ranking
4/3/16, 13:10 - Cindy L: Yah it's the Dept which matters
4/3/16, 13:11 - Cindy L: Cuz it means how much resources u get
4/3/16, 13:11 - Mom: most important is that u can get a reasonable good earnings
4/3/16, 13:11 - Mom: after graduation
4/3/16, 13:11 - Cindy L: Hurrt
4/3/16, 13:11 - Cindy L: I would still apply imperial first and ucl second for mech eng or similar eng subjects
4/3/16, 13:12 - Mom: sometimes, grad from elite uni doesn't always make u earn a better offer
4/3/16, 13:12 - Mom: mech eng if useless
4/3/16, 13:12 - Cindy L: We r talking abt totally different things now
4/3/16, 13:12 - Mom: no conflict
4/3/16, 13:12 - Cindy L: Lol
4/3/16, 13:13 - Mom: afterall, u still have to earn a living
4/3/16, 13:13 - Cindy L: Yeah but u won't starve as an engineer
4/3/16, 13:13 - Mom: maybe
4/3/16, 13:13 - Cindy L: Like wat
4/3/16, 13:13 - Mom: but in uk, i rlly doubt the prospect of being an enger
4/3/16, 13:13 - Cindy L: Hmm not sure
4/3/16, 13:14 - Cindy L: I know quite a few engineers
4/3/16, 13:14 - Mom: uk's policy on stem is a failure
4/3/16, 13:14 - Cindy L: That's true
4/3/16, 13:14 - Cindy L: Did u hear abt the steel crisis
4/3/16, 13:14 - Mom: how's their works?
4/3/16, 13:14 - Mom: good or bad?
4/3/16, 13:15 - Cindy L: What works?
4/3/16, 13:15 - Mom: ur engr friends' work?
4/3/16, 13:15 - Cindy L: Oh
4/3/16, 13:15 - Cindy L: Imperial is death as usual
4/3/16, 13:15 - Mom: steel crisis? what?
4/3/16, 13:15 - Cindy L: The other one goes to Surrey so I don't know
4/3/16, 13:16 - Cindy L: Steel crisis
4/3/16, 13:16 - Mom: shortage? or too much?
4/3/16, 13:16 - Cindy L: The Tories imported a lot of poor quality Chinese steel
4/3/16, 13:16 - Mom: tories r stupid
4/3/16, 13:16 - Cindy L: And the UK steel industry suffered cuz of that
4/3/16, 13:16 - Mom: get close to china is committing suicide
4/3/16, 13:16 - Cindy L: So now they hv angry steel workers and no steel
4/3/16, 13:17 - Mom: oh, i read that steel news, now i rmb
4/3/16, 13:17 - Cindy L: Yah even I start reading the news
4/3/16, 13:18 - Mom: Cameron govt is putting uk economy to dead
4/3/16, 13:18 - Mom: even hope to earn chinese yuan
4/3/16, 13:18 - Cindy L: Also meanwhile Americans hv a shortage of doctors soon
4/3/16, 13:18 - Cindy L: Which is good news
4/3/16, 13:18 - Mom: just a big jok
4/3/16, 13:19 - Mom: but u can't probably to get admitted to us med skl, i doubt
4/3/16, 13:19 - Mom: *be
4/3/16, 13:19 - Cindy L: They do admit
4/3/16, 13:19 - Mom: oh rlly?
4/3/16, 13:19 - Mom: good
4/3/16, 13:19 - Cindy L: Like a very small percentage
4/3/16, 13:19 - Cindy L: It's like getting into Harvard and mit
4/3/16, 13:19 - Cindy L: Lol
4/3/16, 13:20 - Mom: anyway, it's 3 yrs later
4/3/16, 13:20 - Cindy L: Anyways I wouldn't be a doctor
4/3/16, 13:20 - Mom: perhaps by that time, u'll become american
4/3/16, 13:20 - Cindy L: Apparently they abuse u in med schl
4/3/16, 13:20 - Mom: what abuse?
4/3/16, 13:20 - Cindy L: So my two cents is
4/3/16, 13:20 - Mom: how?
4/3/16, 13:21 - Cindy L: There r so many suicides
4/3/16, 13:21 - Cindy L: In med school
4/3/16, 13:21 - Mom: make med students be slaves?
4/3/16, 13:21 - Cindy L: There was a Ted talk on tedmed abt it
4/3/16, 13:21 - Mom: perhaps, that's the pressure
4/3/16, 13:21 - Cindy L: It's the environment
4/3/16, 13:21 - Mom: anyway, doing med isn't easy
4/3/16, 13:22 - Mom: u got lots of things to learn and memories
4/3/16, 13:22 - Cindy L: It's not just that
4/3/16, 13:22 - Mom: memorize
4/3/16, 13:22 - Cindy L: It's competitive
4/3/16, 13:22 - Cindy L: People don't sleep
4/3/16, 13:22 - Cindy L: Profs arent helpful
4/3/16, 13:22 - Cindy L: That shit
4/3/16, 13:22 - Mom: chi seeen
4/3/16, 13:23 - Cindy L: And then when u get into hospital
4/3/16, 13:23 - Cindy L: Lots of internal politics
4/3/16, 13:23 - Cindy L: No good mental health at the end of four years
4/3/16, 13:24 - Mom: then better be a wolf at the wall street
4/3/16, 13:24 - Mom: at least u earn big money
4/3/16, 13:24 - Cindy L: Er that's not good either
4/3/16, 13:24 - Cindy L: Ibank well known for working u to death
4/3/16, 13:24 - Cindy L: Anyways u earn big money as doctor too
4/3/16, 13:24 - Mom: but the tenant we have at seymour place is still alive
4/3/16, 13:25 - Cindy L: That's true üòÇ
4/3/16, 13:25 - Cindy L: But he's indian
4/3/16, 13:25 - Cindy L: So hard to get in lah
4/3/16, 13:25 - Mom: no, ibanker earn big big big big money in relatively short time than the drs
4/3/16, 13:25 - Mom: indian is better to survive in ibank?
4/3/16, 13:26 - Mom: i don't think so
4/3/16, 13:26 - Mom: but he's lucky that he works in a swiss bank
4/3/16, 13:26 - Cindy L: Indian get along with the white people more easily
4/3/16, 13:26 - Cindy L: White people r fucking racist and sexist
4/3/16, 13:26 - Mom: that's true
4/3/16, 13:26 - Mom: tru too
4/3/16, 13:26 - Cindy L: U know what the best job is
4/3/16, 13:27 - Cindy L: Work in medium size firm
4/3/16, 13:27 - Cindy L: They are very chill
4/3/16, 13:27 - Cindy L: Well they tend to be very chill
4/3/16, 13:27 - Cindy L: As long as u get ur projects done
4/3/16, 13:27 - Mom: but medium size firm can afford to hire elite uni grad
4/3/16, 13:28 - Cindy L: Yah
4/3/16, 13:28 - Mom: no, it depends on ur boss if he/she is a normal guy
4/3/16, 13:28 - Mom: medium or small firms also have crazy shit
4/3/16, 13:29 - Cindy L: There was this guy who graduated and still comes back to society meetings
4/3/16, 13:29 - Mom: and most ppl working in medium size or small firms r stupid
4/3/16, 13:29 - Mom: who?
4/3/16, 13:29 - Cindy L: And he worked in some firm which dealt with exports and imports and they r super chill
4/3/16, 13:29 - Mom: can't find a job?
4/3/16, 13:30 - Cindy L: Dude if u don't get into big 4 u still need a job üòë
4/3/16, 13:30 - Cindy L: Big4 and ib are not guaranteed u know
4/3/16, 13:30 - Mom: ofc i know
4/3/16, 13:30 - Mom: u think i never have worked b4?
4/3/16, 13:31 - Cindy L: No u sound surprise that someone from lse work in a medium firm
4/3/16, 13:32 - Mom: even if u can go into big 4 or ib, normally u can only stay there for several yrs after grad, after that u'll get out and get another more secure com
4/3/16, 13:33 - Cindy L: I see
4/3/16, 13:33 - Cindy L: Well explains the high turn over
4/3/16, 13:33 - Mom: cuz competition for senior post is rigorous
4/3/16, 13:33 - Mom: yea, just early career training skl
4/3/16, 13:33 - Cindy L: Basically it's not a good time for finance right now
4/3/16, 13:34 - Mom: sigh....
4/3/16, 13:34 - Cindy L: My two cents is
4/3/16, 13:34 - Mom: economic down turn ma
4/3/16, 13:34 - Cindy L: The best is bioengineering that sort of stuff
4/3/16, 13:34 - Mom: perhaps
4/3/16, 13:34 - Cindy L: Cuz ppl are pouring money into cancer research and immunology
4/3/16, 13:34 - Cindy L: Very easy to get funds for those
4/3/16, 13:35 - Mom: they need to
4/3/16, 13:35 - Cindy L: And computer science and data management
4/3/16, 13:35 - Mom: cuz those r only the researches that can convince govt to put money into
4/3/16, 13:35 - Cindy L: Yea for now
4/3/16, 13:36 - Mom: health industry always attracts lots of money
4/3/16, 13:36 - Cindy L: And pharmaceuticals
4/3/16, 13:36 - Cindy L: So chem eng is still not bad
4/3/16, 13:36 - Mom: comp sci and data mgt probably get funds from private investors
4/3/16, 13:36 - Cindy L: Very versatile
4/3/16, 13:36 - Mom: sigh....
4/3/16, 13:36 - Cindy L: Yea comp sci is good for startup
4/3/16, 13:36 - Mom: u know why chem  is a must???
4/3/16, 13:37 - Cindy L: Er yeah
4/3/16, 13:37 - Cindy L: But it's not like I could hv predicted how the world was gonna go
4/3/16, 13:38 - Mom: i think the prob is that u haven't rlly think of the job prob
4/3/16, 13:38 - Mom: cuz ur not in need of money
4/3/16, 13:38 - Cindy L: Impossible for me to do so, there was nothing to base my choices on
4/3/16, 13:38 - Cindy L: Nothing to think about
4/3/16, 13:38 - Cindy L: It's not a matter of money
4/3/16, 13:39 - Mom: why?
4/3/16, 13:39 - Mom: ppl used to choose subj based on career choice
4/3/16, 13:39 - Cindy L: Because money is a temporary is a temporary state
4/3/16, 13:39 - Mom: if u know what to do in the future, u wud know what subj to choose
4/3/16, 13:39 - Cindy L: And u don't know which subj is gonna make a lot of money in the future
4/3/16, 13:40 - Cindy L: No the only way u know what to do right now is if u hv future goals
4/3/16, 13:40 - Mom: u don't need to know what job can earn u big money
4/3/16, 13:40 - Cindy L: And to make a lot of money is not a future goal
4/3/16, 13:40 - Cindy L: It doesn't make sense
4/3/16, 13:40 - Mom: just know what ur going to do after grad, that's enough
4/3/16, 13:41 - Cindy L: Why r we still talking abt this
4/3/16, 13:41 - Mom: yea, ur right, u don't to set ur goal as earning big money
4/3/16, 13:41 - Mom: but u've to know what ur going to do?
4/3/16, 13:41 - Cindy L: U can always make a lot of money if u're determined.
4/3/16, 13:41 - Mom: okok, no more money talk
4/3/16, 13:42 - Cindy L: I mean it's not hard
4/3/16, 13:42 - Mom: the main point is u just pick the subj u love and take a career on that subj
4/3/16, 13:42 - Cindy L: Just save.
4/3/16, 13:42 - Cindy L: Invest
4/3/16, 13:42 - Cindy L: Keep ur wealth circulating
4/3/16, 13:43 - Cindy L: Cuz wealth is a flow
4/3/16, 13:43 - Cindy L: Actually now I think abt it u don't even need money....
4/3/16, 13:43 - Mom: yea, but ur first job still can earn a reasonably good amount of money, so that u can have savings after daily expenses right
4/3/16, 13:44 - Cindy L: Look at Americans, massive debt and still consuming a lot
4/3/16, 13:44 - Mom: like what donald trump said: if ur going to broke, get it big
4/3/16, 13:45 - Mom: but who wud grant big credit to someone with low creditabiltiy?
4/3/16, 13:45 - Cindy L: Like my flatmate always say
4/3/16, 13:46 - Cindy L: Find yourself a sugarmama
4/3/16, 13:46 - Cindy L: Hahahaha
4/3/16, 13:46 - Mom: good idea
4/3/16, 13:46 - Mom: üëç
4/3/16, 13:46 - Cindy L: Lol answer to ur who would grant big credit to someone with low credit score
4/3/16, 13:46 - Cindy L: Subprime mortgages
4/3/16, 13:46 - Mom: like wendy deng
4/3/16, 13:46 - Cindy L: Hahahaha
4/3/16, 13:47 - Mom: subprime is not good solution
4/3/16, 13:47 - Mom: üëé
4/3/16, 13:47 - Cindy L: Ofc but it is a bit hilarious
4/3/16, 13:47 - Cindy L: Why the hell did they legalize that
4/3/16, 13:48 - Mom: who knows?
4/3/16, 13:48 - Cindy L: Macro is indeed more fun than micro
4/3/16, 13:48 - Mom: macro is much more difficult
4/3/16, 13:48 - Cindy L: Yah I guess. Cuz its not just drawing demand and supply graphs
4/3/16, 13:49 - Mom: do u know china just impose heavy duties on uk's imported steel
4/3/16, 13:50 - Cindy L: Lol
4/3/16, 13:50 - Mom: Cameron's like being slapped
4/3/16, 13:50 - Cindy L: He just wants the nuclear plant
4/3/16, 13:51 - Mom: i think he's going to be cheated again
4/3/16, 13:51 - Cindy L: Oh well
4/3/16, 13:51 - Cindy L: What good does ppe do then
4/3/16, 13:52 - Mom: i think the result wud be like this: lots of chinese immigrants in uk labor force with a low quality or even unsafe nuclear plant
4/3/16, 13:53 - Mom: ppe course is for academic only, not the real world in china
4/3/16, 13:53 - Mom: don't u see that all chinese leaders do engrg deg?
4/3/16, 13:55 - Cindy L: Cuz they don't hv many courses abt asia
4/3/16, 15:21 - Cindy L: So I forgot to update u
4/3/16, 15:21 - Cindy L: But I slept at 2
4/3/16, 15:21 - Cindy L: And then woke up at 8:30
4/3/16, 15:21 - Cindy L: Wait I woke up at 0530 first
4/3/16, 15:21 - Cindy L: And then I woke at 0830
4/3/16, 15:22 - Cindy L: Then I went back to sleep round 0930
4/3/16, 15:22 - Cindy L: Then I woke up at 11
4/3/16, 15:23 - Cindy L: I got up and had pancakes
4/3/16, 15:23 - Cindy L: And then I took at nap at 1400 cuz my brain was tired from playing a programming game.
4/3/16, 15:24 - Cindy L: Shows I cant think too hard
4/3/16, 15:24 - Cindy L: And I woke up at 1500
4/3/16, 15:24 - Cindy L: Having lunch now
4/3/16, 15:25 - Cindy L: ‚úåüèª
4/3/16, 15:25 - Cindy L: There's not enough hours in a day
4/3/16, 15:55 - Mom: did u do anything between 0530 to 0830?
4/3/16, 15:57 - Mom: nap from 1400 to 1500?
4/3/16, 15:58 - Mom: try to push ur sleep schedule earlier
4/3/16, 18:58 - Cindy L: Yea sleep
4/3/16, 18:58 - Cindy L: Sorry I napped a lot today
4/3/16, 18:59 - Mom: rlly tired or just nothing motivated, then sleep?
4/3/16, 19:01 - Cindy L: Tired I guess?
4/3/16, 19:01 - Cindy L: I ate something baf
4/3/16, 19:01 - Cindy L: B
4/3/16, 19:01 - Cindy L: Bad
4/3/16, 19:01 - Mom: what?
4/3/16, 19:01 - Mom: ice cream?
4/3/16, 19:01 - Cindy L: I made vegetables pork and vermicelli
4/3/16, 19:01 - Cindy L: Stir fry
4/3/16, 19:02 - Cindy L: And I get a lot of gas
4/3/16, 19:02 - Cindy L: I put garlic yesterday so I thought it was that
4/3/16, 19:02 - Cindy L: So today I omit the garlic
4/3/16, 19:02 - Cindy L: Same thing.
4/3/16, 19:02 - Mom: okay, could it be other ingredients?
4/3/16, 19:02 - Mom: like drink?
4/3/16, 19:03 - Cindy L: I didn't drink anything
4/3/16, 19:03 - Mom: oil?
4/3/16, 19:03 - Cindy L: Maybe sesame oil
4/3/16, 19:03 - Mom: ate too much?
4/3/16, 19:03 - Cindy L: No
4/3/16, 19:03 - Cindy L: U can't eat too much veggies
4/3/16, 19:03 - Mom: did u put sesame oil both days?
4/3/16, 19:03 - Cindy L: Yea
4/3/16, 19:04 - Cindy L: It's probably sesame
4/3/16, 19:04 - Mom: next time try to eliminate sesame oil to see if that's the cause
4/3/16, 19:04 - Mom: btw, stir fry is oily
4/3/16, 19:04 - Cindy L: Yea but I use olive oil
4/3/16, 19:04 - Mom: if u've gas, that means u can't digest something properly
4/3/16, 19:05 - Mom: olive oil might still be difficult to digest
4/3/16, 19:05 - Cindy L: No way
4/3/16, 19:05 - Mom: cuz ur gut is rlly problematic
4/3/16, 19:05 - Cindy L: Hahaha that's like saying avocados r hard to digest
4/3/16, 19:06 - Mom: maybe, ur missing something in ur gut that helps in digestion
4/3/16, 19:06 - Mom: that's why u always have lots of gas or bloating stomach right?
4/3/16, 19:06 - Cindy L: But plant fats are really easy to digest
4/3/16, 19:07 - Cindy L: So it's probably not the oil
4/3/16, 19:07 - Cindy L: And I didbt add a lot
4/3/16, 19:07 - Mom: what if ur gut is missing some important micro-organisms which help digestion?
4/3/16, 19:08 - Cindy L: Aiyaha I don't knkw
4/3/16, 19:08 - Cindy L: But I just cooked with normal ingredients as usual
4/3/16, 19:09 - Cindy L: Except for sesame oil so it's likely to be that
4/3/16, 19:09 - Mom: wud that be the vermicelli?
4/3/16, 19:33 - Cindy L: No it's the mung bean typw
4/3/16, 19:33 - Cindy L: U can buy it from jusco
4/3/16, 19:34 - Mom: What ru typing with?

4/4/16, 11:18 - Mom: oh, but if u get up at 10, it's still a good practice

4/4/16, 11:57 - Cindy L: Imma nap in the lib

4/4/16, 12:01 - Cindy L: Wow it should be there then
4/4/16, 12:02 - Cindy L: And letter is faster right?
4/4/16, 12:02 - Mom: theoretically, that letter shud be there, but we don't know if there's anything delay in the uk/us post office processing
4/4/16, 12:03 - Mom: so can't guarantee 7 days arrival
4/4/16, 12:03 - Cindy L: Kk but it's been two weeks
4/4/16, 12:03 - Cindy L: Don't tell me it's lost at sea.
4/4/16, 12:03 - Cindy L: üò±
4/4/16, 12:03 - Cindy L: It was so difficult to get that thing from my adviser
4/4/16, 12:04 - Mom: also, it takes time to be processed around different difficult sections when that mail arrives NU
4/4/16, 12:04 - Cindy L: Yea that's what I'm hoping it is including Easter delaya
4/4/16, 12:04 - Cindy L: Delays
4/4/16, 12:04 - Mom: that's why i don't understand why u didn't take copies or just ask ur advisor to email NU?
4/4/16, 12:05 - Mom: did u reply to NU's last email?
4/4/16, 12:05 - Cindy L: Cuz u need to fill in the college report offline
4/4/16, 12:05 - Cindy L: It's just that thibg
4/4/16, 12:05 - Cindy L: I don't even need an academic reference now cuz i paid KGV to do it
4/4/16, 12:06 - Mom: nvm, u shud reply to NU's last email telling them that ur missing items r coming through ordinary airmail, so they know u did have done ur work
4/4/16, 12:07 - Cindy L: Yaha doing so
4/4/16, 12:07 - Mom: if they still can't get that mail, they probably will notify u again
4/4/16, 12:08 - Mom: so u didn't have to wait until mail gone lost
4/4/16, 12:10 - Mom: okay, back to ur sleep, u said super tired, is that u dream alot that makes u unable to get energy or something related to ur inability to convert food to energy?

4/4/16, 15:45 - Mom: do u poo once everyday?
4/4/16, 15:45 - Mom: enough water?
4/4/16, 15:46 - Mom: cause the fibre might have clotted in ur intestine that makes u difficult to poo and the poo might be more dry and bigger, am i right?
4/4/16, 16:36 - Cindy L: Er no
4/4/16, 16:36 - Cindy L: It's like normal poop

4/5/16, 12:33 - Mom: unable to transmit msg to ur side
4/5/16, 13:35 - Cindy L: Oh hi
4/5/16, 13:36 - Cindy L: Sorry its the battery saving function
4/5/16, 13:36 - Cindy L: It turns off connectivity when the screen goes dark
4/5/16, 13:42 - Cindy L: I had a really creepy dream yesterday
4/5/16, 13:43 - Cindy L: For some reason I kept repeating that ghosts do not exist in my dream
4/5/16, 13:43 - Cindy L: And there was a storm
4/5/16, 13:43 - Cindy L: I was indoors
4/5/16, 13:43 - Cindy L: Doing normal stuff
4/5/16, 13:44 - Cindy L: But like whatever I did I kept hearing myself say ghosts do not exist
4/5/16, 13:44 - Cindy L: In canto
4/5/16, 13:59 - Cindy L: And then I had a brief moment of sleep paralysis on waking
4/5/16, 13:59 - Cindy L: I was conscious so I knew that if I didn't want to see creepy shit I needed to wake up
4/5/16, 14:00 - Mom: scary?
4/5/16, 14:00 - Mom: u never believe in supernatural thingy
4/5/16, 14:01 - Mom: why make that kind of dream?
4/5/16, 14:01 - Cindy L: I dunno
4/5/16, 14:01 - Cindy L: But dude it's scary if u hear something again and again
4/5/16, 14:01 - Cindy L: Like an omen
4/5/16, 14:02 - Mom: rlly heard something?
4/5/16, 14:03 - Mom: it so, then u must go to church to ask god's shelther
4/5/16, 14:03 - Mom: or u can go to temple to ask for chinese god's shelter
4/5/16, 14:03 - Cindy L: Then I kept the lights on and watched family guy until the sun came up
4/5/16, 14:04 - Mom: that's why u slept until noon these days
4/5/16, 14:04 - Mom: but that wud be detrimental to ur health
4/5/16, 14:05 - Mom: try to find a bible and put aside ur bed
4/5/16, 14:05 - Cindy L: No I haven't been having creepy dreams for a while.
4/5/16, 14:05 - Cindy L: That makes me more terrified. üòë
4/5/16, 14:05 - Cindy L: I just need to forget abt it.
4/5/16, 14:06 - Mom: okay, but i can feel ur scary emotion even over the internet
4/5/16, 14:07 - Mom: it's only one dream or u kept on repeating that same dream for the whole night?
4/5/16, 14:07 - Mom: and abt what time did u have that dream? just sleep or b4 wake up?
4/5/16, 14:08 - Cindy L: One dream
4/5/16, 14:08 - Cindy L: Kept repeating one phrase
4/5/16, 14:08 - Mom: and u said yesterday u saw a giant cockroach flying into ur room, is that real or just in ur dream?
4/5/16, 14:09 - Mom: who else in ur dream last night?
4/5/16, 14:11 - Cindy L: Abt the cockroach
4/5/16, 14:11 - Cindy L: When I become paralyzed
4/5/16, 14:11 - Cindy L: My eyes go funny
4/5/16, 14:11 - Cindy L: And my vision is distorted
4/5/16, 14:12 - Cindy L: So it's easy to mistake areas of movement
4/5/16, 14:12 - Cindy L: It was raining and I had the window open
4/5/16, 14:12 - Cindy L: So I looked at the brown suitcase
4/5/16, 14:12 - Cindy L: By the window
4/5/16, 14:12 - Cindy L: And I kept seeing this area of movement
4/5/16, 14:13 - Cindy L: So I thought there was a giant cochroach on the suitcase cuz its brown
4/5/16, 14:13 - Mom: so ur conscious at htat moment?
4/5/16, 14:14 - Mom: but why u become paralysis?
4/5/16, 14:14 - Mom: without any stimulant?
4/5/16, 14:15 - Mom: it seems that u become paralyzed b4 seeing the flying cockroach
4/5/16, 14:15 - Cindy L: Yah
4/5/16, 14:15 - Cindy L: But I can't remember what I was doing beforehand
4/5/16, 14:16 - Cindy L: Probably sleeping

4/5/16, 14:18 - Cindy L: Er I don't remember what I was doing
4/5/16, 14:19 - Cindy L: I just remember that there was a storm
4/5/16, 14:19 - Cindy L: Probably cuz I opened the windows and it was really windy outside
4/5/16, 14:19 - Cindy L: Apart from that, I was probably doing some really normal studd
4/5/16, 14:19 - Cindy L: Stuff

4/6/16, 13:53 - Cindy L: 1. to do with bugs, oh had to escape out of house in a forest. someone was spraying this gas thing which covered u in gnats which ate u alive, horrible.
4/6/16, 13:54 - Cindy L: and then giant bugs were hiding among the tree tops, so if u walked into a tree dense area u might get jumped by a giant bug
4/6/16, 13:54 - Cindy L: 2.
4/6/16, 13:55 - Cindy L: then i ended up in this candy place.
4/6/16, 13:55 - Cindy L: u know the kind of shop where u can pick the candies u like and u need to pay for them by weight?
4/6/16, 13:56 - Cindy L: yeah well i was shrunk down and crazy around the trays of candy
4/6/16, 13:57 - Cindy L: i meant to say i was shrunk down to the size of the candies and climbing around the shelves of candy
4/6/16, 13:57 - Mom: no. 1 is horrible but no. 2 seems to be ur favour as a child
4/6/16, 13:58 - Cindy L: there was also someone else with me
4/6/16, 13:58 - Mom: who?
4/6/16, 13:58 - Cindy L: don't remember
4/6/16, 13:58 - Cindy L: probably didn't know that person
4/6/16, 13:58 - Mom: like alice in the wonderland?
4/6/16, 13:58 - Cindy L: anyways
4/6/16, 13:58 - Cindy L: we were climbing up
4/6/16, 13:59 - Cindy L: and then the shelves were kind of disappearing by sliding into the walls
4/6/16, 13:59 - Cindy L: and then slowly his body began to decay
4/6/16, 13:59 - Cindy L: like the skin and flesh were melting off his skeleton
4/6/16, 13:59 - Mom: whose body?
4/6/16, 14:00 - Cindy L: the guy who was climbing next to me
4/6/16, 14:00 - Mom: horrible
4/6/16, 14:00 - Mom: do u know him?
4/6/16, 14:00 - Cindy L: cuz we ate a lot of the shit i guess
4/6/16, 14:00 - Cindy L: no
4/6/16, 14:00 - Cindy L: didn't recognize him, can't recall his face
4/6/16, 14:00 - Cindy L: and then the shelves disappeared and i fell
4/6/16, 14:01 - Cindy L: into the void
4/6/16, 14:01 - Mom: is ur body melted as his?
4/6/16, 14:01 - Cindy L: we don't know yet at this point
4/6/16, 14:01 - Cindy L: so i fell until i hit something cushiony
4/6/16, 14:01 - Cindy L: like a marshmallow
4/6/16, 14:02 - Cindy L: and i noticed he turned into a robot.
4/6/16, 14:02 - Cindy L: or a cyborg cuz he had robotic parts
4/6/16, 14:02 - Cindy L: there were mirrors on the wall so i went over to look at my reflection
4/6/16, 14:03 - Cindy L: instead of seeing a face, i saw a metal dish stamped with a smiley face
4/6/16, 14:04 - Cindy L: so i guess i turned into a cyborg too
4/6/16, 14:05 - Cindy L: and then behind us a pair of twins emerged from the dark
4/6/16, 14:06 - Cindy L: they look very weird, had a sort of fat-skittle shaped body
4/6/16, 14:06 - Cindy L: like two stout jars
4/6/16, 14:07 - Cindy L: and their faces were like painted onto the top part of the skittle
4/6/16, 14:08 - Cindy L: they walked funny and sort of made a sound which sounded liked a baby's rattle as they moved towards us.
4/6/16, 14:09 - Cindy L: anyways
4/6/16, 14:09 - Cindy L: they appeared nice so we followed them
4/6/16, 14:10 - Cindy L: dunno why but i started to imitate their strange movements so they wouldn't think we were suspicious.
4/6/16, 14:10 - Cindy L: as in walking motions
4/6/16, 14:10 - Cindy L: they took us to a kitchen to cut onions.
4/6/16, 14:11 - Cindy L: to chop onions
4/6/16, 14:11 - Cindy L: one of them pulled out a knife and threatened us to chop onions.
4/6/16, 14:11 - Cindy L: they didn't look so nice anymore.
4/6/16, 14:12 - Cindy L: scary infact
4/6/16, 14:12 - Cindy L: so i woke myself up
4/6/16, 14:14 - Cindy L: i was kinda worried that I wouldn't be able to do so and they would find out i tried to escape.
4/6/16, 14:14 - Cindy L: but thank god i managed to do so
4/6/16, 14:15 - Cindy L: when i woke up i felt bad for the other guy cuz i don't know what will happen to him.
4/6/16, 14:15 - Cindy L: so i poked around on the ipad to forget about it
4/6/16, 14:16 - Cindy L: its very alice in wonderland.
4/6/16, 14:16 - Cindy L: but creepy like the grim brother's version or something

4/6/16, 20:32 - Cindy L: And then I sat on my bed for  while
4/6/16, 20:33 - Cindy L: And then I'm not sure if I sent into a seizure or started hallucinating
4/6/16, 20:33 - Cindy L: But very weird stuff happened

4/7/16, 15:19 - Cindy L: But I sort of fell asleep

4/7/16, 15:21 - Mom: but what chinese is that? canton or mando?
4/7/16, 15:21 - Mom: isn't the mainlander speak mando?
4/7/16, 15:51 - Cindy L: Mandarin
4/7/16, 15:51 - Cindy L: There wasn't anyone in the flat that day that spoke mando
4/7/16, 15:52 - Cindy L: And I also 'someone' comes into my room and take picturea
4/7/16, 15:52 - Cindy L: Saw
4/7/16, 15:53 - Mom: what? who went into ur room?

4/7/16, 15:55 - Mom: if u think those r hallucination, why u heard mando?
4/7/16, 15:56 - Cindy L: Er u can heard hallucinations too u know
4/7/16, 15:56 - Mom: yea, but the point is why mando?
4/7/16, 15:56 - Cindy L: My point is that my brain distorted the Russian and made it sound like Mandarin and english
4/7/16, 15:56 - Mom: do u think they chinese guy is a real man or hallucination?
4/7/16, 15:57 - Cindy L: The Chinese man is definitely not real cuz there were no Chinese old men around in the flat at that time
4/7/16, 15:57 - Cindy L: And then u r going to ask me how do i know
4/7/16, 15:58 - Cindy L: The flat is so small and I'm always here so I know who is in and who is not.
4/7/16, 15:58 - Mom: no, i was wondering why not canto instead of mando?
4/7/16, 15:59 - Mom: u saw that old chinese guy's face? did u rmb his clothes? colour?

4/8/16, 16:06 - Cindy L: It works quite well
4/8/16, 16:06 - Mom: not afraid of hallucination if eating ben & jerry again?
4/8/16, 16:06 - Cindy L: It's OK it's the middle of the day
4/8/16, 16:06 - Mom: hahaha
4/8/16, 16:06 - Cindy L: And last time I had a bowl of ice cream
4/8/16, 16:07 - Cindy L: I just use it as a condiment right now

4/8/16, 16:08 - Mom: okok
4/8/16, 16:08 - Mom: black coffee no good
4/8/16, 16:36 - Cindy L: Gosh reading UK news is tragic
4/8/16, 16:36 - Mom: ?
4/8/16, 16:37 - Cindy L: It's like one tragedy after another
4/8/16, 16:38 - Mom: i mean what news ur reading?
4/8/16, 16:38 - Cindy L: I follow sky on fb cuz hey hv videos
4/8/16, 16:39 - Cindy L: There was the case abt the two girls 13 and 14 who murdered this old woman
4/8/16, 16:39 - Cindy L: And then a lot of sex trafficking.
4/8/16, 16:39 - Cindy L: and then mental illness
4/8/16, 16:40 - Mom: these r typical news here in hk
4/8/16, 16:40 - Mom: and there're more abt committing suicides here
4/8/16, 16:40 - Cindy L: Er a 13 and 14 year old murdering an old lady?
4/8/16, 16:40 - Cindy L: Not really.
4/8/16, 16:40 - Cindy L: If u commit suicide that's ur choice.
4/8/16, 16:41 - Mom: here we've an old father sexually harassed a 5 yrs old girl
4/8/16, 16:41 - Cindy L: People who trafficked is a tragedy
4/8/16, 16:41 - Cindy L: Yah pedophiles
4/8/16, 16:41 - Cindy L: That's what I meant by mental illnesa
4/8/16, 16:42 - Cindy L: What's interesting are the comments.
4/8/16, 16:43 - Mom: here in hk there're lots of ridiculous events these days, and ppl just can't do anything to prevent them
4/8/16, 16:43 - Mom: helpless
4/8/16, 16:43 - Cindy L: Yah tragedy
4/8/16, 16:44 - Cindy L: Like pedophilia
4/8/16, 16:44 - Cindy L: Tragic for child
4/8/16, 16:44 - Mom: social values r changing alot
4/8/16, 16:45 - Cindy L: Tragic for the perpetrator too cuz what makes them sexually attracted to kids is an intrinsic hormonal imbalance in the brain
4/8/16, 16:45 - Cindy L: Which the gov and society refuses to recognize as a mental illness
4/8/16, 16:45 - Mom: u mean uk govt?
4/8/16, 16:45 - Cindy L: I mean in general
4/8/16, 16:46 - Cindy L: I mean paedophile is a crime
4/8/16, 16:47 - Mom: this chinese govt in hk is just thinking of the economic value of ppl and the society, they care nothing abt others, not to mention mental health
4/8/16, 16:47 - Cindy L: Er sure.
4/8/16, 16:47 - Mom: so more and more ppl here become mentally sick
4/8/16, 16:48 - Mom: but who cares, only if they can still make money here
4/8/16, 16:48 - Mom: if not, then commit suicide la
4/8/16, 16:48 - Mom: this is hk now
4/8/16, 16:48 - Cindy L: Er but thats not the govs fault is it.
4/8/16, 16:49 - Mom: why not?
4/8/16, 16:49 - Cindy L: I mean it's not gov's job to look after u mentally as well
4/8/16, 16:50 - Mom: a totaly failure in public policy which only emphases on nothing except economic aspect of a society
4/8/16, 16:51 - Cindy L: Depends what u think government is for really.
4/8/16, 16:51 - Mom: ur right, it's not govt job to look after u mental health, but it's govt who push u to become a mentally-ill person
4/8/16, 16:51 - Cindy L: Not exactly
4/8/16, 16:51 - Cindy L: I would say it's more societal pressures
4/8/16, 16:52 - Cindy L: People created these things themselves
4/8/16, 16:52 - Mom: unless u agree to a corrupt govt, otherwise i can't believe that's not the govt's duty to implement fair public policy for its ppl there
4/8/16, 16:53 - Cindy L: I don't agree to a corrupt gov but to be realistic it's not like a fair one exists in the world
4/8/16, 16:53 - Cindy L: U know the UK is in fact a dictatorship
4/8/16, 16:54 - Mom: so u think ppl in "cultural revolution" like to become so crazy???
4/8/16, 16:54 - Cindy L: Don't get it? What by crazy?
4/8/16, 16:54 - Mom: can u speak freely in the internet in uk???
4/8/16, 16:54 - Cindy L: What do u mean?
4/8/16, 16:55 - Cindy L: Yea I guess, but then if u say something outrageous people gang up on u as well
4/8/16, 16:55 - Cindy L: So not really
4/8/16, 16:57 - Cindy L: My point is that I realise in the shower yesterday that there is no point in getting emotionall abt politics.
4/8/16, 16:57 - Mom: do u know 2 persons in Guangzhou today were sentenced to 1 1/2 and 4 1/2 yrs imprisonment only bc they post their support to hk's "occupy central" movement??
4/8/16, 16:57 - Mom: isn't it ridiculous???
4/8/16, 16:57 - Mom: this isn't emotional, it's deadly helpless
4/8/16, 16:58 - Cindy L: Er so what u r saying is the gov is taking away ur rights to life freely
4/8/16, 16:58 - Cindy L: Right
4/8/16, 16:58 - Mom: turning to china-ish here in hk
4/8/16, 16:59 - Mom: but still this case won't be happening in uk
4/8/16, 16:59 - Cindy L: I guess so, ppl in HK just unhappy to hv Chinese gov
4/8/16, 17:00 - Cindy L: But it's not like we actually hv a legitimate gov right.
4/8/16, 17:01 - Cindy L: But HK ppl r too chicken to gain independence
4/8/16, 17:01 - Mom: who dares to say "independence"?
4/8/16, 17:02 - Cindy L: But the thing is.
4/8/16, 17:02 - Mom: those elites r trying their best to please china govt in order to get the max benefits
4/8/16, 17:02 - Cindy L: If u don't want independence and u don't want Chinese gov, what do u want.
4/8/16, 17:03 - Mom: and the poor ppl just have no resources to do????
4/8/16, 17:03 - Cindy L: To do what?
4/8/16, 17:03 - Mom: like emigrate to other country
4/8/16, 17:04 - Cindy L: But it's not like they are starving or living in poverty
4/8/16, 17:05 - Mom: ei, more and more ppl r under financial pressure these days cuz the living costs r skyrocketing like transportation, meals, groceries....
4/8/16, 17:05 - Cindy L: That's an economic problem then isn't it
4/8/16, 17:05 - Mom: still cheaper than that in uk
4/8/16, 17:06 - Cindy L: And the whole world is having recession so it's not that surprising
4/8/16, 17:07 - Mom: u can say it's economic probs but don't u know supply of most things here r controlled by china govt?
4/8/16, 17:07 - Cindy L: Well... True
4/8/16, 17:07 - Mom: china govt is just robbing hk's treasury
4/8/16, 17:08 - Mom: so that becomes political issue
4/8/16, 17:08 - Cindy L: Hmmmmmmm that's more of a patronage problem
4/8/16, 17:08 - Cindy L: Yes it's a political issue
4/8/16, 17:09 - Cindy L: But it's kind of like paying protection fee isn't it
4/8/16, 17:09 - Cindy L: Or else they will screw is over
4/8/16, 17:09 - Mom: now, will u still say those r only econ probs?
4/8/16, 17:09 - Cindy L: Screw us over
4/8/16, 17:09 - Cindy L: But it's not like we hv a right to not be screwed over
4/8/16, 17:10 - Cindy L: Imagine u run a shop on someones turf
4/8/16, 17:11 - Cindy L: They protect ur property and let u do safe business there if u pay
4/8/16, 17:12 - Cindy L: Otherwise, anybody can come and screw u over.
4/8/16, 17:12 - Mom: i don't agree china is protecting hk
4/8/16, 17:12 - Cindy L: I dunno/ I sort of think our perception of freedom seems to be messed up?
4/8/16, 17:13 - Mom: instead i wud say it is exploiting us
4/8/16, 17:13 - Cindy L: If u think abt it, the fact that u can enjoy all those freedoms is because there r institutions protecting ur rights
4/8/16, 17:14 - Mom: they just want to squeeze every money from hk and then kick us away within a short period of time
4/8/16, 17:14 - Cindy L: Outside the state, u would hv to spend ur time worrying abt survival and keeping ur property safe.
4/8/16, 17:16 - Cindy L: Hmmm
4/8/16, 17:17 - Mom: It's not protection, it's kind of treating hk as ÊêñÈå¢Ê®π
4/8/16, 17:17 - Cindy L: But money is not fixed.
4/8/16, 17:17 - Cindy L: HK is essentially quite a prosperous place.
4/8/16, 17:18 - Mom: i don't rlly mean money alone, it can be any kind of resources like HR resources...
4/8/16, 17:18 - Cindy L: Hmmmm
4/8/16, 17:18 - Cindy L: OK say
4/8/16, 17:20 - Cindy L: But it seems to make sense to direct resources from rich places to help develop poor areas??
4/8/16, 17:20 - Mom: hahaha
4/8/16, 17:20 - Cindy L: The problem here is that they r corrupt?
4/8/16, 17:20 - Mom: agree if u live in a just and fair society
4/8/16, 17:21 - Mom: but u rlly think hk is like that now?
4/8/16, 17:21 - Cindy L: So the problem is corruption.
4/8/16, 17:21 - Cindy L: I dunno, I'm just trying to think abt why people r angry and r they justified in doing so.
4/8/16, 17:22 - Mom: the prob is those "high-level" elites just want to protect their own wealth and future prospect
4/8/16, 17:22 - Cindy L: A lot of people I know don't support the occupy central thing now even if they had before
4/8/16, 17:22 - Cindy L: But obviously that is happening everywhere in the world
4/8/16, 17:23 - Cindy L: I'm not even gonna mention Africa but look at Panama papers
4/8/16, 17:23 - Mom: bc the economy is downturn now, and ppl's money is affected
4/8/16, 17:23 - Mom: so more and more ppl do blame the occupy central
4/8/16, 17:24 - Cindy L: It's not like the occupy central thing made a lot of sense either
4/8/16, 17:24 - Cindy L: Agree with people unhappy abt recession
4/8/16, 17:24 - Mom: in fact the occupy central did nothing abt the economy
4/8/16, 17:24 - Cindy L: But booms and busts r a fact of life
4/8/16, 17:25 - Mom: ppl just put that as a scapegoat abt the economic downturn
4/8/16, 17:25 - Cindy L: Yea agree occupy central did not really impact economy
4/8/16, 17:25 - Cindy L: But I think it did heighten social unrest
4/8/16, 17:27 - Mom: this is the china govt or the existing hk govt's excuse of not running hk properly, they blame on occupy central, umbrella movement and all the political turmoil these days, so that to evade their responsibilities
4/8/16, 17:28 - Cindy L: Yea because they did this, it created an opportunity to use them as scapegoat and increase police force
4/8/16, 17:28 - Cindy L: Was it worth it?
4/8/16, 17:29 - Mom: who bother the costs?
4/8/16, 17:29 - Mom: anyway, it's society's costs not the govt
4/8/16, 17:29 - Cindy L: Not really considering what they asked for was almost impossible and even if they managed to achieve universal suffrage all that would achieve is increase legitimacy of Chinese gov.
4/8/16, 17:30 - Mom: and those high-level ppl just want big money in short time like the corruption happened in china
4/8/16, 17:30 - Cindy L: I mean it was definitely not worth it for the university students
4/8/16, 17:30 - Cindy L: And the adults who were leading this mvmt knew this.
4/8/16, 17:32 - Cindy L: Corruption is also a fact of life because greed is human nature.
4/8/16, 17:33 - Cindy L: So obviously the problem is poor institutions to enforce anti corruption mechanisms
4/8/16, 17:33 - Cindy L: Which as an individual there is really nothing u can do abt
4/8/16, 17:33 - Cindy L: So a tragedy
4/8/16, 17:34 - Mom: universal suffrage is a best reason to put up bc this wud create the china govt more probs in the future elections, besides china govt dare not agree to this proposal, u see tibet....
4/8/16, 17:34 - Cindy L: Lol if I was Chinese gov I would actually allow elections to be held
4/8/16, 17:35 - Cindy L: I mean it would only run in their favor
4/8/16, 17:35 - Mom: icac now becomes the personal body guard for the leung-govt
4/8/16, 17:35 - Cindy L: It is very easy to manipulate an election.
4/8/16, 17:36 - Cindy L: Plus it increases the legitimacy of ur gov, it can actually call itself a democracy
4/8/16, 17:36 - Mom: yea if china govt allow universal suffrage, their probability of winning most places might still be there, but they wud want to do so cuz there's risk
4/8/16, 17:36 - Cindy L: African countries r the most corrupt in the world
4/8/16, 17:36 - Cindy L: And they run elections
4/8/16, 17:36 - Cindy L: Lol
4/8/16, 17:37 - Cindy L: Anyways there r more shitty govs in the world than fair govs
4/8/16, 17:38 - Cindy L: There's really no point getting depressed abt being oppressed
4/8/16, 17:38 - Mom: yea, govt can always win only by corruption, but china govt just don't want the risk cuz there're still alot more economic problems within china, they can't afford the risk here in hk, like taiwan
4/8/16, 17:38 - Cindy L: I'm not saying one should be happy abt living in such a situation
4/8/16, 17:40 - Cindy L: But to complain abt it everyday and make u depressed is also quite a dumb thing to do....
4/8/16, 17:41 - Mom: that's what ur dad is doing everyday.... not me
4/8/16, 17:41 - Cindy L: Might as well think abt useful things like things u can actually control.
4/8/16, 17:41 - Cindy L: Yea
4/8/16, 17:41 - Cindy L: Not healthy
4/8/16, 17:41 - Mom: i wud rather think if there's way out
4/8/16, 17:43 - Cindy L: Think abt all the ppl in a worst place then u.
4/8/16, 17:44 - Mom: but think abt the university students here, they actually have to face this scenario -- more competition and less opportunities, not to mention unfair treatment by the leung-govt's policy here
4/8/16, 17:44 - Cindy L: Yes but even if u study overseas u are at disadvantage
4/8/16, 17:45 - Mom: so want to come back????
4/8/16, 17:45 - Cindy L: Because companies are less likely to hire someone who needs a visa
4/8/16, 17:45 - Cindy L: No, just musings.
4/8/16, 17:45 - Mom: this also applies here in hk
4/8/16, 17:45 - Cindy L: Yo I spend a lot of time thinking.
4/8/16, 17:46 - Cindy L: Cuz its so boring.
4/8/16, 17:46 - Mom: boring? what?
4/8/16, 17:46 - Mom: live is boring there in uk?
4/8/16, 17:46 - Cindy L: There's nothing much to do
4/8/16, 17:46 - Mom: don't get it?
4/8/16, 17:47 - Cindy L: I mean life is pretty boring in general
4/8/16, 17:47 - Cindy L: Ppl here just drink, smoke laugh and sing
4/8/16, 17:47 - Mom: nothing new or funny to do at ur leisure time or the prospect is restricted after grad?
4/8/16, 17:47 - Cindy L: I guess in leisure time.
4/8/16, 17:48 - Cindy L: I'm bored.
4/8/16, 17:48 - Mom: ppl in hk eat, gamble, play video games...
4/8/16, 17:48 - Cindy L: That's what I've been trying to aay
4/8/16, 17:48 - Cindy L: Say
4/8/16, 17:48 - Mom: ic, univ life is boring at lse
4/8/16, 17:48 - Cindy L: Video games r fun, u use ur brain
4/8/16, 17:49 - Cindy L: If I didn't hv to cook, I would be more bored
4/8/16, 17:49 - Mom: ic
4/8/16, 17:49 - Mom: actually, london ppl r so bored
4/8/16, 17:50 - Cindy L: Cuz life is pretty boring.
4/8/16, 17:50 - Cindy L: HK is pretty boring too
4/8/16, 17:50 - Mom: the reason is u have been accustomed to a dynamic life in hk
4/8/16, 17:51 - Mom: if u were me, u want to die
4/8/16, 17:51 - Cindy L: Ppl living on farms must die of loneliness
4/8/16, 17:51 - Cindy L: Yea if I spend my life as a homemaker I think I will die of boredom
4/8/16, 17:51 - Mom: what kind of excitement u want?
4/8/16, 17:52 - Mom: so it's good u've so many exciting dreams to fill up ur boring life!!!!!
4/8/16, 17:52 - Cindy L: Lol

4/8/16, 17:53 - Cindy L: No wonder ppl do so much stuff in uni
4/8/16, 17:55 - Cindy L: Time to revise econ
4/8/16, 18:00 - Cindy L: Should I go to the Bible study group

4/9/16, 14:23 - Mom: but u said u had a good dream, so u slept until 1030 right?
4/9/16, 14:24 - Cindy L: Yea I count those as naps
4/9/16, 14:24 - Mom: did u eat  Âá∫Ââç‰∏Ä‰∏Å...?
4/9/16, 14:27 - Mom: what happened last night?
4/9/16, 14:32 - Cindy L: No I don't hv any food in the kitchen left
4/9/16, 16:11 - Cindy L: Yo
4/9/16, 16:11 - Cindy L: Bt
4/9/16, 16:12 - Cindy L: Did u see in the video that at some point I looked behind me a few times?
4/9/16, 16:22 - Mom: yea
4/9/16, 16:23 - Mom: what happened at that time>
4/9/16, 16:28 - Mom: is there any stimulus that cause ur seizure last night?
4/9/16, 16:37 - Cindy L: That's when I thought I saw a child behind me
4/9/16, 16:38 - Cindy L: I saw her in the video on the screen
4/9/16, 16:38 - Mom: u were watching a video at that time?
4/9/16, 16:38 - Cindy L: I use the computer webcam to record
4/9/16, 16:39 - Cindy L: I could barely open the camera app
4/9/16, 16:39 - Mom: u saw her in ur recording video?
4/9/16, 16:39 - Cindy L: Yh
4/9/16, 16:39 - Cindy L: That's why I turned around
4/9/16, 16:40 - Mom: have u watched ur recorded video again today?
4/9/16, 16:40 - Cindy L: No not yet
4/9/16, 16:40 - Cindy L: But that's a hallucination
4/9/16, 16:40 - Cindy L: My brain goes funny and sees weird stuff during these seizure like episodes
4/9/16, 16:40 - Mom: ic, when u saw this girl, u tried to open the camera app to record this video right?
4/9/16, 16:41 - Cindy L: No
4/9/16, 16:41 - Cindy L: I finished dinner
4/9/16, 16:41 - Cindy L: And then suddenly started to shakr
4/9/16, 16:41 - Cindy L: I had been shaking for abt 5 mins or even more before I thought I should record this
4/9/16, 16:42 - Mom: like the scenario after dinner at samyeung b4?
4/9/16, 16:42 - Cindy L: Yes, no?
4/9/16, 16:42 - Cindy L: Not exactly
4/9/16, 16:42 - Cindy L: After samyeung I couldn't walk
4/9/16, 16:43 - Cindy L: Here is like I went into a trance
4/9/16, 16:43 - Mom: but in the video, u were just swaying around and i can only see ur seizure of the jaw
4/9/16, 16:43 - Cindy L: I see.
4/9/16, 16:44 - Cindy L: Swaying around is the weakness
4/9/16, 16:44 - Cindy L: Cuz my muscles hv gone weak, I can only move by putting a lot of effort into swinging my body bits around
4/9/16, 16:44 - Mom: so u had ur dinner very late until mid-night?
4/9/16, 16:44 - Cindy L: And then u saw the jaw tremble right
4/9/16, 16:45 - Cindy L: There were also tremors in the rest of the body
4/9/16, 16:45 - Cindy L: I had dinner round 2100
4/9/16, 16:45 - Mom: have u seen this child b4 in ur hallucination?
4/9/16, 16:46 - Cindy L: But I only had two chicken tenders and curry with rice.
4/9/16, 16:46 - Cindy L: Child?
4/9/16, 16:46 - Cindy L: Hmmm
4/9/16, 16:46 - Mom: how long after dinner u had ur shaking?
4/9/16, 16:46 - Cindy L: Maybe like half an hr?
4/9/16, 16:46 - Cindy L: I was working on econ notes.
4/9/16, 16:46 - Cindy L: And I don't remember seeing the specific child
4/9/16, 16:47 - Cindy L: But whenever I see hallucinations, they r always children
4/9/16, 16:47 - Cindy L: Girls
4/9/16, 16:48 - Mom: did u hear something?
4/9/16, 16:48 - Cindy L: No
4/9/16, 16:48 - Cindy L: Probably cuz imagine dragons was playing
4/9/16, 16:48 - Cindy L: If it was quiet maybe
4/9/16, 16:49 - Mom: cuz u've produced several bits of sound, i thought u were trying to say something
4/9/16, 16:50 - Mom: yea, i heard some background sound there, probably coming from ur computer
4/9/16, 16:50 - Cindy L: No i was probably just groaning cuz its uncomfortable
4/9/16, 16:51 - Cindy L: But I don't particularly remember making those sounds either
4/9/16, 16:51 - Mom: don't eat curry
4/9/16, 16:51 - Cindy L: I dun think it's curry
4/9/16, 16:52 - Cindy L: Cuz I had it the day before as well
4/9/16, 16:52 - Mom: i have been reading some passages abt the vagne nerve symptoms, that said ur vagne nerve might be inflamed
4/9/16, 16:53 - Cindy L: Yea
4/9/16, 16:53 - Mom: rmb that u had asked me abt the vagne nerve?
4/9/16, 16:53 - Cindy L: I know
4/9/16, 16:54 - Cindy L: Probably immune problem I suspect
4/9/16, 16:54 - Mom: that's pretty much similar to ur situation which ur symptoms come out after eating
4/9/16, 16:54 - Cindy L: Yea doesn't particular seem to be a specific type of food either
4/9/16, 16:55 - Cindy L: I change my diet and nothing happens, but after a while the symptoms will surface for the same food
4/9/16, 16:56 - Mom: u did have change ur diet, but not on single variable very time, so it's difficult to say u have isolated the cause
4/9/16, 16:56 - Mom: so, better try single type of food every time
4/9/16, 16:57 - Cindy L: But there are days where I eat exactly the same foods and two days
4/9/16, 16:57 - Cindy L: And then I would hv seizure on one day and not the other
4/9/16, 16:57 - Mom: usually the second day have seizure right?
4/9/16, 16:58 - Cindy L: Yea
4/9/16, 16:58 - Cindy L: I see probably reach threshold
4/9/16, 16:58 - Mom: allergy appears on the second dose but not the first
4/9/16, 16:58 - Cindy L: Right
4/9/16, 16:59 - Cindy L: I see
4/9/16, 16:59 - Mom: so, if symptom comes out the second day with the exact menu, there must be something wrong in this menu
4/9/16, 16:59 - Mom: and reaction appears on the second dose
4/9/16, 17:00 - Cindy L: Damn
4/9/16, 17:00 - Mom: allergic reaction also plays like this
4/9/16, 17:01 - Cindy L: Autoimmune then
4/9/16, 17:02 - Cindy L: Makes sense that my neurons probably went through some mutation due to chronic inflammation.
4/9/16, 17:02 - Mom: don't know, cuz vagne nerve connects ur whole body to the brain, it can mimic various symptoms
4/9/16, 17:03 - Cindy L: Grrat
4/9/16, 17:04 - Mom: rmb that u had ur spine hurt after doing sit up exercise at tsing yi, can u recall when that incident happened?
4/9/16, 17:04 - Cindy L: That was after moving.
4/9/16, 17:05 - Cindy L: Over summer yr 12
4/9/16, 17:05 - Mom: jul/aug?
4/9/16, 17:06 - Mom: https://www.atlantotec.com/en/disorders/vagus-nerve-disorders
4/9/16, 17:07 - Mom: watch this link, i srsly doubt if there's mis-alighment of ur atlas
4/9/16, 17:07 - Mom: https://www.atlantotec.com/en/fundamentals/atlas-therapy-importance
4/9/16, 17:10 - Cindy L: But I had no siificanct injury on brain or spine
4/9/16, 17:11 - Cindy L: Do i hv a high level of testosterone?
4/9/16, 17:11 - Cindy L: My puberty was super delayed.
4/9/16, 17:12 - Mom: u have never test testosterone, but why high level?
4/9/16, 17:12 - Cindy L: Cuz estrogen makes u develop into adult faster
4/9/16, 17:12 - Mom: if high level testosterone, u shud have developed some sorts of man characteristics, but u don't
4/9/16, 17:12 - Cindy L: So testosterone pushes it back later.
4/9/16, 17:13 - Cindy L: Not necesary
4/9/16, 17:13 - Mom: u told me u had done sit-up which might be a cause to have the altas mis-aligned
4/9/16, 17:14 - Cindy L: No then it would hurt like hell
4/9/16, 17:14 - Mom: u did told me that u had serious back pain after doing that sit up exercise
4/9/16, 17:14 - Cindy L: My head would be dislocated
4/9/16, 17:15 - Mom: not a must dislocated, might be just very slightly mis-alignment
4/9/16, 17:15 - Cindy L: It was lower spine as well
4/9/16, 17:15 - Cindy L: The pain was in the leg
4/9/16, 17:15 - Mom: sigh....
4/9/16, 17:17 - Mom: yea, at that time, we put the blame on ur sclerosis, but who knows what the exact cause is?
4/9/16, 17:24 - Mom: one more thing, during ur shaking episode in the video, ur eyes were closed throughout almost the whole period, i was wondering if that mysterious "child" appeared only on ur mind and u had never seen her
4/9/16, 17:24 - Mom: on the screen
4/9/16, 17:30 - Cindy L: Yea probably I suspect that
4/9/16, 17:31 - Cindy L: But its not really dreaming since I'm not asleep
4/9/16, 17:31 - Mom: but ur eyes were closed most of the time, never open except at the end of the episode?
4/9/16, 17:34 - Mom: it's somewhat like at tsing yi, u had an episode that u said something stuck at ur mouth and u put ur hands inside to take that thing out, ur eyes were also closed all the time, but u didn't look sleeping???
4/9/16, 17:36 - Mom: as for last night's episode, i think it's probably caused by ur vagne nerve's reaction after meal
4/9/16, 18:00 - Cindy L: Yea I mean u can't really call it dreaming when im stils fully conscious and is can tell my surroundings and where everything is even though I hv my eyes closed
4/9/16, 18:00 - Cindy L: Vagus nerve ka?
4/9/16, 18:00 - Cindy L: I just went out to hv a sandwich
4/9/16, 18:01 - Cindy L: Came back Sat down
4/9/16, 18:01 - Cindy L: Fell a more pronounced heart rate
4/9/16, 18:01 - Cindy L: And then it suddenly got faster
4/9/16, 18:01 - Cindy L: And then the same thing happened
4/9/16, 18:02 - Cindy L: It feels like the arrythmic i used to get after tennis.
4/9/16, 18:02 - Cindy L: I just woke up
4/9/16, 18:03 - Mom: that's why i said ur symptoms resemble that caused by vagus nerve prob
4/9/16, 18:04 - Mom: see everytime, u had various sorts of symptoms after eating
4/9/16, 18:07 - Cindy L: From now on eating is danger
4/9/16, 18:07 - Cindy L: I seem to be OK with fats
4/9/16, 18:08 - Mom: no, just eat simple thing
4/9/16, 18:08 - Mom: simple combination
4/9/16, 18:08 - Cindy L: I hv been eating simple things
4/9/16, 18:08 - Cindy L: All I had just now was a sandwich
4/9/16, 18:10 - Mom: but everytime, u had different kinds of prob coming out after eating, don't u think it's not the prob with the vagus nerve?
4/9/16, 18:11 - Cindy L: Yah there's not enough research abt the vagus unfortunately
4/9/16, 18:11 - Cindy L: They know even less abt the  neural system in the gut
4/9/16, 18:11 - Cindy L: Than abt the brain stem
4/9/16, 18:12 - Cindy L: Anyways I'm get really tired after an episode
4/9/16, 18:12 - Mom: go take a rest
4/9/16, 18:12 - Cindy L: Kk
4/9/16, 18:13 - Cindy L: Maybe soon I can't tell difference between dream and reality and I will start sleeping more
4/9/16, 18:14 - Mom: sigh...
4/9/16, 18:14 - Mom: ur depressed again
4/9/16, 18:14 - Cindy L: No not really
4/9/16, 18:14 - Cindy L: I cured myself of depression
4/9/16, 18:15 - Cindy L: I'm just making a prediction
4/9/16, 18:15 - Cindy L: Though
4/9/16, 18:15 - Cindy L: On the bright side, I don't think the dreams hv changed in intensity or vividness
4/9/16, 18:16 - Cindy L: It's quite close to real vr
4/9/16, 18:17 - Cindy L: I mean I've tried the Samsung gear vr headset and I can say I can produce a better vr when I dream
4/9/16, 18:18 - Mom: is there a day u had no dream during ur sleep time?
4/9/16, 18:19 - Cindy L: Er probably not
4/9/16, 18:19 - Cindy L: I don't think it's possible to sleep without dreaming.
4/9/16, 18:19 - Cindy L: For any normal person
4/9/16, 18:20 - Cindy L: U might hv had really good sleep and u barely remember it, but u will still dream
4/9/16, 18:21 - Mom: i mean u don't have memorable dreams during ur sleeptime?
4/9/16, 18:21 - Cindy L: Oh yea definitely
4/9/16, 18:21 - Cindy L: They're not super vivid and memorable all the time.
4/9/16, 18:22 - Mom: ok
4/9/16, 18:22 - Cindy L: Most days its just boring stuff
4/9/16, 18:22 - Cindy L: There was that time I slept in the library and I didn't even know I drifted off.
4/9/16, 18:23 - Mom: kk
4/9/16, 18:23 - Cindy L: There r some days I become really anxious at right.
4/9/16, 18:23 - Cindy L: Not sure why
4/9/16, 18:24 - Cindy L: But I get really scared
4/9/16, 18:24 - Cindy L: Of everything and anything that can happen
4/9/16, 18:24 - Cindy L: Mostly of the unknown and the dark
4/9/16, 18:25 - Cindy L: I more of an irrational fear
4/9/16, 18:25 - Cindy L: U know how when people worry they think too much and stuff
4/9/16, 18:26 - Cindy L: Well imagine u think ten times as much and sorry becomes anxiety and real amygdala fear
4/9/16, 18:27 - Cindy L: But then if I play music, it helps calm my brain down.
4/9/16, 18:27 - Mom: i understand it
4/9/16, 18:28 - Cindy L: So not sure if I've become actually more emotional due to changes in the amygdala
4/9/16, 18:28 - Cindy L: Or due to natural maturing process
4/9/16, 18:28 - Mom: that's why i always tell u to sleep earlier to avoid this scenario
4/9/16, 18:28 - Cindy L: That's not really the problem.
4/9/16, 18:28 - Cindy L: It's that it's dark.
4/9/16, 18:28 - Cindy L: I'm not gonna sleep at 6pm
4/9/16, 18:29 - Mom: no, i don't think u have ur amygdala changed, it's just normal for everyone alone in a place and what's more is that ur sick
4/9/16, 18:29 - Cindy L: I associate scary things with night time.
4/9/16, 18:29 - Cindy L: It's not like there's nobody here
4/9/16, 18:29 - Cindy L: They already came back from holiday
4/9/16, 18:30 - Mom: when i was in london, alone in hotel, i wud feel a bit scared
4/9/16, 18:30 - Cindy L: fair enough
4/9/16, 18:31 - Mom: ur flatmates don't stay in the same room with u
4/9/16, 18:31 - Cindy L: I get scared to the extent that I have had panic attacks.
4/9/16, 18:31 - Cindy L: U only get those if u hv a lot of stress
4/9/16, 18:31 - Mom: u need someone to stay by ur side at night-time
4/9/16, 18:31 - Cindy L: But that was a few weeks ago
4/9/16, 18:32 - Cindy L: Like feb
4/9/16, 18:32 - Mom: bc ur sort of helpless, so that's normal u become so anxious
4/9/16, 18:32 - Cindy L: Now less of that shit
4/9/16, 18:32 - Mom: i can tell u that ur response is normal as a child without a mom beside her
4/9/16, 18:33 - Cindy L: Now if u think abt the cataplexy
4/9/16, 18:33 - Cindy L: Wouldn't it make sense if I was more apathetic instead of emotional?
4/9/16, 18:33 - Mom: rmb that u actually had never been alone for sooooo long period during ur lifetime, right?
4/9/16, 18:33 - Cindy L: Yeah but I got used to it.
4/9/16, 18:34 - Mom: it rlly takes time for every normal person to get used to being alone in a situation
4/9/16, 18:34 - Mom: this is not easy
4/9/16, 18:35 - Mom: i can say even ur dad can't stay alone for long time easily
4/9/16, 18:35 - Cindy L: Fine fair enough
4/9/16, 18:35 - Mom: what apathetic?
4/9/16, 18:35 - Cindy L: Like controlled emotions
4/9/16, 18:36 - Mom: so that's not ur amygdala prob, it's a natural reaction for every person even adult
4/9/16, 18:37 - Cindy L: No I mean in order to fall less I should hv learnt to regulate my emotions.
4/9/16, 18:37 - Mom: don't get what u mean ur more apathetic than emotional?
4/9/16, 18:37 - Mom: how to regulate?
4/9/16, 18:37 - Cindy L: Like detachment
4/9/16, 18:38 - Mom: u think u can do that?
4/9/16, 18:38 - Cindy L: Don't feel like I've really done that
4/9/16, 18:38 - Cindy L: Anyways that just means u avoid social situations
4/9/16, 18:39 - Mom: no, not really have to
4/9/16, 18:39 - Cindy L: It's very difficult to be apathetic and social...üòë
4/9/16, 18:39 - Mom: but it's quite difficult to u as ur such a happy person
4/9/16, 18:40 - Cindy L: Plus I laugh at everything
4/9/16, 18:40 - Mom: yea, that's the point
4/9/16, 18:40 - Cindy L: Yea if I didn't enjoy it, I wouldn't even do it in the first place
4/9/16, 18:41 - Cindy L: So we can cross willpower off list of potential treatment
4/9/16, 18:41 - Mom: this is why i felt rather shock when the doc at PMH said u have little bit depression
4/9/16, 18:42 - Cindy L: Happy and sad occur together
4/9/16, 18:43 - Mom: like pns and sns
4/9/16, 18:43 - Cindy L: Lol
4/9/16, 18:43 - Mom: ok, take ur time to rest
4/9/16, 18:44 - Cindy L: Really I'm done I'm going to the lib
4/9/16, 18:44 - Mom: open 24 hrs?
4/9/16, 18:44 - Cindy L: Yes
4/9/16, 18:44 - Mom: u want to sleep there?
4/9/16, 18:45 - Mom: don't come back ur dorm at late night time, it's dangerous
4/9/16, 18:45 - Mom: u know there're lots of drunk ppl around
4/9/16, 18:45 - Cindy L: It's Saturday.
4/9/16, 18:46 - Cindy L: Saturday is theatre night I think
4/9/16, 18:46 - Cindy L: Omg I was walking back two days ago
4/9/16, 18:46 - Mom: sigh....
4/9/16, 18:46 - Cindy L: And then this woman climbed out of the car and started puking on the street
4/9/16, 18:46 - Cindy L: Eww
4/9/16, 18:47 - Mom: learn to protect urself
4/9/16, 18:47 - Cindy L: That's why I did tkd for a term
4/9/16, 18:48 - Cindy L: Though the best thing is still to run
4/9/16, 18:48 - Mom: what do u think if the other side r several men????
4/9/16, 18:48 - Mom: u think ur tkd rlly work?
4/9/16, 18:49 - Cindy L: No thats why I say the beat thing is to run
4/9/16, 18:49 - Cindy L: Best
4/9/16, 18:49 - Mom: always rmb: don't put urself in a dangerous situation which u can't manage
4/9/16, 18:49 - Cindy L: Dw I hv spent a lot more time than you hv worrying abt these things
4/9/16, 18:49 - Mom: then u shud better practise running everyday
4/9/16, 18:50 - Mom: i'm not over worrying, i just give adice
4/9/16, 18:50 - Cindy L: Dude. I only ever hang out in holborn
4/9/16, 18:51 - Mom: don't go to eastern london
4/9/16, 18:51 - Cindy L: And the only streets I use are high holborn
4/9/16, 18:51 - Mom: üëç
4/9/16, 18:51 - Mom: and oxford street?
4/9/16, 18:51 - Cindy L: Barely go there.
4/9/16, 18:51 - Cindy L: But main streets.
4/9/16, 18:52 - Mom: üëç
4/9/16, 18:52 - Cindy L: I mean London is not that dangerous for student
4/9/16, 18:52 - Mom: better stay indoor when it's dark
4/9/16, 18:52 - Cindy L: There r designated nights
4/9/16, 18:53 - Cindy L: And if u only go out on student nights it's fine
4/9/16, 18:53 - Mom: ok
4/9/16, 18:53 - Cindy L: I've heard of people getting stabbed in East London but thats not really my business
4/9/16, 18:54 - Cindy L: As long as I'm concerned if I can't get there by foot, I don't even go there.
4/9/16, 18:54 - Mom: but the fact that high holborn has a lot of police patronized is better
4/9/16, 18:54 - Cindy L: Hurr oh yeah they do
4/9/16, 18:55 - Mom: stabbled? student?
4/9/16, 18:55 - Cindy L: I dunno I talked to this guy from ucl who says that ppl get stabbed in East london
4/9/16, 18:55 - Cindy L: But who knows
4/9/16, 18:55 - Mom: better avoid going there
4/9/16, 18:56 - Cindy L: Personally I feel us campus unis seem more dangerous
4/9/16, 18:56 - Cindy L: Cuz its like a campus in the middle of nowhere
4/9/16, 18:56 - Mom: why?
4/9/16, 18:57 - Cindy L: And u always hear abt girls being raped.
4/9/16, 18:57 - Mom: u mean northwestern?
4/9/16, 18:57 - Cindy L: No a lot of us unis are in the middle of nowhere
4/9/16, 18:57 - Cindy L: Such as cornell
4/9/16, 18:57 - Mom: no, columbia is in ny
4/9/16, 18:57 - Mom: ny city
4/9/16, 18:57 - Mom: but still dangerous
4/9/16, 18:57 - Cindy L: Yea Columbia is special for being the city.
4/9/16, 18:58 - Cindy L: Most r in the middle of nowhere.
4/9/16, 18:58 - Mom: it all depends on the quality of the residents there
4/9/16, 18:58 - Cindy L: I dunno
4/9/16, 18:58 - Mom: but r they all students/uni staff living in the campus residency?
4/9/16, 18:58 - Cindy L: But u think just because hey choose smart ppl they will not go around stabbing and raping people
4/9/16, 18:59 - Cindy L: Esp since they hv Greek life
4/9/16, 18:59 - Mom: no, raping used to happen amongst students right?
4/9/16, 18:59 - Cindy L: Yeah exactly
4/9/16, 18:59 - Cindy L: That's why I'm saying closed  campus seems more dangerous
4/9/16, 19:00 - Mom: so don't go alone, always follow groups of ppl
4/9/16, 19:00 - Cindy L: In most rape cases the rapist is someone they know
4/9/16, 19:00 - Cindy L: U know
4/9/16, 19:01 - Mom: so u better stick to ....?
4/9/16, 19:01 - Cindy L: U r less likely to be raped by some weirdo on the street of London
4/9/16, 19:02 - Mom: in fact, ur living in london city not lse campus
4/9/16, 19:02 - Cindy L: And cuz in us they can't drink until 21, everyone wants to be an adult so they drink like crazy when they manage to get their hands on some.
4/9/16, 19:03 - Cindy L: Drinking until u pass out is a sure fire way for bad things to happen to u
4/9/16, 19:03 - Mom: it's rlly important to pick the right person to be ur friend
4/9/16, 19:03 - Cindy L: Even I know that.
4/9/16, 19:03 - Cindy L: U can't depend on ur friend
4/9/16, 19:03 - Mom: why drink lei???
4/9/16, 19:03 - Cindy L: Come on, u barely know this person
4/9/16, 19:04 - Cindy L: Just met them for a few months
4/9/16, 19:04 - Mom: so better not drinking to keep mind clear all the time
4/9/16, 19:04 - Cindy L: Because u want to be an adult.
4/9/16, 19:04 - Mom: drinking doesn't mean adult
4/9/16, 19:04 - Cindy L: Lol I dunno
4/9/16, 19:05 - Mom: i don't have this kind of thought even when i was teenager
4/9/16, 19:05 - Cindy L: Cuz u r a good good kid who goes camping and reads books.
4/9/16, 19:05 - Cindy L: Some kids want to go on an adventure
4/9/16, 19:05 - Cindy L: Some kids want to try new things
4/9/16, 19:06 - Mom: no, i don't read books, i just go camping and sports
4/9/16, 19:06 - Cindy L: Some kids want to make things
4/9/16, 19:06 - Cindy L: Depends on what kind of kod u r
4/9/16, 19:06 - Mom: then find someone with similar interests, don't pick those not relevant person
4/9/16, 19:06 - Cindy L: Kid u r
4/9/16, 19:07 - Cindy L: Suckss when ur circle is small.
4/9/16, 19:07 - Mom: i'm saying u shud pick ur friend having common interest unless u tell me that u like drinking so much
4/9/16, 19:07 - Cindy L: Lol let me tell u abt search theory
4/9/16, 19:07 - Mom: so if ur not that type of person, why stick to the drunk person
4/9/16, 19:08 - Cindy L: The friend searching market is plagued with imperfect information
4/9/16, 19:08 - Mom: u can't make friends with all kinds of person
4/9/16, 19:08 - Cindy L: It takes time, a loooong time, to search for a good friend.
4/9/16, 19:09 - Cindy L: I'm putting my macro knowledge to good use.
4/9/16, 19:09 - Mom: don't need good friend in a short time, just someone sharing similar hobbies and interests
4/9/16, 19:09 - Cindy L: Yah even that is hard
4/9/16, 19:10 - Cindy L: To maximize ur chances of meeting someone like that
4/9/16, 19:10 - Cindy L: U need to attend a lot of social events.
4/9/16, 19:10 - Mom: that's enough, it's no good to make everyone ur friend and in a week ur going to just say goodbye and hi
4/9/16, 19:10 - Cindy L: I know
4/9/16, 19:10 - Cindy L: U need to fill the friend bar
4/9/16, 19:10 - Cindy L: Like sims
4/9/16, 19:11 - Cindy L: I told u making friends is like playing sims
4/9/16, 19:11 - Cindy L: I only managed to play sims regularly for abt two weeks
4/9/16, 19:11 - Mom: ei, social event, that means ur searching for someone with similar interests unless u told me that u have endless interests
4/9/16, 19:11 - Cindy L: I go to societies thats good enough
4/9/16, 19:12 - Mom: my way to make friend is straight forward: same language ok, if not bye
4/9/16, 19:12 - Cindy L: U know its very difficult when ur an international kid
4/9/16, 19:12 - Cindy L: Sorry I mean third culture kid
4/9/16, 19:13 - Mom: this is the way u filter ur friends amongst so many different kinds of persons
4/9/16, 19:13 - Cindy L: It's like ur an alien everywhere
4/9/16, 19:13 - Mom: what alien?
4/9/16, 19:13 - Cindy L: At least if u are korean, Koreans will accept u
4/9/16, 19:13 - Mom: i don't agree that unless all ukers r so narrow minded
4/9/16, 19:13 - Cindy L: Mainland Chinese, Chinese accept u
4/9/16, 19:13 - Cindy L: Speak English, but not actually british
4/9/16, 19:14 - Cindy L: Very hard to fit in.
4/9/16, 19:14 - Cindy L: Sure there r HK ppl
4/9/16, 19:14 - Mom: so better go to locak skl right?
4/9/16, 19:14 - Mom: and go to hk unis?
4/9/16, 19:14 - Cindy L: In some aspects maybe.
4/9/16, 19:14 - Cindy L: But for education ofc go to progressive school
4/9/16, 19:15 - Mom: omg, cultural barrier is so hard to break
4/9/16, 19:15 - Cindy L: Ofc
4/9/16, 19:15 - Cindy L: Esf schools are very progressive schools.
4/9/16, 19:15 - Mom: so how come the mainlander marry westerners so easily?
4/9/16, 19:16 - Cindy L: We complained a lot, but actually got an education
4/9/16, 19:16 - Cindy L: Mainlander marry Westerner?
4/9/16, 19:16 - Cindy L: 1. Really?
4/9/16, 19:17 - Cindy L: 2. There r gold-diggers in every culture
4/9/16, 19:17 - Mom: rmb, ur cousin?
4/9/16, 19:17 - Mom: the one marry a french chef?
4/9/16, 19:17 - Cindy L: 3. Westerners who go to another country would naturally be more open to international culture don't u thinj
4/9/16, 19:17 - Cindy L: 4. He's French
4/9/16, 19:18 - Cindy L: UK people r the most conservative ppl u will every meet.
4/9/16, 19:18 - Mom: i agree
4/9/16, 19:18 - Cindy L: I'm not saying it's impossible to break racial barriers
4/9/16, 19:19 - Cindy L: But ofc it's much easier when u r older
4/9/16, 19:19 - Cindy L: So u see the Masters and PhD students get along with everybody
4/9/16, 19:19 - Cindy L: But undergrad is horrible cuz everyone still in HS mindset and gather around in cliques
4/9/16, 19:19 - Mom: so wait for another couple of yrs
4/9/16, 19:20 - Cindy L: .....
4/9/16, 19:20 - Mom: but topsy seems to get along with her uk friends so well according to her mom said
4/9/16, 19:21 - Cindy L: She went to bordering school ofc
4/9/16, 19:21 - Cindy L: I'm essentially a HK person who speaks english
4/9/16, 19:21 - Mom: perhaps she's been there for a while
4/9/16, 19:21 - Mom: then tell ppl that ur mainlander okay?
4/9/16, 19:21 - Cindy L: .... Wtf
4/9/16, 19:21 - Cindy L: I'm a Hker
4/9/16, 19:21 - Mom: then u can make friends with mainlander
4/9/16, 19:22 - Mom: just joking
4/9/16, 19:22 - Mom: tell ppl ur british cuz ur rlly a british citizen
4/9/16, 19:22 - Cindy L: It's not like I choose to only make friends with Chinese ppl.
4/9/16, 19:23 - Cindy L: I don't think u understand the issue here.
4/9/16, 19:23 - Mom: ofc, i do
4/9/16, 19:23 - Cindy L: It's hard to get a long with Europeans cuz there is nothing it talk abt.
4/9/16, 19:23 - Cindy L: Literally.
4/9/16, 19:23 - Mom: okay do it this way: 1. make friends with chinese first cuz u want accompany
4/9/16, 19:24 - Cindy L: Who says I hv no friends
4/9/16, 19:24 - Mom: 2. make friends with different nationality ppl
4/9/16, 19:24 - Cindy L: Why r we even discussing this.
4/9/16, 19:24 - Mom: 3. kick away those u don't like chinese
4/9/16, 19:25 - Mom: dunno
4/9/16, 19:25 - Cindy L: The lse is inherently a difficult place to make friends.
4/9/16, 19:25 - Cindy L: That's why so many first years can't cope
4/9/16, 19:26 - Mom: i have heard of this in the studentroom
4/9/16, 19:26 - Cindy L: Yah
4/9/16, 19:27 - Cindy L: That's why they all go home over the holiday
4/9/16, 19:28 - Cindy L: And some don't even do societies
4/9/16, 19:28 - Cindy L: I dunno how they manage
4/9/16, 19:28 - Cindy L: Maybe spend everyday in the library
4/9/16, 19:28 - Mom: it's difficult to adapt to lse life bc lse is in the middle of london city, it doesn't have its uni campus
4/9/16, 19:28 - Cindy L: I see a lot of people just sleeping there, chilling
4/9/16, 19:29 - Cindy L: And so many people r only here for one yr
4/9/16, 19:29 - Mom: ppl go there like going to office, how can ppl develop friendship in a work-like enviornment?
4/9/16, 19:29 - Cindy L: Hahaha yah it's like an office
4/9/16, 19:29 - Mom: yea, those exchange student
4/9/16, 19:29 - Cindy L: Yeah so they don't bother
4/9/16, 19:30 - Mom: why wud i bother if i just be there temporarily?
4/9/16, 19:30 - Cindy L: Yah
4/9/16, 19:30 - Cindy L: But it's just different
4/9/16, 19:30 - Cindy L: Cuz everybody does their own stuff, u don't really do anything together
4/9/16, 19:30 - Mom: do u think it's different in ucl or imperial?
4/9/16, 19:30 - Cindy L: Yeah imperial is very dofferent
4/9/16, 19:31 - Mom: bc u meet so little time
4/9/16, 19:31 - Cindy L: My friend from imp I already lost contact with her
4/9/16, 19:31 - Mom: all ppl do same courses?
4/9/16, 19:31 - Cindy L: I lost my imp contact üò†
4/9/16, 19:31 - Cindy L: So angry
4/9/16, 19:32 - Cindy L: Ucl is sort of the same I dunno. People who do natural science r closer cuz they do the same courses and stufd
4/9/16, 19:33 - Mom: so, it's like hs
4/9/16, 19:33 - Cindy L: Yeah
4/9/16, 19:33 - Cindy L: U t√†ke the same classes at the same times.
4/9/16, 19:33 - Mom: doing same courses with same group of ppl is easier to make friendship
4/9/16, 19:33 - Cindy L: That's imperial
4/9/16, 19:34 - Cindy L: Plus they also put u in groups and shit
4/9/16, 19:34 - Mom: not applicable to ucl?
4/9/16, 19:34 - Cindy L: Ucl is lecture only I think
4/9/16, 19:34 - Mom: imperial's like HS style
4/9/16, 19:34 - Cindy L: Well my friend who does chem eng says he only does lecture and labs
4/9/16, 19:34 - Cindy L: Yeah imp is not really like a uni
4/9/16, 19:34 - Cindy L: Plus they work u really hard
4/9/16, 19:35 - Cindy L: With close supervision
4/9/16, 19:35 - Mom: who want to be assigned of everything at uni level?
4/9/16, 19:35 - Cindy L: So u know, like workers in a factory easy to generate this sense of closeness and community
4/9/16, 19:35 - Mom: wow, like apprenticeship?
4/9/16, 19:35 - Cindy L: Yea, tbh not reay my style
4/9/16, 19:36 - Cindy L: Really
4/9/16, 19:36 - Mom: if ur assigned to a group of ppl u don't like, then how can u survive for the rest of the yr?
4/9/16, 19:36 - Cindy L: I'm pretty sure u can change easily
4/9/16, 19:37 - Mom: change group or change uni?
4/9/16, 19:37 - Cindy L: Their counselling is good cuz they had high suicide rates
4/9/16, 19:37 - Cindy L: Group
4/9/16, 19:37 - Mom: why? suicide?
4/9/16, 19:37 - Cindy L: I'm sure if u're unhappy with anything imp will accommodate easily
4/9/16, 19:37 - Mom: at top uni still think of suicide but not grad?
4/9/16, 19:37 - Cindy L: Suicide cuz lots of work
4/9/16, 19:38 - Cindy L: High stress, very competitive
4/9/16, 19:38 - Cindy L: Prof have high expectations
4/9/16, 19:38 - Mom: but they already pick the smartest students right?
4/9/16, 19:38 - Cindy L: Yea so
4/9/16, 19:38 - Cindy L: U can always give itself stress
4/9/16, 19:38 - Cindy L: Urself
4/9/16, 19:39 - Cindy L: I see the 2nd and 3rd here are really stressed too
4/9/16, 19:39 - Mom: but do they present lots of research papers? don't rlly think so
4/9/16, 19:39 - Cindy L: Or maybe I'm just too chilled.
4/9/16, 19:39 - Cindy L: Research? I'm sure they publish a lot. Just don't which field.
4/9/16, 19:40 - Cindy L: Here we mostly read lse stuff
4/9/16, 19:40 - Cindy L: And they like to point out a the Nobel prize winners
4/9/16, 19:40 - Mom: but when u google research papers, i seldom read imperial's paper
4/9/16, 19:40 - Cindy L: Hurr
4/9/16, 19:40 - Cindy L: Google imperial research paper
4/9/16, 19:40 - Cindy L: Or maybe
4/9/16, 19:41 - Cindy L: They work for xompaniesy
4/9/16, 19:41 - Cindy L: Companies
4/9/16, 19:41 - Cindy L: Then u wouldn't see the research
4/9/16, 19:41 - Cindy L: I know in mech eng. A lot of them work in car companies
4/9/16, 19:42 - Mom: so prospect seems a little bit dim
4/9/16, 19:42 - Cindy L: For mech eng?
4/9/16, 19:42 - Cindy L: I guess
4/9/16, 19:42 - Cindy L: But will be able to program
4/9/16, 19:42 - Cindy L: And design
4/9/16, 19:42 - Mom: for work in car industry
4/9/16, 19:42 - Cindy L: If u're smart get an MBA and do enterprise ofx
4/9/16, 19:42 - Cindy L: Ofx
4/9/16, 19:42 - Cindy L: Ofc
4/9/16, 19:43 - Cindy L: Who the hell would go into car industry now
4/9/16, 19:43 - Cindy L: That is career suicide
4/9/16, 19:43 - Mom: everyone can start his business, u don't need an MBA
4/9/16, 19:43 - Cindy L: Yea but it helps
4/9/16, 19:43 - Mom: not rlly
4/9/16, 19:43 - Cindy L: U get an MBA to make contacts
4/9/16, 19:44 - Mom: only in elite uni
4/9/16, 19:44 - Cindy L: Duh how do u start a business without knowing anyone.
4/9/16, 19:44 - Mom: if normal uni, no use
4/9/16, 19:44 - Cindy L: Well ofc u go Harvard business school or sloan
4/9/16, 19:44 - Mom: be a hawker
4/9/16, 19:45 - Mom: or u can run a dessert shop
4/9/16, 19:45 - Cindy L: Dude u know why there r so many successful startups from Stanford?
4/9/16, 19:45 - Cindy L: It's not because those people r smarter.
4/9/16, 19:45 - Cindy L: Or that they hv better skills
4/9/16, 19:45 - Mom: those r high-level persons, ofc they have connection that helps their business
4/9/16, 19:46 - Cindy L: Exactly
4/9/16, 19:46 - Cindy L: They invite Google ceos to lecture
4/9/16, 19:47 - Cindy L: If u want to startup, u just need to talk to Prof and they make a few calls to hook u up with the right people
4/9/16, 19:47 - Mom: don't try to stick to those class of ppl unless ur determined to become a robber
4/9/16, 19:47 - Cindy L: I mean wth
4/9/16, 19:48 - Cindy L: If u want to start up here, u need to pitch to like a billion investors and still would probably get no funding.
4/9/16, 19:48 - Mom: uk govt doesn't support stem projects?
4/9/16, 19:48 - Mom: oh, it's difficult
4/9/16, 19:49 - Cindy L: U know less than 1% of GDP is reserved for R and D
4/9/16, 19:49 - Cindy L: Sorry I meant gov budget.
4/9/16, 19:49 - Mom: u mean in uk?
4/9/16, 19:49 - Cindy L: Yea
4/9/16, 19:49 - Mom: oh, that's why uk stem is so shit
4/9/16, 19:50 - Cindy L: Highest in the world is in Israel
4/9/16, 19:50 - Cindy L: Guess what they research and develop
4/9/16, 19:50 - Mom: where the taxpayers' money gone? to royal family? political parties?
4/9/16, 19:50 - Cindy L: Better weapons to bomb the shit out of the Palestinians on the Gaza strip
4/9/16, 19:51 - Cindy L: That is how fucked up the world is.
4/9/16, 19:51 - Cindy L: Taxpayer money gone to funding the welfare state loh
4/9/16, 19:51 - Mom: too bad ur not man, u better not to work in israel
4/9/16, 19:51 - Cindy L: Israel is the home of Jews üòë
4/9/16, 19:52 - Cindy L: Not arabs ah
4/9/16, 19:52 - Cindy L: OK to be woman in Israel ah
4/9/16, 19:52 - Mom: jews r the god's chosen ppl right?
4/9/16, 19:52 - Cindy L: Lol
4/9/16, 19:52 - Cindy L: Jews r smart
4/9/16, 19:52 - Mom: that's why they're the smartest ppl in the world
4/9/16, 19:53 - Cindy L: Generally ppl in middle East r quite clever
4/9/16, 19:53 - Cindy L: Like Turkish ppl and egyptians
4/9/16, 19:53 - Cindy L: Very smart business wise and math
4/9/16, 19:53 - Cindy L: Too bad poor governments
4/9/16, 19:54 - Mom: no, jews better cuz they're chosen
4/9/16, 19:54 - Cindy L: Sure.
4/9/16, 19:54 - Cindy L: U want to be Jewish now
4/9/16, 19:54 - Mom: i wish i could
4/9/16, 19:55 - Cindy L: I met this Jewish guy in berlin
4/9/16, 19:55 - Cindy L: And he didn't seem like being in Israel very much.
4/9/16, 19:55 - Mom: maybe the political reason?
4/9/16, 19:55 - Cindy L: He says u always gotta watch out for ppl who atab u in the back.
4/9/16, 19:55 - Cindy L: Stab
4/9/16, 19:56 - Mom: cuz lots of political turmoil there
4/9/16, 19:56 - Cindy L: I'm sure he meant metaphorically
4/9/16, 19:56 - Cindy L: But the political matter is between Palestinian and Israeli
4/9/16, 19:56 - Cindy L: They not even the same country
4/9/16, 19:57 - Cindy L: So a foreign policy matter.
4/9/16, 19:57 - Cindy L: That's why ppl in IR love talking abt it
4/9/16, 19:57 - Mom: religion matter
4/9/16, 19:57 - Cindy L: Religion just a pretext ah
4/9/16, 19:58 - Cindy L: Nobody actually bombs the shit out of people cuz their God is different.
4/9/16, 19:59 - Cindy L: Which reminds me
4/9/16, 19:59 - Mom: üòë
4/9/16, 19:59 - Cindy L: I got an unconditional from ucl
4/9/16, 19:59 - Mom: u told me already
4/9/16, 19:59 - Cindy L: For natural sci
4/9/16, 19:59 - Cindy L: Still nothing from bme
4/9/16, 19:59 - Mom: starting with omh
4/9/16, 20:00 - Mom: and then what the hell
4/9/16, 20:00 - Cindy L: Ok
4/9/16, 20:00 - Cindy L: But we haven't discussed it
4/9/16, 20:00 - Mom: what if ucl doesn't allow change to biomed?
4/9/16, 20:00 - Cindy L: I know lah.
4/9/16, 20:01 - Cindy L: That is an issue
4/9/16, 20:01 - Mom: what? they told u already?
4/9/16, 20:01 - Cindy L: It also seems surprising easy to get into ucl.
4/9/16, 20:01 - Cindy L: No, I mean I still don't know if they will let me change streams or not
4/9/16, 20:02 - Cindy L: I mean I'm thinking that they probably hv quota for each stream
4/9/16, 20:02 - Mom: i don't rlly think u won't be offered a place at ucl, cuz who else wud pick natural sci?
4/9/16, 20:02 - Cindy L: It's not natural sci
4/9/16, 20:03 - Cindy L: It's basically a physics and math degree
4/9/16, 20:03 - Cindy L: If I do physics and math, I might as well stay here
4/9/16, 20:03 - Mom: what does the offer letter say?
4/9/16, 20:03 - Cindy L: Er... I haven't read it
4/9/16, 20:03 - Mom: offer of a physics and maths course?
4/9/16, 20:03 - Cindy L: But a lot of ucl's degree programs are weird
4/9/16, 20:04 - Mom: no, there is a natural science degree program
4/9/16, 20:04 - Cindy L: They hv programs where u have to enter by switching in 2nd year
4/9/16, 20:04 - Mom: in which u can choose between different combinations
4/9/16, 20:05 - Cindy L: My point is they don't hv double programs
4/9/16, 20:05 - Mom: i read their webite already
4/9/16, 20:05 - Cindy L: I know lah
4/9/16, 20:05 - Mom: this is not a double degree program
4/9/16, 20:05 - Mom: it's a natural sci deg program with double major
4/9/16, 20:05 - Cindy L: Yeah
4/9/16, 20:06 - Mom: so if offer is physics and maths deg, better to stay in lse if no offer from nu
4/9/16, 20:06 - Mom: actually, if nu offer will u go?
4/9/16, 20:07 - Cindy L: Yah it's northwestern
4/9/16, 20:07 - Cindy L: I paid a lot of money for it.
4/9/16, 20:07 - Mom: hahaha
4/9/16, 20:07 - Mom: u also paid a lot for application to cmu architecture right?
4/9/16, 20:07 - Cindy L: That's true
4/9/16, 20:07 - Cindy L: Lolb
4/9/16, 20:08 - Cindy L: But if I don't accept ucl offer, then I wouldn't know whether I can change to stream with biomed or not
4/9/16, 20:08 - Mom: but it's good u start to think of the cost/value
4/9/16, 20:08 - Cindy L: How do I ask if I can change streams without angering anybody
4/9/16, 20:09 - Mom: why not? u don't have to pay for the ofer right?
4/9/16, 20:09 - Mom: trouble?
4/9/16, 20:09 - Cindy L: No, How do I ask if I can change streams without angering anybody
4/9/16, 20:10 - Mom: i mean trouble finding an hourable excuse
4/9/16, 20:10 - Cindy L: And when would be a good  time to ask is the question
4/9/16, 20:10 - Cindy L: I'm asking these as actual questions
4/9/16, 20:10 - Mom: just see what they say in the offer letter first, to see if there's any restriction on stream changing
4/9/16, 20:11 - Cindy L: But u wouldn't know abt restrictions
4/9/16, 20:11 - Cindy L: U need to ask course manager
4/9/16, 20:11 - Cindy L: I mean if it was admin staff that would be easier to ask
4/9/16, 20:12 - Cindy L: But the course manager is a faculty member
4/9/16, 20:12 - Mom: if they speak plainly in ur offer letter that ur offered a place in the physics and maths deg course, i rlly think there's prob
4/9/16, 20:12 - Cindy L: Ok I'll check later
4/9/16, 20:12 - Cindy L: They haven't even sent me an offer letter
4/9/16, 20:13 - Cindy L: I just saw it update in track
4/9/16, 20:13 - Mom: not in ur ucas track?
4/9/16, 20:13 - Mom: then wait and give me some time to think abt the situation
4/9/16, 20:13 - Cindy L: Kk
4/9/16, 20:13 - Cindy L: Always good to think
4/9/16, 20:14 - Mom: headache
4/9/16, 20:14 - Cindy L: If u think u hv headache what do u think I hv
4/9/16, 20:14 - Mom: migraine
4/9/16, 20:15 - Cindy L: .... Lol
4/9/16, 20:15 - Cindy L: That's is funny
4/9/16, 20:15 - Cindy L: Btw I thought of a reason why u should drink alcohol
4/9/16, 20:16 - Cindy L: Red wine has reservatrol
4/9/16, 20:16 - Mom: to sleep
4/9/16, 20:16 - Cindy L: It's good for neurogenesis
4/9/16, 20:17 - Mom: i prefer playing mahjong
4/9/16, 20:17 - Mom: it always train ur mind
4/9/16, 20:19 - Cindy L: Yea but not gonna help u grow new neurons
4/9/16, 20:20 - Mom: only if u used them, they'll grow
4/9/16, 20:21 - Mom: neurons won't age
4/9/16, 20:21 - Cindy L: I'm not joking ur hippocampus can actually produce new neurons
4/9/16, 20:22 - Mom: i know
4/9/16, 20:22 - Mom: not only the hippocampus, there's also another one next to hippocampus which can grow new neurons as well
4/9/16, 20:23 - Mom: but don't rmb the organ's name now
4/9/16, 20:23 - Cindy L: Oh really
4/9/16, 20:23 - Cindy L: I thought the hippocampus could produce new neurons cuz it needed to encode short term memory
4/9/16, 20:23 - Mom: perhaps, more brain neurons can grow again but scientists just haven't discover yet
4/9/16, 20:24 - Mom: there's one more so far
4/9/16, 20:24 - Cindy L: That's good, they can replace my orexin
4/10/16, 10:53 - Mom: hi
4/10/16, 13:10 - Cindy L: Hi
4/10/16, 13:46 - Mom: doing what?
4/10/16, 17:28 - Cindy L: It takes 11 mins to whip 100ml of fresh cream
4/10/16, 17:29 - Mom: ur making fresh cream?
4/10/16, 17:31 - Cindy L: No i make whipping cream
4/10/16, 17:31 - Mom: for what?
4/10/16, 17:31 - Cindy L: Pancake

4/10/16, 17:32 - Cindy L: Brrrr.
4/10/16, 17:33 - Mom: by hand?
4/10/16, 17:33 - Mom: but chef uses machine?
4/10/16, 17:35 - Cindy L: Yes by hand, I whip with a fork as well
4/10/16, 17:35 - Cindy L: Yea u need an electric beater to make enough cream for a cake.
4/10/16, 17:35 - Mom: u can run a coffee shop if u don't want to work in office
4/10/16, 17:36 - Cindy L: Which means fresh cream cakes are a sign of technological advancement
4/10/16, 17:36 - Mom: no, fresh cream cakes r ppl's loved food
4/10/16, 17:36 - Cindy L: Insight of the day
4/10/16, 17:36 - Mom: why not? ppl even just sell cookies
4/10/16, 17:37 - Cindy L: Cookies r basic
4/10/16, 17:38 - Cindy L: U don't need electrical tools to make cookies.
4/10/16, 17:38 - Mom: u won't eat cookies for everyday meal right?
4/10/16, 17:38 - Cindy L: Mrs. Fields cookies r not worth the price.
4/10/16, 17:38 - Cindy L: No
4/10/16, 17:38 - Mom: ofc la
4/10/16, 17:38 - Cindy L: Unless I can make cookies out of bananas and eggs.
4/10/16, 17:39 - Mom: besides, they're not that yummy
4/10/16, 17:39 - Cindy L: Ya
4/10/16, 17:39 - Cindy L: Also How do u stop bean sprouts from going bad?
4/10/16, 17:40 - Mom: u bought alot everytime?
4/10/16, 17:40 - Cindy L: No pack is that size.
4/10/16, 17:40 - Cindy L: The pack is that sizr
4/10/16, 17:41 - Mom: soak it into water, then it can last for one day
4/10/16, 17:41 - Cindy L: They get slimey after a day or two
4/10/16, 17:42 - Cindy L: I see
4/10/16, 17:42 - Mom: if u put it into the fridge, u have to use all of them by the next day, otherwise, it turns bad
4/10/16, 17:43 - Cindy L: Right
4/10/16, 17:43 - Mom: rmb put them into water
4/10/16, 17:43 - Cindy L: One cannot eat that many beansprouts
4/10/16, 17:43 - Cindy L: What do I fry them with
4/10/16, 17:44 - Mom: what abt cook them all at a time and keep the unfinished into the fridge
4/10/16, 17:44 - Cindy L: They r more ornamental. Like carrots.
4/10/16, 17:44 - Mom: but that also can be kept for 1 more day, i suppose
4/10/16, 17:44 - Cindy L: OK so I cannot keep then for three days
4/10/16, 17:47 - Mom: http://www.wikihow.com/Store-Bean-Sprouts
4/10/16, 17:47 - Mom: check this, it tells u how to keep bean sprouts fresh
4/10/16, 17:47 - Cindy L: I think I should pickle them like the Koreans do
4/10/16, 17:47 - Mom: those bean sprouts will turn yellowish for more than 2 days
4/10/16, 17:48 - Mom: no, u have to put them into water, add few slices of lemon into the water and keep them into the fridge
4/10/16, 17:48 - Mom: if u want fresh bean sprouts
4/10/16, 17:49 - Cindy L: Wow I wish I had that much fridge space
4/10/16, 17:49 - Cindy L: But I'll try that.
4/10/16, 17:49 - Mom: ok, then pickle them like Koreans food
4/10/16, 17:50 - Cindy L: Then I might as well go to assa
4/10/16, 17:50 - Mom: what's that?
4/10/16, 17:50 - Mom: when?
4/10/16, 17:53 - Cindy L: Korean restaurant
4/10/16, 17:53 - Mom: for dinner?
4/10/16, 17:53 - Cindy L: Come out smelling like BBQ meat everytime u go though
4/10/16, 17:54 - Mom: so?
4/10/16, 17:55 - Cindy L: It doesn't smell good
4/10/16, 17:55 - Cindy L: Know what's hard to make
4/10/16, 17:55 - Mom: BBQ meat smells good ah
4/10/16, 17:56 - Cindy L: No ah its the residue smell, the burning of fat which sticks to ur clothes.
4/10/16, 17:56 - Mom: oh
4/10/16, 17:57 - Cindy L: Also Japanese food is quite good here ironically
4/10/16, 17:57 - Mom: just ramen, nothing else
4/10/16, 17:57 - Cindy L: No if u go to restaurant, It's real jap food and not fast food like hk
4/10/16, 17:58 - Mom: and the sashimi r rlly expensive there
4/10/16, 17:58 - Cindy L: Yeah
4/10/16, 17:59 - Cindy L: Even though it's closer to Norway here

4/10/16, 18:05 - Mom: üòë
4/10/16, 18:06 - Cindy L: Cold enough to make me think twice before going out of hh
4/10/16, 18:07 - Cindy L: Don't forget the rain and wind
4/10/16, 18:07 - Mom: oh raining?
4/10/16, 18:07 - Mom: then jog in ur room
4/10/16, 18:07 - Cindy L: Lol.
4/10/16, 18:08 - Cindy L: I spent 20 mins whipping cream
4/10/16, 18:08 - Cindy L: That's good exercise
4/10/16, 18:08 - Mom: anyway, u have nothing to do, why not do exercise?
4/10/16, 18:08 - Mom: hahaha

4/10/16, 18:22 - Cindy L: Before the pancakes
4/10/16, 18:23 - Mom: what? unbelievable?
4/10/16, 18:23 - Mom: u have been sleeping all day?
4/10/16, 18:23 - Mom: no good ah
4/10/16, 18:25 - Cindy L: Now the supermarket is closed and I hv no meat üòÖ
4/10/16, 18:26 - Mom: good, fasting time
4/10/16, 18:45 - Mom: http://hk.apple.nextmedia.com/supplement/wellbeing/art/20160410/19564737
4/10/16, 18:56 - Cindy L: My brain just went crazy again
4/10/16, 18:57 - Cindy L: And it's been a long time after I finished the pancakes.
4/10/16, 18:57 - Cindy L: I had them around 1600
4/10/16, 18:59 - Cindy L: I went crazy at 1840 I think
4/10/16, 19:04 - Mom: what's wrong with it?
4/10/16, 19:05 - Mom: how? like in the video?
4/10/16, 19:06 - Mom: did u put sugar in ur pancake?
4/10/16, 19:07 - Mom: hello? ru there?
4/10/16, 19:13 - Mom: if it's the vagus nerve prob, u still can be affected several hrs after eating
4/10/16, 19:14 - Mom: i rlly think there must be food prob cuz u had more episode in uk than in hk
4/10/16, 19:15 - Mom: why ur phone always can't be connected these couple of weeks?
4/10/16, 19:21 - Mom: üòüüòü
4/10/16, 19:31 - Cindy L: H
4/10/16, 19:31 - Cindy L: I went to get my laundry
4/10/16, 19:31 - Cindy L: I only use banana and egg in my pancake
4/10/16, 19:31 - Cindy L: And then I whipped my own cream
4/10/16, 19:32 - Cindy L: And added raw Cacao powder
4/10/16, 19:32 - Cindy L: That's it.
4/10/16, 19:32 - Cindy L: Oh I also had raspberries
4/10/16, 19:32 - Mom: Cacao powder?
4/10/16, 19:34 - Cindy L: Like cocoa powder
4/10/16, 19:34 - Cindy L: Thats how  u spell it.
4/10/16, 19:35 - Mom: Just googled
4/10/16, 19:36 - Mom: So, how's ur brain crazy?
4/10/16, 19:39 - Cindy L: Like the video
4/10/16, 19:39 - Mom: Saw something again?
4/10/16, 19:40 - Cindy L: No I was reading manga
4/10/16, 19:40 - Cindy L: And then I read three stories instead of one
4/10/16, 19:40 - Cindy L: And I thought that there were 17 possible endings.
4/10/16, 19:40 - Cindy L: So I was like wow, this manga is really creative.
4/10/16, 19:41 - Cindy L: I went back to read it again.
4/10/16, 19:41 - Cindy L: And the stuff I thought I read was completely wrong.
4/10/16, 19:41 - Cindy L: Also I was shaking while reading so I know my brain went cray cray
4/10/16, 19:42 - Mom: Jesus Christ, what's happening?
4/10/16, 19:43 - Mom: So, the messsge ur read in the first time is different from the second one?
4/10/16, 19:45 - Cindy L: Oh yea my heart also suddenly beat slower than normal
4/10/16, 19:45 - Cindy L: So the whole thing goes
4/10/16, 19:46 - Cindy L: I went to put the laundry in the washer
4/10/16, 19:46 - Cindy L: I came back up, decided to read a manga
4/10/16, 19:46 - Cindy L: I was lying on bed and then suddenly I felt my heart beat really loudly twice
4/10/16, 19:47 - Cindy L: It was acting up weirdly so I checked the heart rate
4/10/16, 19:47 - Mom: Any dizzy feeling?
4/10/16, 19:48 - Cindy L: From CPR, they teach u that normal heart is abt the same rate as the beat of 'I will survive'
4/10/16, 19:48 - Cindy L: So I started humming the tune
4/10/16, 19:48 - Cindy L: My heart rate was significantly slower
4/10/16, 19:49 - Cindy L: Sorry the song is 'staying alive'
4/10/16, 19:50 - Cindy L: After that i also started to feel shivers, like small tremours in my arms
4/10/16, 19:50 - Cindy L: My nerves in the head area started stinging
4/10/16, 19:51 - Cindy L: This all basically happens quickly around the same time
4/10/16, 19:51 - Cindy L: Can't exactly remember where the nerves r
4/10/16, 19:51 - Mom: Ur nerve obviously is firing overactively
4/10/16, 19:51 - Cindy L: But they stung pretty badly
4/10/16, 19:52 - Cindy L: Yea
4/10/16, 19:52 - Cindy L: And then when I start shaking with larger movements
4/10/16, 19:52 - Mom: Feeling dizzy or nausea?
4/10/16, 19:52 - Cindy L: That's when the paralysis starts coming in
4/10/16, 19:52 - Cindy L: No nausea
4/10/16, 19:53 - Cindy L: Not sure abt dizzy
4/10/16, 19:53 - Cindy L: I don't even remember what happened exactly after that
4/10/16, 19:53 - Cindy L: But all the way I thought I was reading the story.
4/10/16, 19:53 - Cindy L: And understanding it.
4/10/16, 19:53 - Mom: Conscious all the time?
4/10/16, 19:53 - Cindy L: Yep
4/10/16, 19:54 - Mom: Is the story rlly fuuny?
4/10/16, 19:54 - Cindy L: No it's a tragedy
4/10/16, 19:55 - Cindy L: So I also kept feeling the overactivity in the nerves throughout the whole thing as well
4/10/16, 19:55 - Cindy L: Until it just sort of died down and stopped by itself
4/10/16, 19:56 - Mom: Can't figure out why? But I guess it's ur vagus nerve affecting ur brain which then over-fire
4/10/16, 19:56 - Cindy L: There is an exact moment where I know that it ends
4/10/16, 19:56 - Cindy L: And I can think clearly again.
4/10/16, 19:57 - Mom: So, ur paralyzed for some time?
4/10/16, 19:57 - Cindy L: Not exactly paralysed
4/10/16, 19:57 - Cindy L: Actually I dont know
4/10/16, 19:57 - Cindy L: By that time my brain already turned into scrambled eggs
4/10/16, 19:58 - Mom: U said ur arms shaked, what abt ur lower limbs/body?
4/10/16, 19:58 - Cindy L: I was lying face down on the bed only my arms were propped up
4/10/16, 19:58 - Cindy L: And upper torso
4/10/16, 20:03 - Mom: So, the triggerig event might be ur position?
4/10/16, 20:03 - Cindy L: Dunno
4/10/16, 20:04 - Cindy L: But when I sit upright I get it too?
4/10/16, 20:04 - Mom: Is this the first time u read books with this position on bed and having episode?
4/10/16, 20:04 - Cindy L: Yes
4/10/16, 20:04 - Mom: ü§î
4/10/16, 20:08 - Mom: Think abt this, u have no other emotional triggers, so it must be something from ur trunk - the triggering point, that sent msg to ur brain and made its neuron overfire
4/10/16, 20:09 - Mom: Possible things: food, gesture? Pressure?
4/10/16, 20:10 - Cindy L: I took a dump before it happened
4/10/16, 20:10 - Mom: What dump?
4/10/16, 20:11 - Cindy L: A poop
4/10/16, 20:13 - Mom: normal?
4/10/16, 20:14 - Cindy L: No I had a weird sharp pain before I went to the toilet
4/10/16, 20:14 - Mom: Btw, ru still drinking the ginseng tea and taking the supplements?
4/10/16, 20:14 - Cindy L: Yea I drink the ginseng like water
4/10/16, 20:15 - Mom: Kk
4/10/16, 20:15 - Cindy L: The supplements r finished.
4/10/16, 20:15 - Cindy L: I don't think they were very useful though
4/10/16, 20:15 - Mom: Why u said weird pain?
4/10/16, 20:15 - Cindy L: Like a stomach ache
4/10/16, 20:15 - Cindy L: In the gut area
4/10/16, 20:16 - Mom: Probably the triggering point is the gut
4/10/16, 20:17 - Mom: toxicity or bacteria imbalance within ur gut?
4/10/16, 20:19 - Cindy L: Maybe I should get an endoscope
4/10/16, 20:19 - Cindy L: Endoscopy
4/10/16, 20:19 - Mom: I think so
4/10/16, 20:20 - Mom: That doc at the kwong wah TCM is üëç
4/10/16, 20:20 - Mom: rmb he told us to chk ur gut?
4/10/16, 20:23 - Cindy L: Yah
4/10/16, 20:23 - Cindy L: But how
4/10/16, 20:23 - Mom: Eat more food with probiotics
4/10/16, 20:23 - Cindy L: No to get an endoscopy
4/10/16, 20:24 - Mom: NHS?
4/10/16, 20:24 - Mom: or private doc?
4/10/16, 20:24 - Cindy L: Right.
4/10/16, 20:24 - Cindy L: Another long and painful process
4/10/16, 23:26 - Cindy L: Ok this time a bit different
4/10/16, 23:27 - Cindy L: I had dinner of one giant mushroom baked with garlic and cheese
4/10/16, 23:27 - Cindy L: And bacon rashers
4/10/16, 23:27 - Cindy L: Baked to crispy - American stylw
4/10/16, 23:27 - Cindy L: Then I so had carrots dipped in hummus
4/10/16, 23:28 - Cindy L: Ate at 9pm
4/10/16, 23:29 - Cindy L: Tried to go down to computer room to do work at 2200
4/10/16, 23:31 - Cindy L: I couldn't watch the lecture at all cuz I was sleepy. Not exhausted, but like my mind was in a cloud and I couldn't pay attention to anything
4/10/16, 23:32 - Cindy L: So I gave up and went back to room at 2245
4/10/16, 23:32 - Cindy L: I was cold so I sat by the heater on the floor
4/10/16, 23:34 - Cindy L: And then I didn't open my laptop cuz I thought I was really tired.
4/10/16, 23:34 - Cindy L: So I just sat in the floor
4/10/16, 23:35 - Cindy L: I hallucinated like mad
4/10/16, 23:36 - Cindy L: Until I just woke up
4/10/16, 23:40 - Cindy L: I saw so many people.
4/10/16, 23:42 - Cindy L: No noticeable shaking fit or any over axtive neverss
4/10/16, 23:44 - Mom: Ok, every time after eating
4/10/16, 23:45 - Cindy L: I was still sleepy when I just type this
4/10/16, 23:45 - Cindy L: Now I am % clear
4/10/16, 23:45 - Cindy L: 100%
4/10/16, 23:45 - Cindy L: I can think now
4/10/16, 23:46 - Cindy L: I saw a lot of men this time, which is strange cuz usually  it's only children.
4/10/16, 23:48 - Cindy L: 1. I saw dad standing by the door. He demanded me to get up and go help him open the door.
4/10/16, 23:49 - Cindy L: I said I can't (so there must be some degree of paralysis?) Can't remember exactly why I said that though
4/10/16, 23:50 - Cindy L: 2. I saw Toby? I think.
4/10/16, 23:50 - Cindy L: Sorry forgot to say and then when my dad disappeared I saw toby next
4/10/16, 23:51 - Cindy L: Toby is my HS classmate btw
4/10/16, 23:51 - Cindy L: Anyways he was standing by the door again, waiting for me to open the door for him.
4/10/16, 23:51 - Cindy L: And when I didn't do so, he sort of just complained.
4/10/16, 23:52 - Cindy L: And... Then I don't really remember what happens to him
4/10/16, 23:52 - Cindy L: 3. Saw another guy, can't remember this name or face. Again by the door, waiting for me to to open it
4/10/16, 23:53 - Cindy L: He got really pissed.
4/10/16, 23:53 - Cindy L: By this time I sort of understood they weren't real
4/10/16, 23:54 - Cindy L: I sort of saw him next to the wardrobe, then I blinked a few times, try to look at things differently and then he disappeared
4/10/16, 23:54 - Cindy L: 4. Then I saw my gramps.
4/10/16, 23:55 - Cindy L: Grandpa.
4/10/16, 23:56 - Mom: ok, these r all the hallucinations?
4/10/16, 23:56 - Cindy L: I dunno. I think my eyes were closed.
4/10/16, 23:56 - Cindy L: But when I experienced them I thought I was awake.
4/10/16, 23:57 - Mom: other than "seeing", can u "hear" them saying?
4/10/16, 23:57 - Cindy L: The grandpa one was the strange one.
4/10/16, 23:57 - Cindy L: Yes ofc
4/10/16, 23:58 - Cindy L: He brought abacuses and taught me how to use them
4/10/16, 23:58 - Mom: who's grandpa? my dad or ur dad's dad?
4/10/16, 23:58 - Cindy L: And then he showed me how to roll incense sticks.
4/10/16, 23:58 - Cindy L: Dad's dad
4/10/16, 23:59 - Cindy L: And then, I tried to do it myself.
4/11/16, 00:00 - Cindy L: Then u popped up out of nowhere and said something along the lines of becareful of these strange things.
4/11/16, 00:01 - Cindy L: Hearing the caution, I kind of became more awake? And then grandpa disappeared
4/11/16, 00:02 - Cindy L: Last one was pretty much a dream, I saw myself stuck in a video game.
4/11/16, 00:02 - Cindy L: One more strange thing
4/11/16, 00:03 - Cindy L: At some point, I "picked up" my phone to try to take a picture.
4/11/16, 00:03 - Cindy L: I held the phone in front of me and when I "closed my eyes", I could still see it.
4/11/16, 00:04 - Cindy L: Does that mean I was probably dreaming?
4/11/16, 00:04 - Cindy L: Anyways I woke up after the fifth dream
4/11/16, 00:05 - Cindy L: And then sat on the bed.
4/11/16, 00:06 - Cindy L: I immediately started to write down everything but I think u can see that I still fell asleep once
4/11/16, 00:06 - Cindy L: I didn't know I fell asleep until I woke up
4/11/16, 00:07 - Mom: can u find u pic of urself inside ur phone?
4/11/16, 00:08 - Cindy L: No
4/11/16, 00:08 - Cindy L: The phone I saw looked more like a graphic calculator
4/11/16, 00:09 - Cindy L: OK by then I was dreaming
4/11/16, 00:09 - Mom: so probably u were just sleeping and having dreams from the first man u saw/
4/11/16, 00:09 - Cindy L: Yea.
4/11/16, 00:10 - Cindy L: No
4/11/16, 00:10 - Cindy L: ?
4/11/16, 00:10 - Cindy L: The first three, when I talk to them, I found myself saying stuff out loud
4/11/16, 00:11 - Mom: but the time passed throughout this hallucination period is quite long?
4/11/16, 00:11 - Cindy L: Yea
4/11/16, 00:11 - Cindy L: Agreed
4/11/16, 00:11 - Mom: so possibly dreaming?
4/11/16, 00:12 - Cindy L: I guess
4/11/16, 00:12 - Cindy L: But it was like life
4/11/16, 00:12 - Mom: and u said u felt cold, possibly u felt asleep that u didn't notice?
4/11/16, 00:13 - Mom: weird that seems everyone u saw comes from ur closed circles?
4/11/16, 00:14 - Mom: what happen now?
4/11/16, 00:15 - Mom: can't transmit msg again?
4/11/16, 00:15 - Mom: out? sleep?
4/11/16, 00:15 - Cindy L: H
4/11/16, 00:16 - Cindy L: But the reason I fell asleep was that I was suddenly very sleepy
4/11/16, 00:17 - Cindy L: But I woke up in the afternoon today, it doesn't make sense for me to be sleepy.
4/11/16, 02:52 - Cindy L: Hi
4/11/16, 02:52 - Cindy L: So I went to sleep and the dream continued
4/11/16, 00:23 - Mom: when u woke up from that hallucination episode, were u tired or refresh?
4/11/16, 00:25 - Mom: i think it's the food/digestion process that push u into this sleep state and with weird hallucinations?
4/11/16, 00:26 - Mom: how can u sleep until afternoon? how long exactly u've slept last night?
4/11/16, 00:27 - Mom: and u rlly slept for the whole period?
4/11/16, 02:53 - Cindy L: I was in this jail cell environment
4/11/16, 02:54 - Cindy L: And there was a press release, where a lady was giving a speech for her resignment
4/11/16, 02:55 - Cindy L: She explained why I saw those five people, but it didn't make much sense and I can't remember what it was.
4/11/16, 02:55 - Cindy L: Lol this is not, the five people u meet in heaven
4/11/16, 02:56 - Cindy L: After she finished talking, everyone left and disappeared
4/11/16, 02:57 - Cindy L: And I could move freely and explore the cell
4/11/16, 02:58 - Cindy L: Like a lucid dream
4/11/16, 02:58 - Cindy L: Not in a very good dream though
4/11/16, 03:09 - Mom: err....
4/11/16, 03:09 - Mom: weird???
4/11/16, 03:10 - Mom: how often do u drink ginseng tea? i mean how many cups everyday?
4/11/16, 04:05 - Cindy L: Dunno one or two
4/11/16, 04:07 - Mom: did u sleep?
4/11/16, 04:08 - Mom: take a rest first, i'll take to u later in the day
4/11/16, 11:55 - Mom: hello
4/11/16, 12:19 - Cindy L: Hi
4/11/16, 12:19 - Cindy L: Haha I see u don't bother to try earlier now.
4/11/16, 12:19 - Mom: just woke up?
4/11/16, 12:19 - Mom: ofc la
4/11/16, 12:20 - Mom: cuz u always sleep so late at night time
4/11/16, 12:27 - Cindy L: No I slept at 1 last night
4/11/16, 12:27 - Mom: but u still talked to me at 4/
4/11/16, 12:28 - Cindy L: Cuz I can't sleep for extended periods.
4/11/16, 12:28 - Mom: no, at 0250?
4/11/16, 12:29 - Cindy L: Yea I woke up
4/11/16, 12:29 - Cindy L: I went to bed at one
4/11/16, 12:29 - Mom: this is so bad!!!
4/11/16, 12:29 - Cindy L: Woke up once
4/11/16, 12:29 - Cindy L: Twice
4/11/16, 12:30 - Cindy L: I text once when I wake up during the night
4/11/16, 12:30 - Cindy L: And then in the morning I woke up once or twice I think
4/11/16, 12:30 - Mom: yea, abt 3
4/11/16, 12:30 - Mom: no more bad dream after 3?
4/11/16, 12:30 - Cindy L: So my sleep duration is from 0100 to 1100
4/11/16, 12:31 - Cindy L: No I took some l theanine cuz I felt a bit paranoid
4/11/16, 12:31 - Cindy L: And then I slept better
4/11/16, 12:32 - Cindy L: Still had dream though
4/11/16, 12:34 - Mom: feel better now?
4/11/16, 14:04 - Cindy L: Yeah the theanine promotes gaba
4/11/16, 14:05 - Cindy L: So it helps my brain relax
4/11/16, 14:05 - Cindy L: I was worried it might cripple me the next day, but so far so good
4/11/16, 14:09 - Mom: by the time u had ur crazy hallucainations yestereday, can u hear the cars passing by outside ur window?
4/11/16, 14:10 - Cindy L: No
4/11/16, 14:10 - Cindy L: The window was closed
4/11/16, 14:11 - Mom: if completely closed, then can't hear the traffic sound normally?
4/11/16, 14:11 - Mom: i was thinking u might have actually felt asleep b4 u had ur hallucinations??
4/11/16, 14:12 - Mom: therefore, those might not be hallucinations, instead u were just dreaming?
4/11/16, 14:16 - Cindy L: I'm not sure what exactly they r or how classsify a hallucination
4/11/16, 14:16 - Cindy L: The ones in the beginning felt more like hallucinations
4/11/16, 14:16 - Mom: nvm, i am also confused by ur state of mind events
4/11/16, 14:17 - Mom: right, but isn't it weird that part 2 of that episode looked like a continuum of a dream?
4/11/16, 14:19 - Mom: and i was thinking if u can repeat last night's menu without mushroom, garlic and ginseng tea to see if same events happen again?
4/11/16, 14:20 - Mom: given u said ur BP and HR were affected, i wud guess they're the effect of the VN being stimulated?
4/11/16, 14:40 - Cindy L: Er without mushroom there is no dinner
4/11/16, 14:40 - Cindy L: I hv steak tonight see what happens.
4/11/16, 14:40 - Cindy L: Yea I looked up the vagus, sounds like it.
4/11/16, 14:41 - Cindy L: Just had lunch at 1330, then  slept in library for 40 mins
4/11/16, 14:41 - Mom: just try, i want to see if mushroom is the cause??
4/11/16, 14:41 - Cindy L: Didn't even bother to work.
4/11/16, 14:41 - Cindy L: OK, I'll have a steak or pork chop or something.
4/11/16, 14:42 - Mom: have u ever fasted for 12 hrs and still have hallucinations or other events?
4/11/16, 14:42 - Cindy L: No
4/11/16, 14:42 - Cindy L: As long as I don't eat I'm fine.
4/11/16, 14:43 - Cindy L: Though in yr 13 there were episodes I wasn't sure of the cause
4/11/16, 14:43 - Cindy L: I.e. the pen cap swallowing incident.
4/11/16, 14:43 - Cindy L: I rmb that happened before dinner.
4/11/16, 14:43 - Mom: so, we can figure it's the food which trigger these events right?
4/11/16, 14:44 - Mom: next step is to find what food create this stimulus and how??
4/11/16, 14:45 - Cindy L: Yea
4/11/16, 14:45 - Cindy L: Im also pretty sure its the vagus cuz
4/11/16, 14:46 - Cindy L: When I attempt to control mild weakness
4/11/16, 14:46 - Cindy L: I basically do abdominal breathing.
4/11/16, 14:47 - Mom: that's why i guess it's the vagus cuz it affects breathing, BP, HR, digestion and quite alot more
4/11/16, 14:47 - Cindy L: Yar it's the pns
4/11/16, 14:48 - Cindy L: ü§î
4/11/16, 14:48 - Cindy L: I think I said a long time ago it was the pns
4/11/16, 14:48 - Cindy L: Need to review notes
4/11/16, 14:48 - Mom: u told that u've a while wih less hallucinations, can u rmb what food u eat at the period?
4/11/16, 14:49 - Cindy L: The same
4/11/16, 14:49 - Mom: what abt the duration u ate only crap ramen?
4/11/16, 14:49 - Cindy L: I didn't only eat crap ramen
4/11/16, 14:50 - Cindy L: I had soba noodle and crabs sticks.
4/11/16, 14:50 - Mom: yea, i mean crap meat + ramen
4/11/16, 14:51 - Cindy L: I dunno, there were less? I'm not sure. It's not so definite like a food allergy.
4/11/16, 14:51 - Mom: any serious events happened?
4/11/16, 14:51 - Cindy L: Lemme look back
4/11/16, 14:51 - Cindy L: OK this is the week before period
4/11/16, 14:52 - Mom: it's not allergy but def the food which trigger VN to overactive and then affect the brain fire overactively?
4/11/16, 14:52 - Cindy L: Last logged hallucination was 15/03
4/11/16, 14:53 - Cindy L: That was at night
4/11/16, 14:53 - Cindy L: More like sleep para
4/11/16, 14:53 - Cindy L: Didn't log the week after, so nothing much happened
4/11/16, 14:53 - Cindy L: Need to check chat archive as well
4/11/16, 15:22 - Cindy L: OK
4/11/16, 15:23 - Cindy L: I talked abt being on the soba diet three weeks ago
4/11/16, 15:23 - Cindy L: And suggested that it was cause of hallucinations
4/11/16, 15:23 - Cindy L: So it's doesn't look like type of food matters.
4/11/16, 15:27 - Cindy L: Seem to slip into napping/ rem pretty consistently after porridge bkf
4/11/16, 15:31 - Mom: so need to nap/rem every time after eating?
4/11/16, 15:32 - Mom: no matter which particular type of food?
4/11/16, 15:33 - Mom: if it wasn't which type of food, then it must be something? in the digestion process that overstimulate ur NV and cause these rem/hallucinations???
4/11/16, 15:34 - Mom: sleep disorder seems nothing related to digestion???
4/11/16, 16:50 - Cindy L: Ok I just check all records from past two weeks
4/11/16, 16:51 - Cindy L: So I suggested it was the vagus nerve on the 19th
4/11/16, 16:51 - Cindy L: Of march
4/11/16, 16:52 - Cindy L: And then sort of forgot abt it cuz I was distracted by epigenes and lse100
4/11/16, 16:53 - Cindy L: Anyways I notice hallucinations seem to decline the weeks I took the cholinergic supplement
4/11/16, 16:53 - Cindy L: I barely took if for two weeks so will need to trial again.
4/11/16, 16:55 - Cindy L: Hallucinations decreased but seem to hv more disorientation on waking
4/11/16, 16:55 - Cindy L: Also super tired.
4/11/16, 16:55 - Cindy L: Suspect this maybe increased acetylcholine may increase sws
4/11/16, 16:56 - Cindy L: No record of vivid dreaming for two weeks either.
4/11/16, 16:56 - Cindy L: And then I changed to the low sugar diet on 26th
4/11/16, 16:56 - Mom: if increased sws, u shud get more restful sleep and shudn't be super tired upon awakening?
4/11/16, 16:57 - Cindy L: Hmmm
4/11/16, 16:57 - Cindy L: Not sure, need to read more abt sws
4/11/16, 16:57 - Cindy L: But I'm waking up in the middle of sws cycles.
4/11/16, 16:57 - Cindy L: Whenever u wake up in the middle of a cycle u will feel tired.
4/11/16, 16:57 - Mom: i thought u were still on those acetylcholine supplements and ginseng, so i always ask what supplements ur still on?
4/11/16, 16:58 - Mom: if wake up in the middle of sws, u shud be disorientated
4/11/16, 16:58 - Cindy L: I stopped taking the choline ones a while ago. Properly since I woke up late and forgot to do so
4/11/16, 16:59 - Cindy L: I take the ginseng cuz I hv nothing else to drink
4/11/16, 16:59 - Cindy L: So anyways
4/11/16, 16:59 - Mom: maybe continue for 2 more weeks to see how ur body react?
4/11/16, 16:59 - Cindy L: Changed diet on 26/03
4/11/16, 16:59 - Cindy L: Still fine
4/11/16, 16:59 - Mom: in fact, ur consumption of ginseng tea won't cause much trouble
4/11/16, 17:00 - Cindy L: Had period - so hormones influence resuly
4/11/16, 17:00 - Cindy L: Result
4/11/16, 17:00 - Cindy L: 01/04 - had episode where there was fall in hr
4/11/16, 17:00 - Mom: if consumed too much and for a long time might produce excitatory effect of ur nerve
4/11/16, 17:01 - Cindy L: That's when the vivid dreams returned
4/11/16, 17:01 - Mom: consuming ginseng cause return of vivid dream?
4/11/16, 17:01 - Cindy L: No shuddup
4/11/16, 17:02 - Cindy L: 02/04 - I suspect I may hv had a bout of inflammation
4/11/16, 17:02 - Cindy L: I complained abt a persistent itch and headache in the afternoon
4/11/16, 17:03 - Cindy L: Then on 03/04 - I had stir fry vermicelli and I had IBS after that
4/11/16, 17:03 - Cindy L: We thought it was garlic or onion or sesame oil
4/11/16, 17:04 - Cindy L: I don't think so
4/11/16, 17:04 - Cindy L: And then the week after I had a lot of hallucinations
4/11/16, 17:04 - Mom: obvious it's ur NV being affected or inflamed??
4/11/16, 17:05 - Cindy L: Yea
4/11/16, 17:05 - Cindy L: And we identify when it happenes too
4/11/16, 17:05 - Mom: which cause effect on ur brain neuron overeacted
4/11/16, 17:05 - Cindy L: Question is how
4/11/16, 17:05 - Cindy L: How do u cause NV to be inflamed?
4/11/16, 17:05 - Mom: start from the fry vermicelli, u had IBS
4/11/16, 17:06 - Mom: imbalance of gut bacteria
4/11/16, 17:06 - Cindy L: No NV was inflamed the day BEFORE the stir fry
4/11/16, 17:06 - Cindy L: Or maybe even before that
4/11/16, 17:07 - Cindy L: What CAUSED the drop in hr is the question
4/11/16, 17:07 - Mom: u had itchy skin which might be the result of increased histamine
4/11/16, 17:07 - Mom: ur NV may affect ur HR and BP
4/11/16, 17:07 - Cindy L: This is not first time my hr drop
4/11/16, 17:08 - Cindy L: Ive had it for a loooong time
4/11/16, 17:08 - Cindy L: I used to get it when I played tennis
4/11/16, 17:08 - Cindy L: So it could be that there has always been chronic inflammation of my nv
4/11/16, 17:08 - Mom: so ur vagus nerve might have prob for quite a long time that we didn't notice until now
4/11/16, 17:09 - Cindy L: Which would make sense why I developed narco
4/11/16, 17:09 - Mom: rmb that u always complain abt gut bloating?
4/11/16, 17:09 - Cindy L: Yah but IBS is only symptoms
4/11/16, 17:09 - Cindy L: It seems to be that change in hr is the first signal
4/11/16, 17:10 - Mom: yea, gut bacteria imbalance until a point that IBS symptoms appear
4/11/16, 17:11 - Cindy L: Why u so fixated on gut bacteria I don't get it.
4/11/16, 17:12 - Mom: rmb that in dec15, after antibiotics course, u said u didn't feel so tired for the jan??
4/11/16, 17:14 - Cindy L: This year?
4/11/16, 17:13 - Mom: gut bacteria imbalance cause bloating, and might lead to gut inflammation
4/11/16, 17:13 - Mom: rmb the vagus nerve connect from ur brain to ur gut and can affect a number of different system on ur body
4/11/16, 17:14 - Cindy L: That's true..
4/11/16, 17:14 - Mom: this is my reasoning, not firm believe or whatever
4/11/16, 17:14 - Cindy L: ü§î
4/11/16, 17:15 - Mom: ü§îü§îü§îü§îü§î
4/11/16, 17:15 - Cindy L: I did sleep less in jan
4/11/16, 17:15 - Mom: and u sleep alot this month right?
4/11/16, 17:15 - Cindy L: OK I need to work out what happened on April 1
4/11/16, 17:15 - Cindy L: And go through more records
4/11/16, 17:16 - Mom: this is the only logical reasoning i can think of abt ur disorders so far???
4/11/16, 17:17 - Cindy L: But how does NV inflammation link with gut bacterial imbalance?
4/11/16, 17:20 - Mom: ur vagus nerve connects the brain to ur gut
4/11/16, 17:21 - Cindy L: Yea, r u suggesting that the NV controls the balance of bacteria?
4/11/16, 17:22 - Mom: ofc not controlling
4/11/16, 17:23 - Mom: bloating is a kind of showing bacteria imbalance in ur gut
4/11/16, 17:23 - Cindy L: No it could be possible.
4/11/16, 17:23 - Cindy L: That the brain controls population of bacteria.
4/11/16, 17:23 - Cindy L: Omg
4/11/16, 17:23 - Mom: and diet do affect ur gut's bacteria formation, i think
4/11/16, 17:24 - Cindy L: That's how the immune system comes into play!
4/11/16, 17:24 - Mom: the brain doesn't control ur gut's bacteria
4/11/16, 17:24 - Cindy L: Yes it cam
4/11/16, 17:24 - Cindy L: Can
4/11/16, 17:24 - Cindy L: Though the immune system
4/11/16, 17:25 - Cindy L: No....
4/11/16, 17:25 - Mom: ur body operates as a bottom up system? or top down?
4/11/16, 17:25 - Cindy L: Then it's probably an immune problem.
4/11/16, 17:25 - Cindy L: The immune system fails to maintain a healthy population of bacteria in the GI tract
4/11/16, 17:26 - Cindy L: Which causes the NV to be chronically inflammed
4/11/16, 17:26 - Cindy L: This is a plausible explanation
4/11/16, 17:27 - Mom: why immune system trigger the change? just idiopathic?
4/11/16, 17:27 - Cindy L: It didn't change
4/11/16, 17:27 - Cindy L: It was always like this
4/11/16, 17:27 - Cindy L: Think abt it
4/11/16, 17:27 - Cindy L: I hv eczema - already an autoimmune condition
4/11/16, 17:27 - Cindy L: I have relative who had gut cancer
4/11/16, 17:28 - Mom: i mean why in the first place, ur immune system works?
4/11/16, 17:28 - Cindy L: No surprising that my GI tract is constantly inflamed.
4/11/16, 17:28 - Mom: there must be something which trigger the immune system to work
4/11/16, 17:28 - Mom: ur GI tract inflamed, since when?
4/11/16, 17:28 - Cindy L: No u r assuming that something caused my immune system to go wrong.
4/11/16, 17:28 - Mom: long long ago?
4/11/16, 17:29 - Cindy L: I'm saying that since birth I had an abnormal immune system
4/11/16, 17:29 - Cindy L: Cuz genetic
4/11/16, 17:29 - Mom: physics: newton law #1
4/11/16, 17:29 - Cindy L: That's physics üòë
4/11/16, 17:30 - Mom: i don't think u had abnormal immune system since born
4/11/16, 17:30 - Cindy L: That's what u think
4/11/16, 17:30 - Cindy L: What u think is not fact
4/11/16, 17:30 - Mom: genetic only tells the possibility of disposition, if nothing trigger then nothing shud happen
4/11/16, 17:30 - Cindy L: Look at what denial does.
4/11/16, 17:31 - Cindy L: Yo, simple example
4/11/16, 17:31 - Cindy L: Ur genes dictate u hv brown eyes, u won't suddenly get blue eyes right?
4/11/16, 17:31 - Cindy L: Just accept it.
4/11/16, 17:32 - Cindy L: Thank God I discover this early or else I might hv gut cancer.
4/11/16, 17:33 - Mom: ur right, ur genes dictate u hv brown eyes, u won't suddenly get blue eyes, but if u suddenly get blue eyes, this must mean ur genes r having mutation, and this is the triggering events of the change
4/11/16, 17:36 - Cindy L: Yo I'm not saying I had a mutation
4/11/16, 17:37 - Cindy L: Abnormal immunity runs in the family
4/11/16, 17:37 - Cindy L: It's the dominant genotype
4/11/16, 17:51 - Cindy L: OK I thought abt it again
4/11/16, 17:51 - Cindy L: I see what u mean
4/11/16, 17:54 - Cindy L: If antibiotics r effective that must mean that my immune system is struggling to get rid of a certain type of bacteria
4/11/16, 17:54 - Cindy L: Or microbe
4/11/16, 17:55 - Cindy L: And not the other way round
4/11/16, 17:56 - Cindy L: The microbe stays there and when enough of them accumulates, to pass the threshold, then triggers autoimmune response which is inflammation of the nv
4/11/16, 17:56 - Cindy L: Which means it's food intolerance
4/11/16, 17:57 - Cindy L: What is in all foods but in an amount small enough that it takes a while to build up?
4/11/16, 17:57 - Mom: maybe, but we've to test
4/11/16, 17:57 - Cindy L: Yah
4/11/16, 17:58 - Mom: that's why i ask u to repeat those recipe causing hallucinations/dream by eliminating some of the ingredients every time
4/11/16, 17:59 - Cindy L: Kk
4/11/16, 17:59 - Mom: the best way is to eat single type of food and add another one by one, but this is still very difficult to carry out bc there're lots other additives
4/11/16, 18:00 - Cindy L: Best way is to go in an IV
4/11/16, 18:01 - Mom: then u hv to go to hospital again?
4/11/16, 18:16 - Cindy L: Sorry I had an episode agains
4/11/16, 18:16 - Cindy L: Again
4/11/16, 18:16 - Mom: hallucination?
4/11/16, 18:16 - Cindy L: No the heart thing
4/11/16, 18:17 - Mom: increased HR?
4/11/16, 18:17 - Cindy L: Decrease
4/11/16, 18:17 - Cindy L: It's a drop
4/11/16, 18:17 - Cindy L: When it does so I also heard it so loudly in my chest and head
4/11/16, 18:18 - Cindy L: And then my head gets this dizzy feeling
4/11/16, 18:18 - Mom: what did u hear in ur chest and head?
4/11/16, 18:18 - Cindy L: Heart beating
4/11/16, 18:18 - Cindy L: Like very tense pumping
4/11/16, 18:18 - Mom: wow
4/11/16, 18:18 - Cindy L: I worry it might pump itself out and collapse or something.
4/11/16, 18:18 - Cindy L: Intense
4/11/16, 18:18 - Mom: HR decreases, dizzy feeling and then?
4/11/16, 18:19 - Cindy L: Low blood pressure I think
4/11/16, 18:19 - Cindy L: Then I go lie down wait for it to pass
4/11/16, 18:19 - Mom: ofc, that's why u feel dizzy
4/11/16, 18:19 - Mom: it's vagus nerve again
4/11/16, 18:19 - Cindy L: Yep, I also mentioned that I saw rainbow light
4/11/16, 18:20 - Cindy L: Like a few weeks ago
4/11/16, 18:20 - Mom: just the minute?
4/11/16, 18:20 - Mom: yep
4/11/16, 18:20 - Cindy L: Yea that happens when I get a fall in hr
4/11/16, 18:20 - Cindy L: Except I don't normally go blind
4/11/16, 18:20 - Cindy L: I used to have it after tennis and I thought it was the floodlights causing it
4/11/16, 18:21 - Cindy L: It lasts for quite a long time.
4/11/16, 18:21 - Mom: what happen or u were doing immediate before ur HR decreases?
4/11/16, 18:21 - Cindy L: Er I walked back from lib
4/11/16, 18:21 - Cindy L: And then I lie on my bed
4/11/16, 18:21 - Cindy L: And then I texted a bit
4/11/16, 18:21 - Cindy L: And I got it
4/11/16, 18:21 - Mom: u mean u saw rainbow light for quite a long time?
4/11/16, 18:22 - Cindy L: No I mean after the episode of low hr, it would normally see rainbow light in the corner of my eye
4/11/16, 18:22 - Cindy L: This is back then
4/11/16, 18:23 - Mom: u walked very fast?
4/11/16, 18:23 - Mom: or ur hungry?
4/11/16, 18:23 - Cindy L: Neither
4/11/16, 18:23 - Cindy L: Not really hungry.
4/11/16, 18:23 - Cindy L: I don't think walked that fast
4/11/16, 18:24 - Mom: i'll google what possible cause for sudden HR drop
4/11/16, 18:26 - Cindy L: My chest still feels really uncomfortable
4/11/16, 18:26 - Mom: difficult to breathe?
4/11/16, 18:27 - Cindy L: No it's like after u do a lot of exercise and ur chest is kind of tight
4/11/16, 18:28 - Mom: that's lack of oxygen, and u need a lot of exygen
4/11/16, 18:28 - Cindy L: Oh yea like suffocation
4/11/16, 18:29 - Mom: this is logical, ur heart rate decreases, oxygen pumps less into ur lung and ur brain, the consequences r dizziness and difficult to breathe
4/11/16, 18:33 - Cindy L: Wait I thought of how to describe the heart pumping
4/11/16, 18:33 - Cindy L: Like it's struggling to pump
4/11/16, 18:34 - Cindy L: Like it might stop anytime.
4/11/16, 18:34 - Cindy L: That's why I hump it a few times
4/11/16, 18:34 - Cindy L: No thump
4/11/16, 18:34 - Cindy L: Not hump lol
4/11/16, 18:34 - Cindy L: U know sort of like self administered cpr
4/11/16, 18:35 - Mom: yea, i got that

4/11/16, 18:35 - Mom: no
4/11/16, 18:36 - Cindy L: Oh u meant u understand
4/11/16, 18:36 - Mom: i got what u mean but in don't have this experience
4/11/16, 18:36 - Mom: i just had needle pinch of my chest several times b4
4/11/16, 18:38 - Mom: did u check the hr when u had the episode?
4/11/16, 18:38 - Cindy L: When just now?
4/11/16, 18:38 - Mom: yea, just now?

4/11/16, 18:39 - Cindy L: To 1815
4/11/16, 18:39 - Cindy L: Maybe it could be position
4/11/16, 18:40 - Cindy L: Cuz tilt table test they don't do extreme positions
4/11/16, 18:40 - Cindy L: They just tilt u a little bit
4/11/16, 18:41 - Cindy L: Oh btw

4/11/16, 18:43 - Cindy L: Hmmm well when I go to pret (they do organic food) - episodes and sleepiness occur
4/11/16, 18:43 - Cindy L: But if I go to say burger King or kfc
4/11/16, 18:43 - Cindy L: Nothing.
4/11/16, 18:43 - Mom: then it's food

4/11/16, 19:06 - Cindy L: Yea 9 I think.
4/11/16, 19:06 - Mom: or 10?
4/11/16, 19:07 - Cindy L: I remember going after challenge week once
4/11/16, 19:07 - Cindy L: And I was carrying a ton of stuff
4/11/16, 19:07 - Mom: challenge week to china?
4/11/16, 19:08 - Cindy L: No I went to festii on the last day
4/11/16, 19:08 - Cindy L: So not yr 10
4/11/16, 19:08 - Cindy L: Yr 9 was science abuse
4/11/16, 19:08 - Mom: so?
4/11/16, 19:08 - Cindy L: Must be yr 8
4/11/16, 19:09 - Cindy L: I'm thinking of my fitness lvl compared to the amount of exercise I did
4/11/16, 19:09 - Cindy L: Where did I go in yr 11?
4/11/16, 19:09 - Mom: china?
4/11/16, 19:10 - Cindy L: Yr 11 was China
4/11/16, 19:10 - Cindy L: Yr 10 was windsurfing
4/11/16, 19:10 - Cindy L: Must be yr 8 then
4/11/16, 19:10 - Cindy L: Wow I was swimming in yr 8
4/11/16, 19:10 - Mom: wow, ur memory is so good
4/11/16, 19:10 - Mom: unlike in yr8??
4/11/16, 19:10 - Cindy L: I just need the markers to locate my memories
4/11/16, 19:11 - Cindy L: Cuz they r like random scenes in my head
4/11/16, 19:11 - Mom: perhaps those were ur stories, therefore u can rmb them well
4/11/16, 19:11 - Cindy L: Probs
4/11/16, 19:11 - Cindy L: Anyways
4/11/16, 19:12 - Cindy L: I must hv swam for at least two years right
4/11/16, 19:12 - Mom: yea
4/11/16, 19:12 - Mom: no?
4/11/16, 19:12 - Cindy L: Right so it might not be tennis
4/11/16, 19:12 - Cindy L: Might hv been swimming
4/11/16, 19:13 - Mom: u've been playing tennis for quite a long time
4/11/16, 19:13 - Cindy L: Cuz in yr 10 or 9 my fitness lvl was at max, top notch
4/11/16, 19:13 - Cindy L: It's not the tennis, swinging a stupid racket around won't do anything plus I wasn't even that good at it
4/11/16, 19:14 - Cindy L: It was the fitness sessions which I think could hv helped
4/11/16, 19:14 - Cindy L: We didn't do any of that in VB that's why we were shit
4/11/16, 19:15 - Cindy L: Woe maybe playing the flute was a good idea.
4/11/16, 19:15 - Mom: so keep swimming la
4/11/16, 19:15 - Cindy L: So by chance we made a lot of right decisions
4/11/16, 19:16 - Mom: we can't make every choice a perfect choice right?
4/11/16, 19:16 - Mom: if so, u don't learn from mistakes ma
4/11/16, 19:17 - Cindy L: True
4/11/16, 19:17 - Cindy L: But tragic
4/11/16, 19:17 - Cindy L: This is a case of one mistake destroying a good picture
4/11/16, 19:18 - Mom: why tragic? it's a learning experience
4/11/16, 19:18 - Cindy L: Because my cataplectic symptoms r permanent?
4/11/16, 19:19 - Cindy L: That's quite a costly school fee isn't it
4/11/16, 19:19 - Mom: what have u done to make u a sick person?
4/11/16, 19:19 - Cindy L: I want to apply financial aid
4/11/16, 19:20 - Cindy L: I dunno, stop doing all the good stuff and chug a lot of sugar
4/11/16, 19:20 - Cindy L: Dude sugar is like drugs.
4/11/16, 19:20 - Cindy L: It also ruins ur life.
4/11/16, 19:20 - Cindy L: Don't take drugs kids.
4/11/16, 19:20 - Mom: so stop sugar from now on
4/11/16, 19:20 - Cindy L: Ok
4/11/16, 19:22 - Cindy L: I think we did some great investigation work today
4/11/16, 19:23 - Cindy L: Oh right, I also read the offer letter. It's natural science
4/11/16, 19:24 - Mom: no particular restrictions?
4/11/16, 19:24 - Cindy L: No
4/11/16, 19:24 - Cindy L: It's unconditional
4/11/16, 19:24 - Mom: ofc la
4/11/16, 19:24 - Mom: u got ur ib results alreay
4/11/16, 19:25 - Mom: and u got to start at yr1, why still conditional?
4/11/16, 19:25 - Cindy L: Cuz it saysbu need to get 60% on ur first yr tests onbthe website
4/11/16, 19:26 - Mom: i think that's for ucl's own student asking for transfer to other faculty
4/11/16, 19:26 - Mom: not external student
4/11/16, 19:27 - Mom: but there's still an issue abt the streams selection???
4/11/16, 19:35 - Cindy L: Yea..,
4/12/16, 17:01 - Cindy L: So I took acetylcholine before bed
4/12/16, 17:01 - Mom: so?
4/12/16, 17:02 - Mom: don't tell u just woke up?
4/12/16, 17:03 - Cindy L: No
4/12/16, 17:03 - Cindy L: It was like I had ten red bulls
4/12/16, 17:03 - Mom: so sleep well?
4/12/16, 17:03 - Mom: what?
4/12/16, 17:03 - Cindy L: üòµ
4/12/16, 17:03 - Mom: so can't sleep?
4/12/16, 17:04 - Cindy L: Yea I didn't sleep very well, shouldn't hv taken it at night
4/12/16, 17:04 - Mom: that drug isn't for night sleep?
4/12/16, 17:04 - Cindy L: No
4/12/16, 17:05 - Cindy L: It isnt
4/12/16, 17:05 - Cindy L: Anyways
4/12/16, 17:05 - Mom: don't know it?
4/12/16, 17:05 - Cindy L: I took it again in the morning.
4/12/16, 17:06 - Cindy L: People take it before workout
4/12/16, 17:06 - Mom: acetycholine is for energy
4/12/16, 17:06 - Cindy L: Yea
4/12/16, 17:06 - Cindy L: So bad idea
4/12/16, 17:06 - Cindy L: But I forgot
4/12/16, 17:06 - Mom: come out, u shud take that theanine
4/12/16, 17:06 - Mom: before bed
4/12/16, 17:07 - Cindy L: Yea
4/12/16, 17:07 - Cindy L: I did as well
4/12/16, 17:07 - Mom: u took both before bed?
4/12/16, 17:07 - Mom: crazy
4/12/16, 17:07 - Cindy L: Cuz I didn't want to see hallucinations yesterday so I took both
4/12/16, 17:08 - Mom: pns and sns together
4/12/16, 17:08 - Mom: what's the result?
4/12/16, 17:08 - Cindy L: Er didn't sleep
4/12/16, 17:08 - Mom: zero, +ve or -ve?
4/12/16, 17:08 - Mom: for whole night?
4/12/16, 17:08 - Cindy L: Both of them r surprisingly effective on me.
4/12/16, 17:09 - Mom: how? sleep and not sleep?
4/12/16, 17:09 - Cindy L: No I mean I need to take theanine at night
4/12/16, 17:09 - Mom: i told u they're pns and sns
4/12/16, 17:09 - Cindy L: And acetycholine in the morning.
4/12/16, 17:09 - Mom: theanine is supplement?
4/12/16, 17:09 - Cindy L: Yes.
4/12/16, 17:09 - Cindy L: They r both just supplements
4/12/16, 17:10 - Mom: ok
4/12/16, 17:10 - Cindy L: But for some reason supplement very effective
4/12/16, 17:10 - Mom: so with acetycholine, u can work in daytime?
4/12/16, 17:10 - Cindy L: Acetylcholine is like
4/12/16, 17:10 - Cindy L: I take it today and I'm tired as shit.
4/12/16, 17:11 - Cindy L: But can't sleep
4/12/16, 17:11 - Mom: so, what did u do during the night time?
4/12/16, 17:12 - Cindy L: It's like shallow sleep
4/12/16, 17:12 - Cindy L: And I sleep with music
4/12/16, 17:12 - Mom: no weird dreams or nightmare?
4/12/16, 17:12 - Cindy L: So I kept changing the songs cuz I didn't like then.
4/12/16, 17:12 - Cindy L: Dude I barely slept, how can I dream
4/12/16, 17:13 - Cindy L: I slept in the morning
4/12/16, 17:13 - Mom: in fact, u didn't sleep and that's why ur so tired in the daytime
4/12/16, 17:13 - Cindy L: And that was like coma
4/12/16, 17:13 - Cindy L: Probably
4/12/16, 17:13 - Cindy L: But with rem sleep
4/12/16, 17:13 - Mom: so sleep until 5 in the afternoon?
4/12/16, 17:13 - Cindy L: As long as I nap I'm not tired
4/12/16, 17:13 - Cindy L: No I went to the library at 11
4/12/16, 17:14 - Cindy L: I took the acetylcholine this morning as well
4/12/16, 17:14 - Cindy L: And the naps were all useless.
4/12/16, 17:14 - Mom: tbh, sleep or nap in the daytime mostly involves rem sleep and couldn't be restful
4/12/16, 17:14 - Mom: so better to sleep at night time
4/12/16, 17:14 - Cindy L: Rem naps help me recover quickly
4/12/16, 17:15 - Cindy L: I'm not debating whether they r healthy or not
4/12/16, 17:15 - Mom: u shud took acetylcholine agian this morning cuz u have already messed up the sleep schedule
4/12/16, 17:15 - Cindy L: Acetylcholine seems to reduce rem
4/12/16, 17:15 - Mom: u shud wait until tmr or the day after
4/12/16, 17:16 - Cindy L: Stop interrupting my reporting
4/12/16, 17:16 - Mom: acetylcholine isn't anti-depressant, how can they reduce rem?
4/12/16, 17:16 - Cindy L: Er it's a neurotransmitter
4/12/16, 17:16 - Cindy L: Anti depressants aren't the only thing that reduces rem
4/12/16, 17:17 - Cindy L: That's like saying cows only eat grass.
4/12/16, 17:17 - Mom: but acetylcholine sure can't reduce rem
4/12/16, 17:18 - Cindy L: What is rem again? A lot of acetylcholine and almost none of the others.
4/12/16, 17:18 - Mom: okok, u check ur research again
4/12/16, 17:19 - Mom: go continue ur reporting
4/12/16, 17:19 - Cindy L: Dunno basically I feel like death today
4/12/16, 17:19 - Mom: the answer is bc u didn't even sleep last night
4/12/16, 17:20 - Cindy L: Yeah normally even if I don't sleep I don't feel like deatg
4/12/16, 17:20 - Cindy L: Death
4/12/16, 17:20 - Cindy L: I just nap more and maybe hv more episodes
4/12/16, 17:20 - Mom: rmb ur still suffering from sleep disorder
4/12/16, 17:20 - Mom: u can't compare with normal situation
4/12/16, 17:20 - Cindy L: It's like the acetylcholine sets my body back to normal mode
4/12/16, 17:21 - Mom: do u have episode today?
4/12/16, 17:21 - Cindy L: So it removes all teh coping mechanisms
4/12/16, 17:21 - Mom: what coping mechanisms?
4/12/16, 17:21 - Cindy L: Rem naps and seizures
4/12/16, 17:22 - Cindy L: Its the body's way of recovering sleep quickly
4/12/16, 17:22 - Mom: so other than tired as dead, ur quite normal today?
4/12/16, 17:22 - Cindy L: Maybe Ive been having low acetylcholine levels
4/12/16, 17:22 - Cindy L: Yea I'm saying I'm normal
4/12/16, 17:22 - Cindy L: Like a normal extremely tired person
4/12/16, 17:22 - Mom: good
4/12/16, 17:23 - Mom: good
4/12/16, 17:23 - Mom: ur srly extremely tired
4/12/16, 17:23 - Cindy L: Normally in this situation the tired person would need to drink ten cans of red bull
4/12/16, 17:23 - Mom: no, just sleep for 12hrs or more
4/12/16, 17:23 - Cindy L: Well yeah
4/12/16, 17:24 - Cindy L: Ok
4/12/16, 17:24 - Cindy L: But I've had sleepless nights and in the morning I'm still ok
4/12/16, 17:24 - Mom: wow, still can work?
4/12/16, 17:24 - Cindy L: Cuz rem naps are equivalent to red bull for me.
4/12/16, 17:25 - Cindy L: Dude I'm narco.
4/12/16, 17:25 - Cindy L: There must be a way for narco ppl to cope with so much lost sleep
4/12/16, 17:26 - Mom: rem sleep
4/12/16, 17:26 - Cindy L: Yea
4/12/16, 17:26 - Cindy L: The theanine is interesting too
4/12/16, 17:26 - Cindy L: If I take it in the morning
4/12/16, 17:26 - Mom: rem sleep can retrieve ur body in relatively short time
4/12/16, 17:26 - Cindy L: Basically I hv to live on the floor
4/12/16, 17:27 - Mom: and this is why narco goes into rem sleep so quickly
4/12/16, 17:27 - Cindy L: Yea
4/12/16, 17:27 - Mom: u always take those drugs in the wrong time
4/12/16, 17:27 - Cindy L: Lol no this was before when I first order it
4/12/16, 17:27 - Cindy L: I tried like 2 days
4/12/16, 17:28 - Cindy L: Very obvious effects as well
4/12/16, 17:28 - Cindy L: But anyways it works on gaba
4/12/16, 17:28 - Mom: strange, u don't even react to ritalin but is affected by those supplments?
4/12/16, 17:28 - Cindy L: Yea exactly.
4/12/16, 17:29 - Mom: an interesting point
4/12/16, 17:30 - Cindy L: U hv to take them properly though
4/12/16, 17:30 - Mom: ofc la
4/12/16, 17:30 - Cindy L: Like for the acetylcholine, I hv to take it with milk
4/12/16, 17:30 - Cindy L: Then it works very well
4/12/16, 17:30 - Mom: u can digest milk with bloating?
4/12/16, 17:30 - Cindy L: The first week I took it, I didn't do so, so I didn't really notice effects
4/12/16, 17:31 - Cindy L: Yah, I drink semi skimmed
4/12/16, 17:31 - Cindy L: It's ok
4/12/16, 17:31 - Cindy L: I just had like one gulp though
4/12/16, 17:31 - Mom: how do u learn that to take acetylcholine with milk?
4/12/16, 17:31 - Cindy L: Bodyweight forum
4/12/16, 17:31 - Cindy L: Those people take a lot of this shit
4/12/16, 17:32 - Mom: wow, incredible useful
4/12/16, 17:32 - Cindy L: Stimulant stacks
4/12/16, 17:32 - Mom: internet is so powerful
4/12/16, 17:32 - Cindy L: Yea
4/12/16, 17:32 - Cindy L: That's why data analysis seems pretty interesting to study as well
4/12/16, 17:32 - Mom: hahaha
4/12/16, 17:33 - Cindy L: Or like machine learning, not dumb stata crap.
4/12/16, 17:33 - Mom: data analysis is even boring than doing excel worksheet
4/12/16, 17:33 - Cindy L: OK I think I mean machine learning then
4/12/16, 17:33 - Mom: *more boring
4/12/16, 17:34 - Cindy L: No there was this talk where the doctor talked abt how u can analysis web searches to see what side effects people hv when they take certain drugs together.
4/12/16, 17:35 - Cindy L: Cuz this area of medicine is very difficult to study
4/12/16, 17:35 - Mom: yea, but it wud be too tiring to go online all the time and doing other medical stuff at the same time!!
4/12/16, 17:36 - Cindy L: Yea so u use a computer
4/12/16, 17:36 - Cindy L: Like a web crawler
4/12/16, 17:36 - Cindy L: And then look at the words which people search with names of drugs.
4/12/16, 17:37 - Cindy L: So good üëç
4/12/16, 17:37 - Cindy L: I wish someone would build a better sleep tracker
4/12/16, 17:37 - Mom: u do it law
4/12/16, 17:38 - Cindy L: Yea u see I need to know devs
4/12/16, 17:38 - Cindy L: Too late to learn
4/12/16, 17:39 - Mom: what subj to learn devs?
4/12/16, 17:40 - Cindy L: Comp sci
4/12/16, 17:40 - Cindy L: Those ppl started ages ago though
4/12/16, 17:40 - Cindy L: Like even before uni
4/12/16, 17:40 - Mom: since hs or ms?
4/12/16, 17:41 - Cindy L: I dunno, they do as hobby
4/12/16, 17:41 - Cindy L: I sort of did a bit
4/12/16, 17:41 - Cindy L: But not really went and learn the code
4/12/16, 17:41 - Cindy L: Ideally u want to be spending uni time building cool apps and stuff
4/12/16, 17:41 - Mom: u don't even know u want to learn this at ms/hs?
4/12/16, 17:42 - Cindy L: Not working out how to program the fibonacci sequence without stack overflow
4/12/16, 17:42 - Cindy L: Dude ppl in comp sci r like geeks
4/12/16, 17:42 - Cindy L: They r obsessed
4/12/16, 17:42 - Cindy L: U hv to be a geek
4/12/16, 17:43 - Mom: yea, they know what to do since 3 yrs old, but ur not that kind of person
4/12/16, 17:43 - Mom: how can u compare that with them?
4/12/16, 17:43 - Cindy L: It's ok
4/12/16, 17:43 - Cindy L: I just need to find a bunch of devs
4/12/16, 17:43 - Cindy L: I'll go into biotech
4/12/16, 17:43 - Cindy L: Team work bro
4/12/16, 17:44 - Cindy L: Steve jobs didn't know how to code either.
4/12/16, 17:44 - Cindy L: Tbh he was more of a very good marketeer
4/12/16, 17:44 - Mom: usually, ppl just embark on a road bc of some special events, not from inborn talent
4/12/16, 17:45 - Cindy L: Have u heard of theranos.
4/12/16, 17:46 - Mom: no
4/12/16, 17:46 - Cindy L: It's like cheap blood testing.
4/12/16, 17:47 - Cindy L: Abt time
4/12/16, 17:47 - Mom: i just google, they're under review by the regulators right now?
4/12/16, 17:47 - Cindy L: Oh yah
4/12/16, 17:48 - Cindy L: Us Doctors hate her basically.
4/12/16, 17:48 - Mom: http://www.cbsnews.com/news/theranos-ceo-elizabeth-holmes-company-under-review-federal-regulators-cms/
4/12/16, 17:48 - Mom: learn more first
4/12/16, 17:48 - Cindy L: Med industry has a lot of institutional rules.
4/12/16, 17:49 - Cindy L: Not as easy to do start up
4/12/16, 17:49 - Mom: this applies to all profitable industry
4/12/16, 17:49 - Cindy L: Google and fb worked cuz internet was news and less regulated
4/12/16, 17:49 - Mom: err..
4/12/16, 17:49 - Cindy L: Talk abt being in the right place at the right time.
4/12/16, 17:50 - Mom: don't just look at the +ve side, think abt the -ve as well
4/12/16, 17:50 - Cindy L: Of what Google and fb?
4/12/16, 17:50 - Mom: abt any start up
4/12/16, 17:50 - Cindy L: Oh yeah ofc

4/12/16, 17:53 - Mom: market is narrow?
4/12/16, 17:53 - Cindy L: But u need to choose something with cult followers
4/12/16, 17:53 - Mom: ü§îü§îü§î
4/12/16, 17:54 - Cindy L: And something which requires high specialization
4/12/16, 17:54 - Cindy L: Less competitor
4/12/16, 17:55 - Cindy L: Those r good stocks ‚úåüèª
4/12/16, 17:55 - Mom: üëç
4/12/16, 17:56 - Mom: go shower first, be brb

4/12/16, 19:26 - Cindy L: Shit I just napped
4/12/16, 19:26 - Cindy L: I thought I slept for two days
4/12/16, 19:32 - Mom: Dont take those supplements tonight la
4/12/16, 19:32 - Cindy L: I actually woke up once in bwtween
4/12/16, 19:33 - Cindy L: And thought it was the next day
4/12/16, 19:35 - Cindy L: So I've been snooping around
4/12/16, 19:36 - Cindy L: And apparently people who do sciences do double the work to what I'm doing right now.
4/12/16, 19:36 - Mom: What? Dream walking?
4/12/16, 19:36 - Cindy L: ?
4/12/16, 19:36 - Cindy L: What r u talking abt
4/12/16, 19:38 - Mom: U said u've slept twice?
4/12/16, 19:39 - Cindy L: I said it feels like I slept for two days straight
4/12/16, 19:40 - Mom: I thought u had sleep waking?
4/12/16, 19:41 - Mom: In between ur 2 days sleeps?
4/12/16, 19:42 - Cindy L: No

4/12/16, 19:43 - Cindy L: I read walking
4/12/16, 19:43 - Cindy L: Yes once
4/12/16, 19:43 - Cindy L: But who can predict when u wake up in nap
4/12/16, 19:44 - Mom: My bad, I'm half sleeping, I was in a dream b4
4/12/16, 19:44 - Cindy L: Sorry
4/12/16, 19:45 - Mom: I see now, I type the wrong words twice
4/12/16, 19:45 - Mom: Ttyl
4/13/16, 11:22 - Cindy L: Hi
4/13/16, 11:22 - Cindy L: Had acid reflux this morning
4/13/16, 11:28 - Mom: why? drug?
4/13/16, 11:52 - Cindy L: Dunno
4/13/16, 11:52 - Cindy L: Ibs
4/13/16, 11:57 - Mom: did u take any supplement last night?
4/13/16, 12:59 - Cindy L: No
4/13/16, 12:59 - Cindy L: Btw
4/13/16, 12:59 - Cindy L: U choose stream at the end of term 1
4/13/16, 13:00 - Mom: what? end of term 1?
4/13/16, 13:14 - Cindy L: Yea
4/13/16, 13:01 - Mom: but the website says u can't change stream by the end of the 2 week of term I starting?
4/13/16, 13:14 - Cindy L: No I looked at the handbook
4/13/16, 13:15 - Cindy L: Yr1 MT u just do three half units of foundation and half unit of math
4/13/16, 13:16 - Mom: rmb the whole point of transfering to ucl natural sci is for neurosci, if unable to do this, will u still do physics and maths for the remaining yrs?
4/13/16, 13:17 - Mom: so, this point must be certain
4/13/16, 13:17 - Cindy L: Yea
4/13/16, 13:17 - Cindy L: Will somehow clarify
4/13/16, 13:18 - Cindy L: It's for biomed.
4/13/16, 13:18 - Cindy L: Biomed.
4/13/16, 13:18 - Mom: yea, i mean this
4/13/16, 13:18 - Cindy L: Anyway they must hv open day
4/13/16, 13:19 - Cindy L: That sort of thing.
4/13/16, 13:19 - Cindy L: Lse just had it yesterday
4/13/16, 13:19 - Cindy L: They have so much more uni applying support if u study here.
4/13/16, 13:20 - Cindy L: Like last there was a halls tour so u can see all of them before u apply in hallpad
4/13/16, 13:20 - Cindy L: Last week
4/13/16, 13:20 - Mom: u mean ucl?
4/13/16, 13:20 - Cindy L: No lse
4/13/16, 13:20 - Cindy L: I saw them come
4/13/16, 13:21 - Mom: it's logical to do that for uk applications, but for international students like u, will u bother to go there for those thingy?
4/13/16, 13:22 - Cindy L: True
4/13/16, 13:22 - Cindy L: They already start looking at societies and freshers on fb tol though
4/13/16, 13:22 - Cindy L: Around this time last yr I was still worrying abt ib
4/13/16, 13:23 - Cindy L: Lolol
4/13/16, 13:23 - Mom: i think these uni open days also apply to american unis
4/13/16, 13:23 - Cindy L: Yea
4/13/16, 13:24 - Mom: did u sleep well last night?
4/13/16, 13:24 - Cindy L: Good
4/13/16, 13:24 - Cindy L: But I wake up
4/13/16, 13:24 - Cindy L: Hv first meal + supplement
4/13/16, 13:24 - Cindy L: And then now I'm tired again.
4/13/16, 13:25 - Cindy L: But no nap
4/13/16, 13:25 - Mom: tired but don't want to sleep?
4/13/16, 13:26 - Cindy L: Yea I lost my rem powers
4/13/16, 13:26 - Cindy L: I went to library yesterday, barely could read anything.
4/13/16, 13:27 - Mom: u mentioned that u took acetylcholine and theanine together the night b4 and then felt tired to dead yesterday?
4/13/16, 13:28 - Cindy L: Yes.
4/13/16, 13:29 - Cindy L: I don't think the theanine was that relevant yesterday cuz it just helps the brain relax
4/13/16, 13:29 - Cindy L: Which reduces hallucinations
4/13/16, 13:29 - Cindy L: Doesn't really affect sleep for mr
4/13/16, 13:29 - Cindy L: E
4/13/16, 13:31 - Mom: so what do u think that made u so tired? acetylcholine?
4/13/16, 13:31 - Cindy L: Probs
4/13/16, 13:31 - Mom: but acetylcholine normally gives u more energy
4/13/16, 13:31 - Cindy L: Right now I just feel like someone who hasn't slept for 10 years
4/13/16, 13:32 - Mom: again?
4/13/16, 13:32 - Cindy L: Yea
4/13/16, 13:32 - Mom: want to sleep for long time again?
4/13/16, 13:32 - Cindy L: No I cant
4/13/16, 13:32 - Mom: why?
4/13/16, 13:32 - Cindy L: I cant even take a nap
4/13/16, 13:33 - Mom: how long u feel tired after taking that acetycholine?
4/13/16, 13:33 - Cindy L: Acetylcholine seems to be working more like a stimulant.
4/13/16, 13:33 - Mom: yea
4/13/16, 13:33 - Mom: so, how come u feel tired?
4/13/16, 13:34 - Cindy L: Imagine someone pulls three all nighters in the row.
4/13/16, 13:34 - Cindy L: They need to do a fourth one so chug a lot of red bull
4/13/16, 13:34 - Mom: how long u've been cutting sugar?
4/13/16, 13:34 - Cindy L: So u get tired = but still awake to do work
4/13/16, 13:34 - Cindy L: Like a week
4/13/16, 13:35 - Mom: perhaps this is withdrawal effect of sugar on ur brain?
4/13/16, 13:35 - Cindy L: Hmmm
4/13/16, 13:36 - Mom: i read website that said withdrawal of sugar wud cause ppl brain fog and rlly tired initially
4/13/16, 13:36 - Cindy L: But I haven't completely cut it out. There is still sugar in carbs
4/13/16, 13:36 - Mom: but those effect will go away later
4/13/16, 13:36 - Cindy L: Like fruit
4/13/16, 13:36 - Cindy L: Those stuff
4/13/16, 13:37 - Mom: yea, u can't completely cut sugar, just added sugar
4/13/16, 13:37 - Mom: rmb that u've taken so much added sugar in ur food b4?
4/13/16, 13:37 - Cindy L: No sure if withdrawal happens if u consume less amounts
4/13/16, 13:38 - Mom: this def affects ur brain's perception abt the sugar level
4/13/16, 13:38 - Cindy L: If u cut it completely, yes
4/13/16, 13:38 - Mom: we can cut it completely right?
4/13/16, 13:38 - Mom: cutting all added sugar is still a big deal to the brain
4/13/16, 13:38 - Cindy L: Ok
4/13/16, 13:39 - Mom: perhaps listen to music to see whether it helps relieve ur tiredness?
4/13/16, 13:40 - Cindy L: No it doesn't
4/13/16, 13:40 - Cindy L: I always study with music
4/13/16, 13:40 - Cindy L: But yesterday it was just annoying.
4/13/16, 13:41 - Mom: today's same magnitude as yesterday?
4/13/16, 13:42 - Cindy L: I'll see
4/13/16, 13:42 - Cindy L: But music is good when I'm in anxious state.
4/13/16, 13:42 - Cindy L: That's abt it.
4/13/16, 13:42 - Mom: in fact, were u in same condition when ur at yr12?
4/13/16, 13:43 - Cindy L: In terms of what?
4/13/16, 13:43 - Mom: srly tired but can't sleep
4/13/16, 13:43 - Mom: bc of the deadline
4/13/16, 13:43 - Cindy L: Not exactly....
4/13/16, 13:43 - Cindy L: No
4/13/16, 13:43 - Mom: ok
4/13/16, 13:46 - Cindy L: That was ... Stressful
4/13/16, 13:46 - Cindy L: I get and adrenaline high when I meet deadlines
4/13/16, 13:46 - Cindy L: So that mostly supresses the tiredness
4/13/16, 21:37 - Cindy L: Napped in afternoon, round 1700 for an hr?
4/13/16, 21:37 - Cindy L: Then I forgot my key and locked myself out üòëüí¢
4/13/16, 23:32 - Mom: Omg
4/13/16, 23:33 - Mom: prob solved?
4/14/16, 02:39 - Cindy L: Yes
4/14/16, 02:39 - Cindy L: Also don't think I can drink milk after all
4/14/16, 02:39 - Cindy L: I get bloating
4/14/16, 02:39 - Cindy L: And the burps stink
4/14/16, 02:43 - Mom: üòü
4/14/16, 02:44 - Mom: how much u drink every time?
4/14/16, 02:45 - Mom: perhaps half the consumption or just sip little every time
4/14/16, 02:46 - Cindy L: Like a gulp
4/14/16, 02:48 - Cindy L: As in gluggglugglug
4/14/16, 02:48 - Cindy L: And then haaaai~
4/14/16, 02:49 - Mom: change ur drink method and quantity every time, maybe that helps digestion
4/14/16, 02:49 - Cindy L: I can hv max 2 tbsp
4/14/16, 02:50 - Cindy L: I use that much to swallow pill
4/14/16, 02:50 - Mom: btw 0250 still not awake?
4/14/16, 02:50 - Mom: not good for digestion
4/14/16, 02:50 - Cindy L: Yh I'm awake
4/14/16, 02:50 - Cindy L: Cuz bloating
4/14/16, 02:51 - Mom: what pill u took?
4/14/16, 02:51 - Cindy L: Acetylcholine
4/14/16, 02:51 - Cindy L: In the morning
4/14/16, 02:51 - Cindy L: Not now
4/14/16, 02:51 - Mom: shudn't u take it in the morning?
4/14/16, 02:51 - Mom: still bloating?
4/14/16, 02:52 - Cindy L: Yea I did
4/14/16, 02:52 - Mom: throughout the day?
4/14/16, 02:52 - Cindy L: No
4/14/16, 02:52 - Mom: no bloating in the morning? just now?
4/14/16, 02:53 - Mom: this shudn't be the milk prob
4/14/16, 02:54 - Cindy L: I didn't drink as much in the morning
4/14/16, 02:54 - Mom: what did u eat for dinner and what time?
4/14/16, 02:54 - Cindy L: Fried rice.
4/14/16, 02:55 - Cindy L: Egg fried rice good ah. Easy to make üëç
4/14/16, 02:56 - Mom: so, no milk ever drank in the night time?
4/14/16, 02:56 - Mom: and u said u had stomach pain, which might be cause by acid not milk?
4/14/16, 02:59 - Mom: do u have enzymes? it helps, if no, then u shud get it in the daytime for emergency purpose
4/14/16, 03:00 - Mom: also rub ur tummy, 2 inches below ur belly buttom, this helps eliminate those gas in ur intestines
4/14/16, 03:01 - Mom: or get some crackers which also helps eliminate gas in ur stomach
4/14/16, 15:22 - Mom: hi,
4/14/16, 15:23 - Mom: how ru today?
4/14/16, 15:46 - Cindy L: Better
4/14/16, 15:46 - Cindy L: I have booms and busts cycles.
4/14/16, 15:46 - Cindy L: Hahahaha
4/14/16, 15:47 - Cindy L: I have alternating days of productivity
4/14/16, 15:51 - Mom: weird
4/14/16, 17:04 - Cindy L: I'm trying to read and im falling asleep every now and then
4/14/16, 17:22 - Mom: can't read?
4/14/16, 17:22 - Mom: at all?
4/14/16, 17:23 - Cindy L: No suddenly I'm fine again.
4/14/16, 17:23 - Cindy L: I was listening to my sleep sound track
4/14/16, 17:23 - Mom: did u sleep/nap today?
4/14/16, 17:24 - Mom: sound track?
4/14/16, 17:24 - Cindy L: I switch to Swedish house
4/14/16, 17:24 - Mom: is there any sound during ur sleep?
4/14/16, 17:24 - Cindy L: Yea I hv a playlist for sleep
4/14/16, 17:24 - Mom: what is Swedish house?
4/14/16, 17:24 - Cindy L: Avicii
4/14/16, 17:25 - Cindy L: Martin garrix
4/14/16, 17:25 - Mom: those sound track is for ur sleep purpose?
4/14/16, 17:25 - Cindy L: No these r for studying.
4/14/16, 17:25 - Cindy L: Esp garrix
4/14/16, 17:25 - Cindy L: üëç
4/14/16, 17:26 - Mom: u made me confused
4/14/16, 17:26 - Cindy L: YouTube them and u will see what I'm talking abt
4/14/16, 17:26 - Mom: u said u were listening to ur sleep sound track
4/14/16, 17:26 - Cindy L: Yea when I first got here
4/14/16, 17:26 - Cindy L: And then I switched.
4/14/16, 17:26 - Mom: but then those sound track was used for studying?
4/14/16, 17:26 - Cindy L: No I have two playlists
4/14/16, 17:26 - Cindy L: I'm using Spotify
4/14/16, 17:27 - Mom: so u were listening to the sound track list for studying right?
4/14/16, 17:27 - Cindy L: Right now I am
4/14/16, 17:28 - Cindy L: Before I was listening to the sleep one.
4/14/16, 17:28 - Mom: so u sleep when listening to the sleep playlist right?
4/14/16, 17:28 - Cindy L: Yea
4/14/16, 17:28 - Cindy L: I also hv an exercise one
4/14/16, 17:29 - Mom: so what's ur prob?
4/14/16, 17:29 - Cindy L: Listened to the wrong playlist
4/14/16, 17:29 - Mom: u said u sleep now and then? disturbed by those playlist?
4/14/16, 17:29 - Mom: omg
4/14/16, 17:29 - Mom: be careful ma
4/14/16, 17:30 - Mom: and is it rlly powerful of the music that induces u to sleep/
4/14/16, 17:30 - Cindy L: Dunno
4/14/16, 17:30 - Cindy L: I usually nap around 1600
4/14/16, 17:30 - Cindy L: On acetylcholine as well
4/14/16, 17:30 - Cindy L: So it might be that
4/14/16, 17:30 - Cindy L: Cuz when I was in the coffee shop I was fine.
4/14/16, 17:31 - Mom: u normally won't sleep at coffee shop but wud fall asleep in lib or dorm?
4/14/16, 17:35 - Cindy L: Yah
4/14/16, 17:36 - Mom: weird???
4/14/16, 17:42 - Cindy L: ... Narco is weird
4/14/16, 17:43 - Mom: but my point is u don't have consistent symptoms at different places
4/14/16, 18:48 - Cindy L: Shrugs
4/14/16, 20:02 - Cindy L: There's such a communal studying atmosphere right now u can't not study
4/14/16, 20:02 - Cindy L: I bet it's probably like this all the time in imperial
4/14/16, 23:55 - Cindy L: My hr just suddenly slowed down again.
4/14/16, 23:55 - Cindy L: I was in the library
4/14/16, 23:57 - Cindy L: I've been thinking that maybe my brain is sending a signal for oxigenesis via the NV
4/14/16, 23:57 - Cindy L: Which means my body is going into momentary hibernation state.
4/15/16, 00:00 - Cindy L: I mean if u think abt it
4/15/16, 00:00 - Cindy L: My heart suddenly beats a lot slower
4/15/16, 00:00 - Cindy L: Focus shifts to storage
4/15/16, 00:01 - Cindy L: The muscles weaken and r paralyzed
4/15/16, 00:01 - Cindy L: I go to sleep
4/15/16, 00:01 - Cindy L: Sounds a lot like hibernation to me.
4/15/16, 00:01 - Cindy L: Do human even go into hibernation
4/15/16, 00:17 - Mom: how long did u hibernate then?
4/15/16, 00:41 - Cindy L: No I mean it's a possible explanation for slowing of hr
4/15/16, 00:42 - Cindy L: Not that I actually went into hibernation
4/15/16, 00:44 - Cindy L: Also I did some digging abt ucl natural sciences
4/15/16, 00:44 - Cindy L: Seems like u only choose the two streams at the end of first term
4/15/16, 00:45 - Cindy L: U do three intro courses and math in MT
4/15/16, 00:45 - Cindy L: And then go into stream in LT
4/15/16, 00:45 - Cindy L: And I saw that quite a lot of ppl r in my situation where they hv no a lvl chem.
4/15/16, 00:45 - Cindy L: üòÖ
4/15/16, 00:46 - Cindy L: Would definitely help if I had 4 credits from Berkeley
4/15/16, 00:46 - Cindy L: But ucl seems much more lenient and chill with everything than lse on the whole
4/15/16, 02:33 - Mom: ofc, human don't go into hibernation
4/15/16, 02:34 - Mom: and i just want to ask if u rlly had slept and how long?
4/15/16, 02:34 - Mom: abt the ucl's natural sci deg, i have read their website and the student room chats yesterday
4/15/16, 02:35 - Mom: they said if u want to enrol in life sci or biomed course, chem is a pre-requisite
4/15/16, 02:37 - Mom: tru that, many other offer holders not having a-level chem might also want to choose biomed/life sci subj, but do they have a-level bio?
4/15/16, 02:37 - Mom: u don't know?
4/15/16, 02:39 - Mom: why u want to do neurosci? u must be very clear abt ur goal in this situation, and get to figure out if u want to do neurosci in the biological aspect or chemical aspect?
4/15/16, 02:40 - Mom: lastly, what if ucl doesn't allow ur choice of chem + neurosci stream at the end of term 1?
4/15/16, 02:41 - Mom: u'll be put into a difficult situation - to do a physics + maths deg?
4/15/16, 02:42 - Mom: one more point, ur career choice after getting the neurosci training? lab researcher/ teaching/ or ???
4/15/16, 03:01 - Cindy L: I told u im doing biomedüòë
4/15/16, 03:02 - Cindy L: 2. Pharmaceuticals hire ppl if I'm not mistaken
4/15/16, 03:02 - Cindy L: Not to mention that everybody is pouring shit tons of money into cancer and neuro research
4/15/16, 03:03 - Cindy L: 3. Future tech development is headed this way
4/15/16, 03:03 - Cindy L: 4. Since 2008, finance industry hasn't been as good as before
4/15/16, 03:04 - Cindy L: Which means getting an econ degree is not as good comparable to a stem degree
4/15/16, 03:05 - Cindy L: 5. I know chem is prereq, that's why I'm doing the summer course üòë
4/15/16, 03:05 - Cindy L: 6. There is always the option of med school or MBBS as back up
4/15/16, 03:07 - Mom: i just remind u abt ur goal to ask for transfer, and in case u were not allowed to enrol in biomed courses, what next?
4/15/16, 03:08 - Mom: and ru 1/2 way of ur sleep process?
4/15/16, 03:08 - Mom: 0308 am? still doing whatsapp?
4/15/16, 09:33 - Cindy L: Yea I'm halfway through my sleep
4/15/16, 09:33 - Cindy L: I was
4/15/16, 09:34 - Cindy L: Ah ha
4/15/16, 08:09 - Mom: in fact, all my concerns above r just reminders to u
4/15/16, 09:34 - Cindy L: I wasn't finished
4/15/16, 08:10 - Mom: cuz i can see ur so anxious to escape from the lse prison
4/15/16, 08:11 - Mom: even though ur not intending to work in finance/ib area, it's not worth to trade off a good value deg with a pure science deg that doesn't serve ur initial purpose, right?
4/15/16, 09:36 - Cindy L: 7. In worse case scenario, I will hv one yr one of lib art from lse  and one yr of natural sci from ucl
4/15/16, 09:36 - Cindy L: Which makes me eligible to transfer to ucs
4/15/16, 09:36 - Cindy L: With some makeup
4/15/16, 09:37 - Cindy L: 8. Also I'm automatically registered for lse next yr, as long as I don't cancel that in advance.....
4/15/16, 09:38 - Cindy L: 9. I'm actually barely managing to read. And workload will increase next yr apparently
4/15/16, 09:39 - Cindy L: I dunno, there's always an uncertainty with my capabilities for me.
4/15/16, 09:42 - Cindy L: I'm not anxious to escape from lse prison
4/15/16, 09:43 - Cindy L: I spend half the time thinking of medical related stuff anyways.I don't need the extra stress
4/15/16, 09:44 - Mom: don't do one yr at lse and one yr in ucl, this is the worst scenario
4/15/16, 09:45 - Cindy L: Lol yea I was joking.
4/15/16, 09:46 - Cindy L: I'll probably do three years and do master at UCs or something.
4/15/16, 09:47 - Cindy L: Or there's always med schl
4/15/16, 09:47 - Mom: so it's critical if u can't do biomed at ucl
4/15/16, 09:47 - Mom: hahaha
4/15/16, 09:47 - Cindy L: In bad economic times, doctor seems like a safe option
4/15/16, 09:48 - Mom: u were just saying that u didn't have the energy to read, how come ur confident that u can read med skl, not joking serious issue
4/15/16, 09:48 - Mom: i'm not trying to push u into the finance market
4/15/16, 09:48 - Cindy L: Because that's just memorizing shit
4/15/16, 09:48 - Cindy L: What I'm doing now is reading a lot of info and having to analyse them.
4/15/16, 09:48 - Mom: but we must think of a safe way to do the biomed deg
4/15/16, 09:49 - Cindy L: I can make it through the reading.
4/15/16, 09:49 - Cindy L: Can barely make it though reading
4/15/16, 09:49 - Mom: cuz that's no good to switching between different courses many times
4/15/16, 09:50 - Cindy L: Like I said no. 8
4/15/16, 09:50 - Cindy L: Enrol in both unis for first term
4/15/16, 09:50 - Cindy L: Be an assholr
4/15/16, 09:51 - Mom: ur not in ucl's register now, don't have to panic
4/15/16, 09:51 - Cindy L: Yea I guess
4/15/16, 09:51 - Mom: how's ur sleep last night?
4/15/16, 09:51 - Cindy L: But if I firm I think I will be
4/15/16, 09:52 - Cindy L: Well obviously the best thing would be if NW offered me something
4/15/16, 09:52 - Cindy L: Hahahaha
4/15/16, 09:52 - Cindy L: üòî
4/15/16, 09:52 - Mom: even if u firm that choice, u still have to register probably at the start of the academic yr
4/15/16, 09:52 - Mom: don't panic, just wait
4/15/16, 09:52 - Cindy L: Yes, but if I don't go I need to tell them.
4/15/16, 09:52 - Mom: tell who? ucl
4/15/16, 09:53 - Cindy L: Yea if I firm
4/15/16, 09:53 - Cindy L: Tbh I got in surprisingly easily üòíüòí
4/15/16, 09:54 - Mom: if u firm ucas's choice, automatically register into ucl's registry?
4/15/16, 09:54 - Mom: i doubt?
4/15/16, 09:54 - Cindy L: No u need to register
4/15/16, 09:54 - Cindy L: But u still need to tell them.
4/15/16, 09:54 - Mom: don't worry la
4/15/16, 09:55 - Mom: just wait until start of the yr
4/15/16, 09:55 - Mom: be an asshole
4/15/16, 09:56 - Mom: i don't see why u can be accepted into ucl or imperial, cuz ur background is pretty strong, isn't it?
4/15/16, 09:56 - Cindy L: Not rlly
4/15/16, 09:56 - Mom: they just consider ur application as a high school student
4/15/16, 09:56 - Cindy L: Everyone who applies for science will be this strong.
4/15/16, 09:56 - Cindy L: U hv low expectations.
4/15/16, 09:57 - Mom: i rlly don't understand why imperial doesn't even offer interview
4/15/16, 09:57 - Cindy L: See imperial and ucl evaluation is so different
4/15/16, 09:57 - Cindy L: I think it's the gap yr
4/15/16, 09:57 - Mom: rmb that those applicants have only predicted grades?
4/15/16, 09:58 - Cindy L: Admissions offices don't like it when they don't know shit abt u
4/15/16, 09:58 - Mom: i think we shud fill in ur current lse yr in the ucas in the first place
4/15/16, 09:58 - Cindy L: The more they know abt ur history and record, I think the more likely they will choose u
4/15/16, 09:58 - Mom: and ucl is nice to ask for ur current uni enrollment details
4/15/16, 09:58 - Cindy L: So I think it was probably the weird gap in my profile.
4/15/16, 09:59 - Mom: maybe
4/15/16, 09:59 - Cindy L: I think that was because I asked abt transferring beforehand
4/15/16, 09:59 - Cindy L: So they were expecting my app
4/15/16, 09:59 - Mom: so this is a "lesson"
4/15/16, 10:00 - Cindy L: Don't hv black holes in ur CV
4/15/16, 10:00 - Cindy L: Everyone knows that.
4/15/16, 10:00 - Mom: what if somebody rlly take a gap yr for personal stuff?
4/15/16, 10:00 - Cindy L: Then u must write abt it
4/15/16, 10:01 - Cindy L: Even if unrelated.
4/15/16, 10:01 - Cindy L: Anyways I guess it's not that personal
4/15/16, 10:01 - Mom: so ms Beer is right? thb in the first place?
4/15/16, 10:02 - Cindy L: Huh depends on the timing and how necessary the info is.
4/15/16, 10:03 - Cindy L: No rational person would go around spewing their private matter without purpose.
4/15/16, 10:04 - Cindy L: So Ms. Beer wrong lah
4/15/16, 10:04 - Mom: exactly, so we can disclose only at critical time right?
4/15/16, 10:04 - Cindy L: Should be like letters, came in first lesson in a wheelchair
4/15/16, 10:05 - Cindy L: Didn't tell us why until end of the year
4/15/16, 10:05 - Cindy L: Poor guy, nerve problem as well
4/15/16, 10:05 - Mom: sigh.....
4/15/16, 10:05 - Mom: who can predict those things?
4/15/16, 10:06 - Cindy L: Yea he was paralysed all of a sudden as well
4/15/16, 10:06 - Cindy L: More like permanently paralyzed....
4/15/16, 10:07 - Mom: well, actually u can write this incident in ur application materials when asking for transfer right?
4/15/16, 10:07 - Mom: ofc not to mention exactly who he is
4/15/16, 10:07 - Cindy L: What application? What incident?
4/15/16, 10:07 - Mom: so that u don't have to disclose ur private prob in the first place
4/15/16, 10:07 - Mom: Letters case
4/15/16, 10:08 - Mom: in ur applications to us unis?
4/15/16, 10:08 - Cindy L: No why would I do that
4/15/16, 10:08 - Cindy L: U must be a horrible human being to take advantage of someone's tragedy like that
4/15/16, 10:09 - Mom: omg
4/15/16, 10:09 - Mom: ppl change their mind all in a sudden normally were induced by personal experience of something happened
4/15/16, 10:10 - Cindy L: I wouldn't want someone who barely knows me to write abt my case without asking.
4/15/16, 10:10 - Mom: ok, just forget that
4/15/16, 10:10 - Cindy L: Anyways it's much more effective to write abt ur personal case lah ofc.
4/15/16, 10:11 - Cindy L: U only borrow if u hv nothing interesting to tell
4/15/16, 10:11 - Mom: do u know why the dr who wrote "a stroke of insight" want to be a dr especially in neurology?
4/15/16, 10:11 - Cindy L: Cuz her BROTHER was schizophrenix
4/15/16, 10:11 - Cindy L: See relatives.
4/15/16, 10:12 - Cindy L: Not like distant aquaintances
4/15/16, 10:12 - Mom: she said in her book that her brother had been suffering from mental illness but she didn't, so she want to find out the reason
4/15/16, 10:12 - Cindy L: Yeah I know a lot of people in the world are suffering from mental illness too so I wanted to find out the reason
4/15/16, 10:13 - Cindy L: U see why she mentioned her motivation
4/15/16, 10:13 - Mom: no, i mean this is the triggering reason why u want to make a change of mind suddenly
4/15/16, 10:14 - Cindy L: Sure but I tell u if u wrote that it would go straight to the bin.
4/15/16, 10:14 - Cindy L: It's like quoting ghandi as opening sentnece
4/15/16, 10:14 - Mom: seeing those even unrelated persons suffering from serious illness is a reasonable reason for someone to take med skl
4/15/16, 10:15 - Cindy L: U need to at least be relative cuz it shows that u 'suffer' with the person as well
4/15/16, 10:15 - Mom: different, u don't have to quote those particularly GREAT persons for reference
4/15/16, 10:16 - Cindy L: Saying u saw an acquaintance have illness is like saying I saw a random person on the street with one leg.
4/15/16, 10:17 - Mom: Not agree what is ÂêåÊÉÖÂøÉ or ÂêåÁêÜÂøÉÔºü
4/15/16, 10:17 - Cindy L: Yea sure u can hv all the empathy in the world
4/15/16, 10:17 - Cindy L: But u need to hv convincing reason for other people to believe u have that
4/15/16, 10:17 - Mom: u know why ppl taking med skl have to do volunteer work in hospital?
4/15/16, 10:18 - Cindy L: Cuz they need to know what they r getting into
4/15/16, 10:18 - Cindy L: And to show that they can work with patients
4/15/16, 10:18 - Cindy L: It's not a test for empathy
4/15/16, 10:18 - Cindy L: They don't test doctors for empathy
4/15/16, 10:18 - Cindy L: Hahahaha
4/15/16, 10:18 - Mom: i honestly believe that those r rather good reason to make somebody to decide to pursue a career
4/15/16, 10:19 - Cindy L: What if everyone wrote that then
4/15/16, 10:19 - Cindy L: Then how would u discern who r actually empathetic
4/15/16, 10:19 - Mom: actually, most of med skl applicant wrote like that
4/15/16, 10:19 - Mom: i read some
4/15/16, 10:19 - Cindy L: Yea because this is the most basic way to show u hv empathy
4/15/16, 10:19 - Mom: even those for scholarship
4/15/16, 10:20 - Cindy L: Omg lemme apply for thosem
4/15/16, 10:20 - Mom: u know what makes difference? the reference

4/15/16, 10:21 - Cindy L: OK wat
4/15/16, 10:21 - Mom: ur dad when applying for charter engr

4/15/16, 10:22 - Mom: so, he has no particular prob passing the interview
4/15/16, 10:22 - Mom: someone don't, need more time to do the chartership
4/15/16, 10:22 - Mom: this is the reality
4/15/16, 10:22 - Cindy L: I've heard this story so many times.
4/15/16, 10:23 - Mom: so this is true
4/15/16, 10:23 - Cindy L: Don't stay in lse then, it's impossible to get a good reference
4/15/16, 10:23 - Cindy L: Tell u a better story
4/15/16, 10:24 - Cindy L: Someone from West island made it to CERN
4/15/16, 10:24 - Mom: ok
4/15/16, 10:24 - Cindy L: freaking cern
4/15/16, 10:24 - Cindy L: So esf does have actual smart peeps
4/15/16, 10:25 - Mom: the end?
4/15/16, 10:25 - Cindy L: Yeah the end
4/15/16, 10:25 - Mom: how do u his/her parents don't have connection with cern?
4/15/16, 10:25 - Cindy L: U can't it's a research facilityüòí
4/15/16, 10:25 - Mom: do u know the recent story of 689's daughter?
4/15/16, 10:26 - Cindy L: They just hire good people.
4/15/16, 10:26 - Mom: how can't/
4/15/16, 10:26 - Cindy L: No
4/15/16, 10:26 - Cindy L: Is she still here
4/15/16, 10:26 - Cindy L: Did she go into entertainment?
4/15/16, 10:26 - Cindy L: Didnt
4/15/16, 10:27 - Mom: do u know 689 made his son a seat in a very well-known swiss research team of the genetic research?
4/15/16, 10:28 - Cindy L: wow really how
4/15/16, 10:28 - Cindy L: Switzerland is like a haven for corrupt officials tbh
4/15/16, 10:28 - Mom: even though his son is smart, the prob is he made a connection of donation to that organisation
4/15/16, 10:28 - Cindy L: I see
4/15/16, 10:28 - Cindy L: Fair enough
4/15/16, 10:29 - Cindy L: At least that donation put to good use
4/15/16, 10:29 - Cindy L: Bye bye tax payer money
4/15/16, 10:29 - Cindy L: Better than foreign aid ah
4/15/16, 10:29 - Mom: he's just taking advantage of other ppl's money for his own good
4/15/16, 10:31 - Cindy L: No but u think abt it. U probably mentioning ETH Zurich
4/15/16, 10:31 - Cindy L: They produce a lot of good research
4/15/16, 10:31 - Mom: cant' rmb the name of that institute
4/15/16, 10:31 - Cindy L: Now u know at least more than 10% go to destination
4/15/16, 10:32 - Mom: hahaha
4/15/16, 10:32 - Cindy L: They research cancer and immune disease
4/15/16, 10:32 - Mom: probably not that one, cuz i rmb the institute concerned researches genetic problems
4/15/16, 10:33 - Cindy L: Cancer and immunity r genetic problems.
4/15/16, 10:33 - Cindy L: üòÖ
4/15/16, 10:33 - Mom: ÁëûÂ£´Âä†ÁæÖÁê≥Â≠∏Èô¢
4/15/16, 10:34 - Mom: something like that
4/15/16, 10:34 - Cindy L: If it's anything worthwhile it's ETH Zurich
4/15/16, 10:36 - Mom: oh, shud be this "Karolinska Institutet"
4/15/16, 10:37 - Cindy L: What matters is he made the donation to a very well known swiss genetics research team right
4/15/16, 10:37 - Cindy L: So no problem lah.
4/15/16, 10:37 - Cindy L: U just angry his son got a seat on the team in exchange
4/15/16, 10:38 - Mom: the prob is he made a donation out of other ppl's money for his son's personal advantage
4/15/16, 10:38 - Cindy L: But if u pull son out of the picture, he even done a good thing
4/15/16, 10:39 - Mom: no, what he's doing is for his son in the first place, he's not caring abt anything of the research
4/15/16, 10:39 - Cindy L: So who cares
4/15/16, 10:39 - Cindy L: What matters at the end of the day is where the money ends up
4/15/16, 10:39 - Cindy L: Everything else is abstraction
4/15/16, 10:39 - Mom: he made his plan the very first step just for his son's benefit not for the sci or society
4/15/16, 10:39 - Cindy L: Adam Smith lah
4/15/16, 10:40 - Cindy L: People motivated by personal greed
4/15/16, 10:40 - Cindy L: But somehow it all works out
4/15/16, 10:40 - Mom: so those not so greed persons or not greed persons have to suffer?
4/15/16, 10:41 - Cindy L: No there aren't any not so greedy people, just people incapable of acting on their greed cuz they hv no power to do so
4/15/16, 10:42 - Mom: power makes ppl corrupted right?
4/15/16, 10:42 - Mom: so sad
4/15/16, 10:42 - Cindy L: No people were already like that in the first place.
4/15/16, 10:42 - Mom: the god shud perish this world immediately
4/15/16, 10:42 - Cindy L: It's just that power allows them to do the things they want to do
4/15/16, 10:42 - Mom: or god shud commit suicide cuz he has made a corrupted world
4/15/16, 10:42 - Cindy L: Why
4/15/16, 10:43 - Cindy L: Nobody said men were created good.
4/15/16, 10:43 - Cindy L: And it's stupid to assume everyone is born equal as well
4/15/16, 10:43 - Mom: so sad
4/15/16, 10:44 - Cindy L: Ur rights r granted by the social situation u r born into
4/15/16, 10:44 - Mom: i don't worry u can't survive in china now
4/15/16, 10:44 - Cindy L: U sent me to lse.
4/15/16, 10:44 - Mom: u want to go to peking uni?
4/15/16, 10:45 - Mom: good cuz cheaper
4/15/16, 10:45 - Cindy L: People in sci are more positive
4/15/16, 10:46 - Cindy L: Optimistic peeps
4/15/16, 10:46 - Mom: maybe
4/15/16, 10:46 - Cindy L: It's not maybe
4/15/16, 10:46 - Cindy L: I'm claiming it as a fact
4/15/16, 10:46 - Mom: no, ppl in finance r most positive
4/15/16, 10:46 - Cindy L: Why
4/15/16, 10:47 - Mom: cuz they know the power of money and have very clear objective throughout their life
4/15/16, 10:47 - Cindy L: Exactly they know how he world works
4/15/16, 10:47 - Mom: ppl wud be happy if they have money to solve everything
4/15/16, 10:47 - Cindy L: They don't dwadle abt good bad and god
4/15/16, 10:47 - Mom: exactly
4/15/16, 10:47 - Mom: don't care abt good, evil or bad
4/15/16, 10:48 - Mom: just live a happy life
4/15/16, 10:48 - Mom: and scientist always have to bother for funding
4/15/16, 10:48 - Cindy L: Only poor people care abt God no offense cuz they have nothing and they hv grudge against those with power
4/15/16, 10:49 - Mom: wow, so novel hypothesis
4/15/16, 10:49 - Cindy L: No it's Nietzsche
4/15/16, 10:49 - Mom: i can say only helpless ppl care abt God
4/15/16, 10:50 - Cindy L: Morality and values ultimately comes from the self
4/15/16, 10:50 - Cindy L: Go sit under a tree for 99 days and think abt life.
4/15/16, 10:50 - Cindy L: Better than worship
4/15/16, 10:50 - Mom: lol
4/15/16, 10:51 - Mom: need to cook dinner, ttyl
4/15/16, 10:51 - Cindy L: That's how u escape from depression.
4/15/16, 11:09 - Mom: u mean i'm depressed/
4/15/16, 11:10 - Mom: wow, cook dinner is a way to escape from the reality/
4/15/16, 11:10 - Mom: üëç

4/15/16, 11:21 - Cindy L: I didn't really understand kitchen back then hahah
4/15/16, 11:21 - Cindy L: Or Keats poems
4/15/16, 11:22 - Cindy L: Really unfair to make kids analyse them when they don't even hv the life experience to do so
4/15/16, 11:28 - Mom: true that but u can analyze them in a kid's way right?
4/15/16, 11:29 - Mom: besides, u competitors were also kids
4/15/16, 11:29 - Mom: they've similar thoughts only
4/15/16, 11:30 - Mom: all u have to do is just listen to ur lecturer's analysis and rmb them and rewrite it in ur exam
4/15/16, 12:04 - Cindy L: Thays true
4/15/16, 12:05 - Cindy L: I couldn't find soda crackers for my acid reflux, do u think digestive biscuits will do the job?
4/15/16, 12:27 - Mom: yea, but digestive biscuits r too sweet

4/15/16, 21:12 - Cindy L: Surprise surprise, my stomach feels better after the chips.
4/15/16, 21:13 - Cindy L: Am I intolerant to fibre??
4/15/16, 22:19 - Cindy L: Just had a sandwich too, and then it became worse
4/15/16, 22:19 - Cindy L: Say they were vinegar chips
4/15/16, 22:20 - Cindy L: Possibly the pH balance in there is off or something
4/15/16, 23:39 - Mom: Impossible to be painful having sandwich?
4/15/16, 23:40 - Mom: What sandwich is that?
4/15/16, 23:41 - Mom: see Dr and get some stomach drugs
4/15/16, 23:41 - Mom: Or maybe ur just having Á•ûÁ∂ìÁóõ
4/15/16, 23:42 - Mom: That means ur too nervous sometimes??
4/15/16, 23:44 - Mom: How long u had this painful stomach?
4/16/16, 00:41 - Cindy L: It's like bloating and acid reflux
4/16/16, 00:41 - Cindy L: Ugh maybe I'm just a bit sick
4/16/16, 00:42 - Cindy L: I just got back from the lib at 9 and had super vivid dreams....
4/16/16, 00:42 - Cindy L: üòì
4/16/16, 00:47 - Cindy L: It's not nerve pain dw
4/16/16, 00:47 - Cindy L: That happens to my right eye instead
4/16/16, 00:48 - Cindy L: The chips were really effective though, the digestives were absolutely rubbish
4/16/16, 02:59 - Mom: i said salty biscuits
4/16/16, 03:00 - Mom: never heard or tried chips can relieve stomach pain??
4/16/16, 03:01 - Mom: for nerve pain, i mean the nerve at ur stomach aching which cause the stomach pain
4/16/16, 03:02 - Mom: btw, other than acid reflux feeling or stomach pain, any nausea or diarrhea or constipation???
4/16/16, 03:02 - Mom: since when u had this stomach pain?
4/16/16, 03:03 - Mom: not sure if ur having bloating bc of indigestion or too much acid???
4/16/16, 03:04 - Mom: any headache??
4/16/16, 07:07 - Cindy L: For some reason my memories r being increasing replaced by different ones whenever I wake up on acetylcholine that it's being to scare me.
4/16/16, 07:09 - Cindy L: Also I sort of hallucinated on waking this time üò∞
4/16/16, 07:11 - Mom: how ur memories being replaced by different ones?
4/16/16, 07:29 - Cindy L: I had a vivid dream on waking
4/16/16, 07:29 - Mom: is that ur waking hallucination?
4/16/16, 07:29 - Cindy L: Yah
4/16/16, 07:31 - Cindy L: Moment I woke up, I forced myself to recall the layout of the flat and everyone's rooms are to calm myself down
4/16/16, 07:31 - Cindy L: It took quite some time for me to even remember the layout
4/16/16, 07:32 - Mom: what's that in ur mind when ur trying to reall the layout?
4/16/16, 07:33 - Cindy L: Like I knew that there was a bathroom opposite my room, but in my brain everything looked different
4/16/16, 07:34 - Cindy L: And they weren't even holborn furnishings
4/16/16, 07:35 - Mom: can u draw pic that's in ur brain?
4/16/16, 07:35 - Cindy L: No cuz I'm a bad drawer
4/16/16, 07:36 - Cindy L: Just confused
4/16/16, 07:36 - Mom: nvm, so ur brain has different setting of ur dorm right? or total different thing?
4/16/16, 07:39 - Mom: did u take acetylcholine today or yesterday?
4/16/16, 07:39 - Mom: if not yet today, stop it
4/16/16, 07:40 - Mom: ur current situation is probably caused by increased acetylcholine in ur cns
4/16/16, 07:40 - Mom: get some more water and calm  down first
4/16/16, 07:57 - Mom: i just read from the internet that mushroom contains 5htp, which might cause hallucinations as well
4/16/16, 07:58 - Mom: rmb the day u had bad hallucinations abt the 5 ppl, u had mushroom for dinner???
4/16/16, 08:01 - Mom: hello, where have u been? sleep again?
4/16/16, 08:06 - Mom: can u show me which acetylcholine supplement u have taken?
4/16/16, 08:21 - Mom: Higher concentration of acetylcholine in the cerebral cortex has also been shown to increase attention span, focus, neuroplasticity and communication between the left and right hemispheres of your brain.
4/16/16, 08:22 - Mom: see this, it seems u have opposite effect on consumption of acetylcholine supplements???
4/16/16, 08:57 - Cindy L: Serotonin doesn't always cause hallucination
4/16/16, 08:57 - Cindy L: I sometimes take 5htp to sleep an nothing happens
4/16/16, 08:58 - Cindy L: But say OK the mushrooms were at fault
4/16/16, 08:58 - Cindy L: The difference is that I hv vivid dream/ hallucinations on falling asleep
4/16/16, 08:59 - Cindy L: I just had them on waking this morning
4/16/16, 09:00 - Cindy L: I'll take u a picture later
4/16/16, 09:00 - Mom: ru ok now?
4/16/16, 09:01 - Mom: still confused? or scared?
4/16/16, 09:01 - Mom: better stop those supplements first cuz u can't tell what happens in ur brain
4/16/16, 09:15 - Cindy L: OK I'ma taking l-carnite pills
4/16/16, 09:16 - Cindy L: But if I don't take them, I sleep
4/16/16, 09:29 - Mom: L-carnitine seems to make seizures more likely in people who have had seizures before. If you have had a seizure, do not use L-carnitine.
4/16/16, 09:29 - Mom: Under-active thyroid (hypothyroidism): Taking L-carnitine might make symptoms of hypothyroidism worse.
4/16/16, 11:44 - Mom: hi
4/16/16, 11:45 - Mom: ok now?
4/16/16, 13:35 - Cindy L: Hurr
4/16/16, 13:35 - Cindy L: I just feel asleep
4/16/16, 13:35 - Cindy L: Like really good sleep
4/16/16, 13:35 - Cindy L: I was drooling.
4/16/16, 13:35 - Mom: sleep until now?
4/16/16, 13:36 - Cindy L: No for 15 min
4/16/16, 13:36 - Cindy L: But I guess it must be rem
4/16/16, 13:36 - Mom: why u didn't reply to my Qs?
4/16/16, 13:37 - Cindy L: Huu I was cooking at 9

4/16/16, 13:38 - Mom: i don't if ur alright, bc u didn't even a bit
4/16/16, 13:38 - Cindy L: I find i hv a tendency to check if I'm dreaming if I find my self in weird situtaion
4/16/16, 13:39 - Mom: ur always in weird situation?
4/16/16, 13:39 - Cindy L: Like I just dreamt I was home
4/16/16, 13:39 - Mom: here in hk?
4/16/16, 13:39 - Cindy L: And then I was going out to hv kfc
4/16/16, 13:39 - Cindy L: Yea
4/16/16, 13:40 - Cindy L: And then I thought it didn't really make sense
4/16/16, 13:40 - Cindy L: So I try to wake up, but I couldn't
4/16/16, 13:40 - Cindy L: And then u said not everything has to be a dream you know
4/16/16, 13:41 - Cindy L: And then u know that scene in inception where do caprio and the girl r sitting in a cafe
4/16/16, 13:41 - Cindy L: And he asks her do u remember how u go there
4/16/16, 13:41 - Cindy L: So basically we went through that
4/16/16, 13:42 - Cindy L: I thought it was strange I didn't know how I suddenly went home.
4/16/16, 13:42 - Cindy L: And then dad appeared
4/16/16, 13:42 - Cindy L: And then we were all like yea u came back with him
4/16/16, 13:43 - Cindy L: So I was like oh
4/16/16, 13:43 - Mom: so, we all went to kfc?
4/16/16, 13:43 - Cindy L: I guess I don't remember after that
4/16/16, 13:44 - Cindy L: But I couldn't wake up
4/16/16, 13:44 - Mom: is this all u dream for the 15 mins sleep just b4?
4/16/16, 13:44 - Cindy L: Yea
4/16/16, 13:44 - Cindy L: I had two dreams in 15 mins
4/16/16, 13:44 - Mom: wow
4/16/16, 13:44 - Cindy L: The other one was abt looking for a Korean guy
4/16/16, 13:45 - Cindy L: But I don't really remember why so never mind.
4/16/16, 13:45 - Mom: sounds like the usual things we did here in hk
4/16/16, 13:45 - Cindy L: Yea but I knew it was a dream
4/16/16, 13:45 - Mom: watching korean drama, k music...
4/16/16, 13:46 - Cindy L: But I couldn't wake up
4/16/16, 13:46 - Cindy L: Scary thought
4/16/16, 13:46 - Mom: why scary?
4/16/16, 13:46 - Mom: ur dreams r not scary
4/16/16, 13:46 - Cindy L: What if this is a dream
4/16/16, 13:46 - Cindy L: My dreams r also getting better.
4/16/16, 13:47 - Cindy L: I could taste thing this morning.
4/16/16, 13:47 - Mom: in ur dream?
4/16/16, 13:47 - Cindy L: Yea
4/16/16, 13:47 - Mom: what is that?
4/16/16, 13:47 - Cindy L: I'm not gonna say, but it was a bad taste
4/16/16, 13:48 - Mom: u sure that's a dream?
4/16/16, 13:48 - Mom: u said u had a vivid dream this morning?
4/16/16, 13:48 - Cindy L: Yea
4/16/16, 13:48 - Cindy L: Yea super vivid
4/16/16, 13:48 - Mom: what's it abt?
4/16/16, 13:49 - Cindy L: Er...
4/16/16, 13:49 - Cindy L: Lemme think abt it
4/16/16, 13:50 - Cindy L: O
4/16/16, 13:50 - Cindy L: Oh
4/16/16, 13:50 - Cindy L: I had a horse chew on hand the other day when I laughed too much
4/16/16, 13:51 - Cindy L: My hand
4/16/16, 13:51 - Cindy L: Hahahaba
4/16/16, 13:52 - Mom: what's horse chew?
4/16/16, 13:52 - Cindy L: A horse which was munching on my hand
4/16/16, 13:53 - Cindy L: But no pain
4/16/16, 13:53 - Cindy L: Just my hand was stuck in the head of a horse
4/16/16, 13:53 - Mom: what?
4/16/16, 13:53 - Cindy L: Yah
4/16/16, 13:53 - Mom: is this hallucination or what?
4/16/16, 13:54 - Cindy L: I dunno I must hv paassed out from laughing.
4/16/16, 13:54 - Cindy L: Or post lunch
4/16/16, 13:54 - Mom: food again?
4/16/16, 13:54 - Cindy L: I think I had lunch
4/16/16, 13:55 - Cindy L: I can't remember
4/16/16, 13:55 - Cindy L: This was a few days ago
4/16/16, 13:55 - Mom: u had lunch, u thought
4/16/16, 13:55 - Cindy L: By lunch I mean breakfast
4/16/16, 13:55 - Mom: after lunch, u laughed and then fell asleep and had a horse chew?
4/16/16, 13:56 - Cindy L: I probably had breakfast, watched a couple of episodes, laughed until I fell asleep and saw the horse
4/16/16, 13:56 - Cindy L: Also I always see those things in the corner of my eye
4/16/16, 13:56 - Cindy L: Like I can't see them directly
4/16/16, 13:57 - Mom: those hallucinations thingy appeared only at the corner of ur eyes?
4/16/16, 14:00 - Cindy L: Ye
4/16/16, 14:00 - Cindy L: Like if i look to the side I see them
4/16/16, 14:00 - Cindy L: But given that when cataplexy happens, my eyes get droopy and I can't really see straight anyways.
4/16/16, 14:01 - Cindy L: But I can roll my eyes left and right for sure
4/16/16, 14:02 - Mom: i thought ur eyes rolled backwards uncontrollable?
4/16/16, 14:02 - Mom: no?
4/16/16, 14:08 - Cindy L: No then become droopy
4/16/16, 14:08 - Cindy L: They
4/16/16, 14:08 - Cindy L: I roll them up myself
4/16/16, 14:08 - Cindy L: Cuz it helps me control them
4/16/16, 14:08 - Mom: ic
4/16/16, 14:08 - Cindy L: But when they droop, it feels like they are rolling back
4/16/16, 14:09 - Cindy L: Anyways
4/16/16, 14:09 - Cindy L: Anothwe strange thing happened last night
4/16/16, 14:09 - Cindy L: Around 3 I'm guessing
4/16/16, 14:10 - Cindy L: Like I heard this Chinese couple really loudly outside the window
4/16/16, 14:10 - Mom: u heard them chatting?
4/16/16, 14:10 - Cindy L: They were speaking in canto I think in the beginning
4/16/16, 14:11 - Cindy L: The lady was very distressed
4/16/16, 14:11 - Cindy L: I thought they were tourists and that they were lost in the beginning
4/16/16, 14:11 - Cindy L: So all I am doing is just listening to these two people with my curtain and window slightly opened.
4/16/16, 14:12 - Cindy L: The lady was like very angry cuz she lost her kid.
4/16/16, 14:12 - Cindy L: And the guy kept tell her to calm down.
4/16/16, 14:13 - Cindy L: So I didn't think anything was strange abt that, because u always hear weird stuff from my room
4/16/16, 14:13 - Cindy L: Anyways and then the lady got very frustrated
4/16/16, 14:13 - Cindy L: So she started screaming at cars
4/16/16, 14:14 - Cindy L: And then man didn't do anything to stop her much
4/16/16, 14:15 - Cindy L: So at this point, they were quite noisy tourists
4/16/16, 14:16 - Mom: the end?
4/16/16, 14:16 - Cindy L: I was thinking that these two people r so annoying, why do they do this in the middle of the night
4/16/16, 14:16 - Cindy L: No
4/16/16, 14:17 - Cindy L: Just started man
4/16/16, 14:17 - Cindy L: I wanted to stick my head out and tell them to shut up
4/16/16, 14:18 - Cindy L: To my surprise that is exactly what I hear next, a couple of shut ups probably from people who live above in hh I thought
4/16/16, 14:18 - Cindy L: This made things even worse
4/16/16, 14:19 - Cindy L: The couple sudden start talking in mandarin
4/16/16, 14:19 - Cindy L: First strange thing.
4/16/16, 14:19 - Cindy L: And the woman was like bawling on the street cuz she couldn't find her kid
4/16/16, 14:20 - Cindy L: And then the man was getting very impatient and they were just yelling at each other in mandarin
4/16/16, 14:20 - Cindy L: I swear they were speaking in canto before
4/16/16, 14:20 - Cindy L: So I didn't get why they switch to mandarin
4/16/16, 14:21 - Cindy L: And then somehow batteries were mentioned in the conversation and my mind drift to thinking abt batteries instead
4/16/16, 14:21 - Cindy L: Main q is so the whole scenario was a dream?
4/16/16, 14:22 - Mom: so, that's the end of the couple?
4/16/16, 14:22 - Cindy L: Yea
4/16/16, 14:25 - Mom: well, logically thinking this is a dream
4/16/16, 14:25 - Mom: and did u wake up after that?
4/16/16, 14:33 - Mom: why ur side suddenly can't connected?
4/16/16, 14:48 - Cindy L: Maybe
4/16/16, 14:48 - Cindy L: I dont remember I just realise that xoud have been a dream
4/16/16, 15:02 - Mom: it seems that u had lots of weird dreams and "hallucination" in uk?  what makes this happen there in uk so frequent?
4/16/16, 15:40 - Mom: u still didn't tell me ur vivid dream??
4/16/16, 15:40 - Cindy L: Omg I just slept an had another vivid dream
4/16/16, 15:41 - Mom: omg, what happened ah????
4/16/16, 15:41 - Cindy L: It's like I take the acetylcholine and it temporary suppress them
4/16/16, 15:42 - Mom: acetylcholine isn't to suppress the rem sleep
4/16/16, 15:42 - Mom: it's the antidepressant that suppress rem sleep
4/16/16, 15:43 - Cindy L: i'm not talking about rem
4/16/16, 15:43 - Cindy L: i'm talking about dreams
4/16/16, 15:43 - Mom: acetylcholine theoretically helps in focus, alert and enhance ur memories
4/16/16, 15:44 - Mom: those r ur rem dreams
4/16/16, 15:45 - Cindy L: rem and dreaming is just corelation
4/16/16, 15:45 - Cindy L: corelation does not mean they are the same thing
4/16/16, 15:45 - Cindy L: it doesn't even mean there is a casual relationship
4/16/16, 15:45 - Mom: u make dreams during sleep, whether in rem sleep or nonrem sleep
4/16/16, 15:46 - Mom: when u dream in rem sleep, those r rem dreams
4/16/16, 15:46 - Cindy L: yo i don't know what is happening today
4/16/16, 15:46 - Mom: and u can make dream in nonrem sleep, those r nonrem dreams
4/16/16, 15:46 - Cindy L: i'm just reporting to the best of what i can describe with language
4/16/16, 15:46 - Mom: did u take any supplements or pill last night or this morning?
4/16/16, 15:47 - Cindy L: so i choose not to call them rem dreams today cuz that would be misleading adn confusing when i read back for future ref
4/16/16, 15:46 - Mom: it's probably the withdrawal effect
4/16/16, 15:47 - Cindy L: no
4/16/16, 15:47 - Cindy L: but i did for the last fibe days
4/16/16, 15:47 - Cindy L: five
4/16/16, 15:48 - Mom: okay, it's probably the withdrawal effect or the cumulative effects that run out today
4/16/16, 15:48 - Cindy L: no i think it might be more of a suppression effect.
4/16/16, 15:49 - Cindy L: that i didn't take it today and then everything goes bwaaah
4/16/16, 15:49 - Mom: anyway, stop all supplements first and see if same things happen again
4/16/16, 15:49 - Mom: probably
4/16/16, 15:49 - Mom: withdrawal of antidepressant will have rebounce of rem dream
4/16/16, 15:49 - Mom: and ur like this situation now
4/16/16, 15:50 - Mom: ru sure u took the acetylcholine???
4/16/16, 15:51 - Mom: exactly
4/16/16, 15:51 - Cindy L: Yea l l-carnite
4/16/16, 15:51 - Cindy L: It's not an antidepressant
4/16/16, 15:52 - Cindy L: Guess i m going to the lib after all
4/16/16, 15:55 - Mom: ur taking that for weigh loss?
4/16/16, 15:56 - Mom: better stay in ur room la
4/16/16, 15:56 - Cindy L: No I'm taking that to stay awake.
4/16/16, 15:57 - Cindy L: How else am I supposed to study
4/16/16, 15:57 - Mom: but that
4/16/16, 15:57 - Mom: but that's not for keeping u awake or alert?
4/16/16, 15:57 - Cindy L: increase energy
4/16/16, 15:58 - Mom: yea, that's for weigh loss primarily
4/16/16, 15:58 - Cindy L: those that keep u awake or alert directly mess with ur brain.
4/16/16, 15:58 - Cindy L: can't get my hands on them
4/16/16, 16:00 - Cindy L: read this
4/16/16, 16:00 - Cindy L: this is a trustable source:
4/16/16, 16:00 - Cindy L: http://umm.edu/health/medical/altmed/supplement/carnitine-lcarnitine
4/16/16, 15:59 - Mom: u had stomach pain/ acid reflux since taking acetylcholine???
4/16/16, 16:01 - Cindy L: hmmm
4/16/16, 16:01 - Cindy L: yeah possible
4/16/16, 16:01 - Cindy L: but also cuz i didn't eat much
4/16/16, 16:04 - Mom: it says it helps promote ur energy, but also says not suitable for ppl with hypothyroidism???
4/16/16, 16:05 - Mom: btw, hong long u took this? and did u take this together with other supplements for the past five days?
4/16/16, 16:05 - Mom: maybe drugs interaction effect???
4/16/16, 16:08 - Cindy L: Mopps
4/16/16, 16:08 - Mom: ye
4/16/16, 16:08 - Cindy L: U think I run a pharmacy here
4/16/16, 16:09 - Cindy L: I only hv these
4/16/16, 16:10 - Mom: okok
4/16/16, 16:11 - Mom: just to try to find out if ur having drugs interaction effect!!!
4/16/16, 16:18 - Cindy L: Things we know:
4/16/16, 16:19 - Cindy L: 1. I had a shit ton of vivid dreams today
4/16/16, 16:19 - Cindy L: 2. I had a bad stomach last night
4/16/16, 16:19 - Cindy L: 3. I had been taking l-carnite for the past five days but not today
4/16/16, 16:21 - Cindy L: L carnitine
4/16/16, 16:22 - Mom: ur today's situation probably r the withdrawal effect of something which i don't know???
4/16/16, 16:23 - Mom: and ur stomache is also the prob?
4/16/16, 16:23 - Mom: causing ur brain nerve so sensitive
4/16/16, 16:24 - Mom: but it's weird that ur stomach pain was relieved by vingear chips
4/16/16, 16:24 - Mom: this is not logical
4/16/16, 16:39 - Cindy L: Yea
4/16/16, 16:39 - Cindy L: Maybe the lack of carbs?
4/16/16, 17:35 - Mom: let me clarify: u took acetylcholine + L-carnitine for the past five days?
4/16/16, 17:45 - Cindy L: no just l-carnitine
4/16/16, 17:46 - Mom: how many days of acetylcholine supplements u took?
4/16/16, 17:48 - Mom: but i rmb that a few before, u took acetylcholine + theanine bc u had a bad hallucination that night and r so scary?
4/16/16, 17:48 - Mom: and thereafter, u told me u have took acetylcholine in the morning and took theanine before sleep?
4/16/16, 18:15 - Cindy L: five days of acetylcholine in the morning.
4/16/16, 18:15 - Cindy L: only once with the l-theanine cuz i didn't find it necessary
4/16/16, 18:18 - Mom: U took 5 days of acetylcholine, then u had severe stomach pain + acid reflux and start to hv bad hallucination? Rite?
4/16/16, 19:09 - Cindy L: No the stomach pain was already happening by day two
4/16/16, 19:12 - Mom: I just check that ur bloating might probably cuz by l-carnitine
4/16/16, 19:14 - Cindy L: Kk
4/16/16, 21:40 - Cindy L: 21xx : had episode of rapid activity of nerve signals.
4/17/16, 00:15 - Cindy L: <Media omitted>
4/17/16, 00:16 - Cindy L: Found a very good description of what happens during the "episodes" I get from time to time.
4/17/16, 00:17 - Cindy L: The shaking feeling is the 'bursts of clonic muscular activity' which makes it feel like a seizure
4/17/16, 00:30 - Cindy L: <Media omitted>
4/17/16, 00:31 - Cindy L: See near the end, cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain are one of the main areas responsible for wakefulness
4/17/16, 01:00 - Mom: what is ur rapid nerve activity?
4/17/16, 01:00 - Mom: electric impulse feeling?
4/17/16, 01:01 - Mom: and the description mentioned in that studies is for what? cataplexy?
4/17/16, 01:08 - Cindy L: That thing
4/17/16, 01:08 - Cindy L: Read the first description
4/17/16, 01:09 - Cindy L: That is what I've been trying to describe for so long.
4/17/16, 01:09 - Cindy L: Not cataplexy
4/17/16, 01:10 - Mom: u said ur experiencing that thing last night at 21xx?
4/17/16, 01:10 - Cindy L: I can't really remember ....
4/17/16, 01:11 - Cindy L: But basically it's that thinf
4/17/16, 01:11 - Cindy L: Thinf
4/17/16, 01:11 - Cindy L: Thing
4/17/16, 01:11 - Cindy L: Seizure, rapid nerve avticity, episode, shaking --> all referring to that
4/17/16, 01:12 - Cindy L: Which I guess is rem
4/17/16, 01:12 - Cindy L: So my first estimate that those r rem episodes was right
4/17/16, 01:12 - Mom: yea, i know, but u got that episode last night right?
4/17/16, 01:13 - Cindy L: U mean on 2100 on sat
4/17/16, 01:13 - Cindy L: Yea
4/17/16, 01:13 - Mom: also without triggering event? just had those episode?
4/17/16, 01:14 - Cindy L: No particular trigger
4/17/16, 01:14 - Mom: and what is that studies for?
4/17/16, 01:15 - Mom: what time u had ur dinner?
4/17/16, 01:15 - Cindy L: Understanding rem sleep: clues from brain lesion studies
4/17/16, 01:16 - Cindy L: Like ten
4/17/16, 01:16 - Mom: had dinner after the 21xx episode?
4/17/16, 01:16 - Cindy L: Yea
4/17/16, 01:17 - Cindy L: So this happened before dinner
4/17/16, 01:17 - Mom: this is not good eating habit
4/17/16, 01:17 - Cindy L: What choice do I hv
4/17/16, 01:17 - Cindy L: Her parents were here again.
4/17/16, 01:17 - Mom: rlly bad for ur stomach
4/17/16, 01:18 - Mom: can u just do ur cooking at the same time/
4/17/16, 01:18 - Cindy L: Why cant they eat outside seriously.
4/17/16, 01:18 - Cindy L: No our kitchen iabsuper cramped
4/17/16, 01:18 - Mom: they're so selfish
4/17/16, 01:19 - Cindy L: What do u think anyways
4/17/16, 01:19 - Mom: what?
4/17/16, 01:19 - Mom: abt what?
4/17/16, 01:19 - Mom: is there any treatment proposed at the end of that studies?
4/17/16, 01:20 - Cindy L: No it's based on lobotomized cats.
4/17/16, 01:21 - Mom: so, that just described the event happening and the rationale behind?
4/17/16, 01:21 - Cindy L: Yea report and theory
4/17/16, 01:23 - Cindy L: I thought abt where peristalsis could be a trigger instead of foos
4/17/16, 01:23 - Mom: it said it's the cholingeric neurons at the basal forebrain responsible for the wakefulness? so it's ur level of acetylcholine or ... having prob?
4/17/16, 01:24 - Cindy L: Calm down, they only say those neuros play a role
4/17/16, 01:25 - Mom: but u said u had that episode b4 eating? theoretically digestion of food b4 had already completed and no more peristalsis happened?
4/17/16, 01:26 - Cindy L: U realize digestion fakes a very looong time
4/17/16, 01:26 - Mom: abt 2 hrs
4/17/16, 01:26 - Mom: right?
4/17/16, 01:26 - Cindy L: I dunno
4/17/16, 01:28 - Mom: b4 dinner, did u eat or drink anything?
4/17/16, 01:40 - Mom: so vagus nerve is the most possible channel to transmit the stimulus to the brain and trigger rem sleep???
4/17/16, 01:59 - Cindy L: Yea the cheese twists
4/17/16, 01:59 - Cindy L: I know abt the vagus nerve
4/17/16, 02:00 - Cindy L: What abt it?
4/17/16, 02:32 - Mom: wait a minute, will narcos have similar episodes other than sudden sleep attacks and/or cataplexy?
4/17/16, 02:35 - Cindy L: I dunno it's not on the official list of symptoms, but from the looks of it, these r sudden rem episodes which sort of count as sleep attacks I guess
4/17/16, 02:36 - Cindy L: Except u dont literally fall asleep on the spot but kind of experience daytime sleep paralysis
4/17/16, 02:37 - Cindy L: Which is why I called them daytime sleep paralysis in the beginning, but u didn't really understand and I wasn't very good at describing all of that.
4/17/16, 02:40 - Mom: what i want to mention is that: for narcos, they r deficiency in orexin which cuz the sleep attacks?
4/17/16, 02:40 - Mom: and for ur episodes, r they cuz by orexin or other nerve prob?
4/17/16, 02:41 - Cindy L: Yea u see in the passage I sent u that it mentions orexin neurons as one of the wakefulness regulating mechanisms.
4/17/16, 02:41 - Mom: if u don't rlly eat, will ur symptoms decreased?
4/17/16, 02:42 - Cindy L: So in narcos, it's the orexin system gone wrong.
4/17/16, 02:42 - Cindy L: What I think has happened in my case is that
4/17/16, 02:43 - Cindy L: 1. Chronic inflammation in the gut somehow causes the NV to be inflammed now and then
4/17/16, 02:44 - Cindy L: 2. Since the top end of the NV is directly linked to the hypothalamus, it ended up affecting neurons up there as well
4/17/16, 02:44 - Cindy L: 3. Possibly my orexin neurons are affected I don't know
4/17/16, 02:45 - Cindy L: if cataplexy is directly related to orexin then it's probably my orexin mechanism gone awry
4/17/16, 02:46 - Cindy L: Or else it might be some other set of neurons in the basal ganglia which involves cholinergic mechanisms instead which could explain why when I take l-carnitine supplements they r so effective
4/17/16, 02:47 - Cindy L: Also I just went to the toilet
4/17/16, 02:47 - Cindy L: My poo is so dry I may have to pull it out myself.
4/17/16, 02:48 - Cindy L: Cuttinf carb and Increasing fibre consumption seems to be making things worse.
4/17/16, 02:48 - Cindy L: When I only had soba noodles and crab sticks it was not this bad
4/17/16, 02:49 - Mom: no, bc u had comsumed l-carnitine for the week b4, that is presumed to retent water in ur body
4/17/16, 02:51 - Cindy L: I see
4/17/16, 02:52 - Cindy L: Might be that, then I stop the l-carnitine for a week and see
4/17/16, 02:52 - Mom: rmb that the vagus nerve only transmit ur signals from lower part of ur body to the brain, not to spread virus or anything to the top???
4/17/16, 02:52 - Cindy L: The vagus nerve is connects the brain to the stomach
4/17/16, 02:52 - Mom: i know
4/17/16, 02:53 - Cindy L: If it's inflammed its like a rope on fire
4/17/16, 02:53 - Mom: u said taking l-carnitine is effective, in what way?
4/17/16, 02:53 - Cindy L: The fire will spread both ways
4/17/16, 02:53 - Mom: keep u alert? or awake?
4/17/16, 02:53 - Cindy L: Effective in improving wakefulness
4/17/16, 02:53 - Mom: yea, but that's the nerve impulse, ie. electrical signals??
4/17/16, 02:54 - Cindy L: Wait what r u talking abt?
4/17/16, 02:54 - Cindy L: The nv?
4/17/16, 02:54 - Mom: yea
4/17/16, 02:54 - Cindy L: Inflammation is not a signal
4/17/16, 02:55 - Cindy L: It's a state.
4/17/16, 02:55 - Cindy L: If the nerve is inflammed it can spread to top and bottom no matter which way the impulses r transmitted
4/17/16, 02:55 - Mom: yea, but ur nv is for transmitting signals
4/17/16, 02:55 - Cindy L: OK... Wait I don't really understand ur point.
4/17/16, 02:56 - Mom: ur muscles/membranes that's inflammed, not nerve???
4/17/16, 02:57 - Cindy L: Hmmm
4/17/16, 02:58 - Mom: unless the myelin sheath inflammed??
4/17/16, 02:58 - Cindy L: Nerves can be inflammed but I guess u have a point cuz if it was it would be much more obvious
4/17/16, 02:58 - Mom: exactly
4/17/16, 02:59 - Cindy L: So the problem here is how to connect gut problem to missing neurons.
4/17/16, 02:59 - Mom: ????
4/17/16, 02:59 - Cindy L: Another interesting thing I saw
4/17/16, 02:59 - Cindy L: The said rem was a reflex
4/17/16, 03:00 - Mom: why u said it's a reflex??
4/17/16, 03:00 - Cindy L: The paper said it's a reflex
4/17/16, 03:00 - Mom: if it's a reflex, the it shud be ANS prob
4/17/16, 03:01 - Cindy L: They mentioned that when they were feeding the cats with a tube they could induce rem sleep
4/17/16, 03:02 - Mom: oh, def digestion
4/17/16, 03:02 - Cindy L: Another study also mentioned that again u can induce rem in dogs during feeding
4/17/16, 03:02 - Mom: sorry, what deficiency r those cats and dogs have?
4/17/16, 03:02 - Mom: orexin or lesion of brain tissue?
4/17/16, 03:03 - Cindy L: They are decerebrate
4/17/16, 03:03 - Cindy L: As in their brains have been disconnected from the prefrontal cortex
4/17/16, 03:03 - Cindy L: Sorry the forebrain
4/17/16, 03:04 - Cindy L: Cuz we know that nrem is controlled in the forebrain
4/17/16, 03:04 - Mom: sorry, which part disconnected from the forebrain? pons? brain stem?
4/17/16, 03:05 - Cindy L: The brain stem is disconnected from the forebrain
4/17/16, 03:05 - Mom: then the main point shud be the connection??
4/17/16, 03:05 - Mom: not the orexin???
4/17/16, 03:06 - Cindy L: What sorry how ddo u reach that conclusion?
4/17/16, 03:08 - Mom: when ur in rem, ur forebrain control ur sleep states but it's ur neurons in brain stem, specifically the pons, that regulates ur motors activity
4/17/16, 03:08 - Cindy L: No u mistaken.
4/17/16, 03:09 - Cindy L: They cut off the forebrain to test if the cats could still rem
4/17/16, 03:09 - Cindy L: And they can
4/17/16, 03:09 - Mom: so, when ur paralysis, doesn't it mean the signal can't be put through to the pons
4/17/16, 03:09 - Cindy L: Which suggests that rem control is in the brain stem
4/17/16, 03:09 - Mom: u mean, removal of forebrain??
4/17/16, 03:10 - Cindy L: Yes like surgically
4/17/16, 03:12 - Mom: why remove forebrain?
4/17/16, 03:12 - Cindy L: To experiment?
4/17/16, 03:13 - Cindy L: They purposely altered the brains of cats to study rem phenomena
4/17/16, 03:13 - Cindy L: Cruel but true
4/17/16, 03:13 - Mom: what yr is that studies?
4/17/16, 03:14 - Cindy L: Dunno will have to pull out the book to see
4/17/16, 03:14 - Cindy L: But most of them r quite modern research
4/17/16, 03:14 - Mom: nvm, i chk already
4/17/16, 03:16 - Mom: so those studies demonstrate that sleep cycle is regulated at brain stem, right?
4/17/16, 03:16 - Cindy L: Yea
4/17/16, 03:18 - Mom: another Q: will rem sleep be induced if no feeding at all?
4/17/16, 03:20 - Mom: further Q: will modes of feeding affect the appearance of rem sleep?
4/17/16, 03:21 - Mom: further further Q: if lack/deficiency of orexin, will feeding still affect the rem??
4/17/16, 03:22 - Mom: sorry, u better take a rest first, and leave those Qs until tmr
4/17/16, 12:30 - Mom: hello
4/17/16, 15:05 - Cindy L: Hi
4/17/16, 15:05 - Mom: just woke up?
4/17/16, 15:05 - Cindy L: No just finished lunch
4/17/16, 15:06 - Cindy L: Omg it took two hrs.
4/17/16, 15:06 - Mom: 2 hrs? what? to finish lunch?
4/17/16, 15:41 - Cindy L: Lunch cooking and eating
4/17/16, 15:41 - Cindy L: Now i m reading econ but I hv to nap cuz I'm tired.
4/17/16, 16:18 - Cindy L: Yea without the l l-carnitine
4/17/16, 16:18 - Cindy L: I drift off to sleep a lot.
4/17/16, 16:19 - Cindy L: So now basically I read very fast cuz I don't know where I might get stuck and start napping
4/17/16, 16:20 - Mom: wake up la
4/17/16, 16:21 - Mom: what abt the choline?
4/17/16, 16:21 - Mom: is that helpful?
4/17/16, 16:25 - Cindy L: What choline
4/17/16, 16:26 - Cindy L: No l l-carnitine, no nothing.
4/17/16, 16:26 - Mom: acetylcholine precursor
4/17/16, 16:26 - Cindy L: L-carnitine is also a precursor
4/17/16, 16:27 - Mom: in fact, what acetylcholine did u take?
4/17/16, 16:27 - Mom: just l-carnitine only, no acetylcholine supplements?
4/17/16, 16:27 - Cindy L: Yah
4/17/16, 16:27 - Mom: ic
4/17/16, 16:27 - Cindy L: Cuz it had record of being effective
4/17/16, 16:28 - Mom: u can try acetyl-L-carnitine
4/17/16, 16:28 - Mom: another form of l-carnitine
4/17/16, 16:29 - Cindy L: Kk
4/17/16, 16:29 - Mom: Acetyl L-Carnitine
4/17/16, 16:29 - Cindy L: There's a couple
4/17/16, 16:29 - Cindy L: Which I know of.
4/17/16, 16:31 - Mom: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8187841
4/17/16, 16:32 - Mom: u story ended?
4/17/16, 16:34 - Mom: http://nootriment.com/acetyl-l-carnitine/
4/17/16, 16:35 - Cindy L: Yea cuz I need to read these chapters
4/17/16, 16:35 - Cindy L: I'll order a couple and try them later
4/17/16, 16:35 - Mom: kk
4/17/16, 16:36 - Mom: l-carnitine and choline r different thing
4/17/16, 16:36 - Cindy L: Yea but they r precursors
4/17/16, 16:36 - Mom: well, not rlly?
4/17/16, 16:37 - Mom: they act on different organs? systems?
4/17/16, 16:37 - Mom: nvm, get a bottle of acetyl-L-carnitine and try it?
4/17/16, 16:37 - Cindy L: K
4/17/16, 16:38 - Cindy L: But it will be similar to l-carnitine right
4/17/16, 16:38 - Cindy L: Which means it will mess up my stomach
4/17/16, 16:38 - Cindy L: And increase cases where my hr drops.
4/17/16, 16:39 - Mom: actually, the l-carnitine helps in cardiovascular prob, don't understand why u have reverse result??
4/17/16, 16:40 - Mom: it seems all those med/supplements u took had opposite result on ur body?
4/17/16, 16:40 - Mom: weird???
4/17/16, 16:41 - Cindy L: Ikr
4/17/16, 16:41 - Cindy L: Like ritalin makes me sleepy
4/17/16, 16:42 - Cindy L: Fibre makes me constipated
4/17/16, 16:42 - Mom: ????
4/17/16, 16:43 - Mom: when u eat fibre diet, u shud drink more water
4/17/16, 16:45 - Mom: ru going to tell me ur story abt that couple?
4/17/16, 16:53 - Cindy L: What couple
4/17/16, 16:53 - Cindy L: By couple I meant a few
4/17/16, 16:54 - Mom: the one u said at 1629???
4/17/16, 16:54 - Cindy L: See above
4/17/16, 16:54 - Mom: see ur writing above at 1629
4/17/16, 16:54 - Cindy L: By couple I meant a few
4/17/16, 16:55 - Mom: at 1629, u seemed to tell a story abt that couple u knew of
4/17/16, 16:55 - Mom: but then stop after 2 lines???
4/17/16, 17:04 - Cindy L: Yeah when I said a couple I mean a few
4/17/16, 17:04 - Cindy L: I know a few acetylcholine precursors
4/17/16, 17:04 - Mom: iiiiicccc
4/17/16, 17:04 - Mom: what u mean now
4/17/16, 17:05 - Mom: i thought u were trying to tell a story abt a couple, hubby and wife
4/17/16, 17:05 - Mom: omg
4/17/16, 17:05 - Cindy L: I know
4/17/16, 17:06 - Cindy L: Well I don't know any interesting stories abt couples
4/17/16, 17:06 - Cindy L: Just annoying ones who won't shut the fuck up in the library
4/17/16, 17:06 - Mom: okok
4/17/16, 17:07 - Mom: wear ear plug
4/17/16, 17:07 - Cindy L: I do
4/17/16, 17:07 - Mom: listen to music
4/17/16, 17:07 - Cindy L: I do
4/17/16, 17:07 - Mom: or complain
4/17/16, 17:07 - Cindy L: I don't mind if they talk abt interesting stuff
4/17/16, 17:07 - Mom: shu shu them
4/17/16, 17:08 - Cindy L: But ppl in the library are serious the dumbest ppl ever
4/17/16, 17:08 - Mom: so u shud stay in ur room
4/17/16, 17:08 - Cindy L: When I sit in the coffee shop, people around hv much more interesting conversations
4/17/16, 17:09 - Mom: how can u do ur revision if ur listening to other ppl's stuff in the same time??
4/17/16, 17:09 - Cindy L: It's not like I choose to listen
4/17/16, 17:09 - Cindy L: They just talk there
4/17/16, 17:10 - Cindy L: Abt random shit like dinner
4/17/16, 17:10 - Cindy L: Or gossip
4/17/16, 17:14 - Cindy L: Let me give u a picture of our library
4/17/16, 17:14 - Cindy L: Essentially like an office there, people go there to study or print things.
4/17/16, 17:15 - Mom: what's the prob then?
4/17/16, 17:15 - Cindy L: Math people all reside on the top floor for some reason, so it is nice and quiet
4/17/16, 17:15 - Cindy L: Unfortunately also extremely hot
4/17/16, 17:16 - Cindy L: Because somebody decided to design the whole library in a tube
4/17/16, 17:16 - Cindy L: Which means the effects of convection are seriously felt
4/17/16, 17:17 - Cindy L: So if u stay on the bottom floor, it's freezing
4/17/16, 17:17 - Cindy L: OK u say let's go to the middle floors
4/17/16, 17:17 - Cindy L: That's where all the annoying people are
4/17/16, 17:18 - Cindy L: U get like groups of people speaking in weird European languages u have never even heard of.
4/17/16, 17:18 - Cindy L: There's always a few Koreans rolling around in the office chairs by the railings (why?)
4/17/16, 17:19 - Mom: the lse library is vey famous for its spiral architecture
4/17/16, 17:19 - Cindy L: Oh yea that spiral architecture.
4/17/16, 17:19 - Cindy L: Looks nice
4/17/16, 17:19 - Cindy L: But the steps
4/17/16, 17:19 - Cindy L: Omg the fucking stepa
4/17/16, 17:19 - Cindy L: They r not designed for actual use I swear
4/17/16, 17:19 - Mom: no lift??
4/17/16, 17:20 - Cindy L: There is lift, but what happens when everyone takes the lift eh
4/17/16, 17:20 - Mom: that's what architects do
4/17/16, 17:20 - Cindy L: And the people talking on the phones.
4/17/16, 17:20 - Cindy L: I mean, do people even TALK on the phone anymore
4/17/16, 17:20 - Mom: ic
4/17/16, 17:21 - Cindy L: Why do they only talk on the phone in the library
4/17/16, 17:21 - Cindy L: And esp in the silent zone
4/17/16, 17:21 - Cindy L: When they go out the they
4/17/16, 17:21 - Cindy L: Text
4/17/16, 17:21 - Cindy L: Wtf
4/17/16, 17:21 - Cindy L: Other than that the library is quite nice
4/17/16, 17:22 - Cindy L: üëç
4/17/16, 17:22 - Mom: then u shud give an angry look to those annoying ppl
4/17/16, 17:22 - Cindy L: Oh right, my friend who was doing architecture
4/17/16, 17:23 - Cindy L: Switched to major in environmental design instead
4/17/16, 17:23 - Cindy L: Lol
4/17/16, 17:23 - Mom: why?
4/17/16, 17:23 - Mom: architectural design no good?
4/17/16, 17:23 - Cindy L: Huh she said it was very pretentious
4/17/16, 17:23 - Mom: hahaha
4/17/16, 17:23 - Cindy L: Well it's mostly art
4/17/16, 17:24 - Mom: like the lse library design
4/17/16, 17:24 - Cindy L: What do u expect.
4/17/16, 17:24 - Mom: architecture is basically an art studies
4/17/16, 17:24 - Cindy L: Yea
4/17/16, 17:24 - Mom: a pragmatic library serving its purpose
4/17/16, 17:25 - Cindy L: That's why they say it's suitable for women
4/17/16, 17:25 - Mom: not rlly
4/17/16, 17:25 - Mom: it's not suitable for u
4/17/16, 17:25 - Cindy L: They r also horribly sexist as well
4/17/16, 17:25 - Mom: in architect field?
4/17/16, 17:25 - Cindy L: No here I meant
4/17/16, 17:26 - Mom: why?
4/17/16, 17:27 - Cindy L: Cuz they go to single sex grammar schools and don't meet the other gender until uni
4/17/16, 17:30 - Mom: üò∞
4/17/16, 17:31 - Cindy L: Hv u sorted out the credit card stuff though btw
4/17/16, 17:31 - Mom: tmr
4/17/16, 17:31 - Cindy L: Kk
4/17/16, 17:31 - Cindy L: Just asking
4/17/16, 17:32 - Mom: other than super tired, no hallucinations or vivid dreams?
4/17/16, 17:32 - Cindy L: No
4/17/16, 17:32 - Cindy L: They will come, dw
4/17/16, 17:33 - Mom: no stomach pain??
4/17/16, 17:33 - Cindy L: no
4/17/16, 17:33 - Mom: ok
4/17/16, 17:58 - Cindy L: I've had three countable naps alreafy
4/17/16, 18:14 - Mom: long or short nap?
4/17/16, 18:20 - Mom: how much u consumed that l-carnitine each time?
4/17/16, 19:11 - Cindy L: None
4/18/16, 01:54 - Cindy L: Hi
4/18/16, 01:55 - Cindy L: The being in the cold makes me sleepy
4/18/16, 01:55 - Cindy L: But I guess that happens for everybody
4/18/16, 02:28 - Mom: Then go sleep la
4/18/16, 02:46 - Cindy L: Sunday funday
4/18/16, 16:45 - Mom: hi

4/18/16, 17:24 - Cindy L: OK that was a LAN gag
4/18/16, 17:24 - Mom: alien language?
4/18/16, 17:24 - Cindy L: I'm in the lib
4/18/16, 17:25 - Cindy L: After dozing for 2 hr
4/18/16, 17:25 - Mom: have order acetyl-l-carnitine for u through amazon uk, will arrive tmr
4/18/16, 17:26 - Mom: sleep alot?
4/18/16, 17:26 - Mom: i rlly rlly doubt ur narcoleptic cuz u seem not matching the definition for narcolepsy???
4/18/16, 17:27 - Cindy L: Kk
4/18/16, 17:27 - Mom: other than sleepy all the time, any hallucinations or vivid dreams today?
4/18/16, 17:33 - Cindy L: Yeah very weird thing happened last night
4/18/16, 17:33 - Mom: vivid dream again?
4/18/16, 17:33 - Cindy L: I had SP around 30-60mins into sleep
4/18/16, 17:34 - Cindy L: And then I felt something tug the edges of my duvet cover really forcefully
4/18/16, 17:34 - Mom: sp for 30-60 mins, wow!!!
4/18/16, 17:34 - Cindy L: Like I saw it as well
4/18/16, 17:34 - Cindy L: No
4/18/16, 17:34 - Cindy L: The SP happened 30-60 mins into sleep
4/18/16, 17:34 - Mom: oh, ic
4/18/16, 17:35 - Cindy L: So I saw something pulling my suvet cover from the edge of my bed
4/18/16, 17:35 - Mom: u shud have slept after 30-60 mins after bed ?
4/18/16, 17:35 - Cindy L: OK I thought it was like a really big bug
4/18/16, 17:35 - Mom: üò±
4/18/16, 17:35 - Cindy L: Which was residing between the gap between the bed and wall
4/18/16, 17:36 - Cindy L: I got kind of worried cuz I couldn't move
4/18/16, 17:36 - Mom: a big bug????
4/18/16, 17:36 - Cindy L: I managed to get out of SP by forcefully moving my limbs
4/18/16, 17:36 - Cindy L: So when I got up
4/18/16, 17:37 - Cindy L: I pull out the bed to see what it waa
4/18/16, 17:37 - Cindy L: Was
4/18/16, 17:37 - Cindy L: And
4/18/16, 17:37 - Cindy L: There was nothing there.
4/18/16, 17:37 - Cindy L: Just dust
4/18/16, 17:37 - Mom: ofc
4/18/16, 17:37 - Cindy L: I changed the bed covers and everything in case they hid there
4/18/16, 17:38 - Cindy L: But I definitely SAW and felt something pull on my sheets really hard
4/18/16, 17:38 - Cindy L: However I was in sp
4/18/16, 17:38 - Cindy L: So I don't know if it was hallucination or real.
4/18/16, 17:39 - Mom: what the hell
4/18/16, 17:39 - Mom: this kind of hallucination shud only happen in kids having taken high dose of ritalin for long time
4/18/16, 17:40 - Mom: did u take any drug/supplements last night b4 sleep?
4/18/16, 17:40 - Cindy L: I meant to say I thought it was a bug but discovered it wasn't
4/18/16, 17:40 - Cindy L: I don't know what it was that pulled it.
4/18/16, 17:40 - Mom: yea, i know
4/18/16, 17:40 - Cindy L: No
4/18/16, 17:41 - Mom: not human being like something??
4/18/16, 17:41 - Cindy L: I actually went to take some l-theanine afterwards to help me sleep
4/18/16, 17:41 - Cindy L: I don't know
4/18/16, 17:41 - Mom: u thought that's a big bug but u rlly didn't see it??
4/18/16, 17:41 - Cindy L: I even searched for it when I woke up
4/18/16, 17:42 - Cindy L: I closed everything so it could hv gotten away.
4/18/16, 17:42 - Cindy L: Couldnt
4/18/16, 17:42 - Cindy L: So very strange
4/18/16, 17:42 - Mom: did u close ur door tightly?
4/18/16, 17:42 - Cindy L: Either my brain is super messed up or my room is haunted.
4/18/16, 17:43 - Mom: or someone else went into ur room in the mid-night?
4/18/16, 17:43 - Cindy L: Dude if it was a big bug, I would have saw it leave
4/18/16, 17:43 - Cindy L: A human being cannot fit between the gap between the bed and wall
4/18/16, 17:44 - Mom: btw, for 30-60 mins after sleep, u shud have fallen into sleep right?
4/18/16, 17:44 - Cindy L: Yes
4/18/16, 17:44 - Mom: so, was this a dream?
4/18/16, 17:44 - Cindy L: No sleep paralysis
4/18/16, 17:45 - Mom: u were awaken by that pulling force??
4/18/16, 17:45 - Cindy L: Yea
4/18/16, 17:45 - Mom: weird
4/18/16, 17:45 - Mom: can u sleep having taken the theanine after?
4/18/16, 17:46 - Cindy L: Sort of
4/18/16, 17:46 - Cindy L: Abt as well as a haunted/ crazy person can sleep
4/18/16, 17:47 - Mom: thb, ur experience didn't sound like a narcoleptic
4/18/16, 17:47 - Mom: and ur hallucinations like events were so frequent at london
4/18/16, 17:48 - Mom: btw, u still have to pretend not knowing anything
4/18/16, 17:48 - Mom: not to scare urself
4/18/16, 17:50 - Mom: just think that is a dream
4/18/16, 20:30 - Cindy L: I'm not scared
4/18/16, 20:31 - Cindy L: I pulled out the bed and looked for the bug and found nothing.
4/18/16, 20:31 - Cindy L: And then the thought that it might be a ghost passed my mind briefly
4/18/16, 20:32 - Cindy L: But surprisingly I wasn't really scared
4/18/16, 20:32 - Cindy L: Just annoyed.
4/18/16, 20:32 - Cindy L: Lol

4/19/16, 12:24 - Cindy L: I basically can't work before 12
4/19/16, 12:24 - Cindy L: My brain is still scrambled eggs before then
4/19/16, 12:25 - Cindy L: I just spent the last hr trying to answer the question.
4/19/16, 12:25 - Cindy L: Should I go NHS and get a note now.
4/19/16, 12:25 - Cindy L: ?
4/19/16, 12:28 - Cindy L: Or maybe I can just show the pmh one
4/19/16, 12:31 - Mom: Go to NHS
4/19/16, 12:32 - Mom: or ask ur advisor if she can help
4/19/16, 12:33 - Mom: If u take acetyl-l-carnitine, can u keep awake for the exam?
4/19/16, 12:34 - Mom: Moreover, don't eat bkf can help?
4/19/16, 12:50 - Mom: do u want to try the ALC i bought from amazon uk?
4/19/16, 12:50 - Mom: shall i ask them to arrange delivery again/
4/19/16, 13:09 - Mom: tell the nhs ur sleep symptoms only appear after u arrived uk, like jan16
4/19/16, 13:10 - Mom: if u tell them u've health probs since nov14 in hk, i'm afraid that nhs wudn't offer help???
4/19/16, 13:11 - Mom: ur offer package from ucl arrived here today, shall i open and see what's in it? or just keep it until u get back here in jun??
4/19/16, 14:29 - Cindy L: Yea open the ucl stuff and scan for me
4/19/16, 14:29 - Cindy L: I just need to see if they can reschedule my exams to later time.
4/19/16, 14:30 - Cindy L: I mean theres no point in taking modafinil now
4/19/16, 14:30 - Cindy L: And we know stimulants don't work on me
4/19/16, 14:30 - Cindy L: I did think abt taking a term out to try the antidepressants
4/19/16, 14:31 - Cindy L: I'm not talking to my advisor again lol üòí
4/19/16, 14:34 - Mom: why not talking to her? angry?
4/19/16, 14:35 - Mom: how do u get the antidepressants?
4/19/16, 14:35 - Mom: and nhs won't prescribe modafinil so easy right?
4/19/16, 14:38 - Cindy L: Erm I dunno
4/19/16, 14:39 - Cindy L: Lol I dun really wanna talk to my advisor about this
4/19/16, 14:39 - Cindy L: Can I not get antidepressants anymore in HK?
4/19/16, 14:39 - Cindy L: That's what I meant
4/19/16, 14:41 - Cindy L: I need a solution to the cataplexy
4/19/16, 14:42 - Mom: u didn't go to pwh for follow up, i don't think u can get it in short time
4/19/16, 14:42 - Cindy L: I see
4/19/16, 14:42 - Cindy L: Damn
4/19/16, 14:42 - Mom: ur case in pmh has ceased, i thought
4/19/16, 14:43 - Cindy L: üòï
4/19/16, 14:43 - Cindy L: But the medication is continuous
4/19/16, 14:43 - Cindy L: How can it cease?
4/19/16, 14:43 - Mom: unless u go to that Prof's private practice??
4/19/16, 14:44 - Cindy L: Anyways since I hv mich better records of my conditions right now, I think it is safer to try now.
4/19/16, 14:44 - Mom: pmh has transferred ur case to pwh for follow up b4 u went to uk that summer, rmb that?
4/19/16, 14:45 - Cindy L: Yea
4/19/16, 14:45 - Mom: but we didn't go to pwh for registration
4/19/16, 14:45 - Cindy L: Oh
4/19/16, 14:45 - Cindy L: So I needed to register
4/19/16, 14:45 - Mom: ofc
4/19/16, 14:45 - Cindy L: And quality health care has also ended my case
4/19/16, 14:45 - Cindy L: What abt the doctor in tst
4/19/16, 14:46 - Mom: there's a referral letter from pmh at the end of ur visit rmb? we need to bring this referral letter to pwh for follow up treatment
4/19/16, 14:46 - Cindy L: Oh right
4/19/16, 14:46 - Cindy L: But then will I need to go through testing again
4/19/16, 14:47 - Mom: u can go to QHS and ask that dr to write u a referral to private doc/public hosipital for further treatment
4/19/16, 14:48 - Mom: but u have to wait for months in hk
4/19/16, 14:48 - Mom: how wud u accommodate this appointment schedule if u got to return to uk or to us for summer course??
4/19/16, 14:49 - Cindy L: I see
4/19/16, 14:49 - Mom: if u want to continue ur treatment in hk, probably don't have to redo those testing
4/19/16, 14:49 - Cindy L: The US thing ends mid august
4/19/16, 14:50 - Mom: but if u gonna stay in uk, probably yes, cuz pre-existing condition is not covered in the nhs system, then u still have to sort out medication in hk
4/19/16, 14:50 - Cindy L: I need a fucking consultant.
4/19/16, 14:50 - Mom: US thing ends in mid-august, but u have to return to uk for studies right?
4/19/16, 14:50 - Cindy L: There is September
4/19/16, 14:51 - Mom: public hospital def can't accommodate ur request
4/19/16, 14:51 - Cindy L: I mean if I get them before mid august
4/19/16, 14:52 - Mom: get what?
4/19/16, 14:52 - Cindy L: And then I can try them from mid august to sep
4/19/16, 14:52 - Mom: antidepressants?
4/19/16, 14:52 - Cindy L: Yea they need time to build up right
4/19/16, 14:53 - Mom: u didn't take any antidepressant, it takes time to see reaction/effect and review drugs qualities periodically
4/19/16, 14:53 - Cindy L: Yea I know
4/19/16, 14:54 - Cindy L: After taking so many drugs
4/19/16, 14:54 - Mom: can u afford to come at appointment schedule?
4/19/16, 14:54 - Cindy L: No
4/19/16, 14:54 - Cindy L: I mean I don't count on doctor to do review
4/19/16, 14:54 - Cindy L: I just need to obtain them
4/19/16, 14:54 - Mom: so, it wud be better to treat ur case in uk if u're gonna stay for the next 3 yrs
4/19/16, 14:55 - Cindy L: Hey we still hv some effexor right
4/19/16, 14:55 - Mom: just 1 week?
4/19/16, 14:55 - Mom: can u see effect immediately?
4/19/16, 14:56 - Cindy L: What we just hv one week?
4/19/16, 14:56 - Cindy L: At least three weeks need.
4/19/16, 14:56 - Mom: def not 3 weeks
4/19/16, 14:57 - Mom: u can't get that drugs without dr's prescription
4/19/16, 14:58 - Cindy L: Yea.
4/19/16, 14:58 - Cindy L: Ik
4/19/16, 14:59 - Cindy L: I think I may continue with l l-carnitine on alternating daya
4/19/16, 14:59 - Cindy L: Days
4/19/16, 14:59 - Mom: i think this is also the reason why Leanne goes back to uk
4/19/16, 14:59 - Cindy L: Yea she said she got her medication from nhs
4/19/16, 14:59 - Mom: yea, bc she's a british
4/19/16, 15:00 - Mom: she can only get free medical treatment from uk
4/19/16, 15:01 - Cindy L: Hurr
4/19/16, 15:01 - Cindy L: Wtf I really need it
4/19/16, 15:02 - Mom: go to nhs
4/19/16, 15:03 - Mom: or come back to hk for treatment
4/19/16, 15:05 - Cindy L: OK so apparently if I tell them I hv narco and ask for it, I can get it.
4/19/16, 15:05 - Cindy L: According to thestudentroom
4/19/16, 15:05 - Mom: where in uk?
4/19/16, 15:05 - Mom: no
4/19/16, 15:05 - Cindy L: Nhs
4/19/16, 15:05 - Mom: pre-existing condition not covered, forget that
4/19/16, 15:06 - Cindy L: Someone was asking how easy it is to get antidepressants for depression
4/19/16, 15:06 - Mom: how easy?
4/19/16, 15:06 - Cindy L: Like I wrote up there.
4/19/16, 15:06 - Mom: if u tell nhs u have narco since in hk, they probably tell u to go back hk for treatment
4/19/16, 15:07 - Cindy L: I see
4/19/16, 15:07 - Cindy L: But what if I give that referral letter
4/19/16, 15:07 - Cindy L: Lol
4/19/16, 15:07 - Mom: forget the nhs policy on pre-existing conditons?
4/19/16, 15:07 - Mom: what referral letter? from the qhs dr?
4/19/16, 15:07 - Cindy L: Yeah
4/19/16, 15:08 - Mom: then that is a pre-existing conditon
4/19/16, 15:08 - Cindy L: But o rmber that girl who tried to get modafinil by pretending to be narco
4/19/16, 15:08 - Cindy L: They told her to rest
4/19/16, 15:08 - Cindy L: Hahaha
4/19/16, 15:08 - Mom: did she get that drug?
4/19/16, 15:08 - Mom: yea, def not easy
4/19/16, 15:09 - Cindy L: Yea so if I give proof
4/19/16, 15:09 - Cindy L: That would be OK right
4/19/16, 15:09 - Cindy L: And then problem is preexisting condition
4/19/16, 15:09 - Mom: if u tell them u had those conditons b4 coming to uk, what do u think they'll do?
4/19/16, 15:09 - Mom: just give u the drugs?
4/19/16, 15:09 - Cindy L: Yeah
4/19/16, 15:09 - Cindy L: Cuz I need it
4/19/16, 15:09 - Cindy L: Duh
4/19/16, 15:10 - Mom: don't be silly?  nhs policy explicitly states to exclude pre-exisiting health probs
4/19/16, 15:10 - Cindy L: What happens if I need it.
4/19/16, 15:11 - Mom: go there now, and tell them u had those conditions only in uk, preferably few months after arrival
4/19/16, 15:11 - Mom: and go through testing
4/19/16, 15:11 - Mom: until they're convinced
4/19/16, 15:11 - Cindy L: So if I was transferred to China for work for two years and I suddenly develop cancer and require treatment NHS won't treat me even though I am British national
4/19/16, 15:11 - Cindy L: Wtf
4/19/16, 15:11 - Cindy L: Extra wtf
4/19/16, 15:12 - Cindy L: Isn't the preexisting condition thing rather retarded
4/19/16, 15:12 - Mom: the prob is ur not ordinarily resided in uk
4/19/16, 15:12 - Cindy L: ....
4/19/16, 15:12 - Cindy L: But there r people who go away for like 5 or 10 years
4/19/16, 15:13 - Cindy L: Or should I go to NHS 3 years later
4/19/16, 15:13 - Mom: if ur ordinary resided in uk, ur entitled to nhs services even if u go to china for work
4/19/16, 15:13 - Mom: but ur not in this case
4/19/16, 15:13 - Mom: u just come for less than 1 yr
4/19/16, 15:13 - Cindy L: But I'm a reverse immigrant
4/19/16, 15:13 - Cindy L: Why things so complicated.
4/19/16, 15:13 - Mom: not necessary for 3 yrs
4/19/16, 15:14 - Mom: 6 months' will be better, i think
4/19/16, 15:14 - Cindy L: OK what if I pay for drug then
4/19/16, 15:14 - Cindy L: Buy insurance noe
4/19/16, 15:14 - Mom: then u got to see private dr
4/19/16, 15:14 - Cindy L: ....
4/19/16, 15:14 - Cindy L: I might as well get them on the silk road then
4/19/16, 15:15 - Mom: private specialist dr who can prescribe psychotics drugs
4/19/16, 15:15 - Cindy L: That means testing.
4/19/16, 15:15 - Cindy L: Again
4/19/16, 15:15 - Cindy L: Wrf
4/19/16, 15:15 - Mom: i have bought the study insurance for u
4/19/16, 15:15 - Mom: and that also cover ur sickness in uk
4/19/16, 15:15 - Mom: but those're psychotics drugs
4/19/16, 15:16 - Mom: i'm not sure if ur insurance cover or not
4/19/16, 15:16 - Mom: anyway, u need a prescription for those drugs
4/19/16, 15:16 - Cindy L: OK I'll go to NHS sometime
4/19/16, 15:16 - Cindy L: And ask
4/19/16, 15:17 - Mom: u can tell them ur symptoms start only in jan16
4/19/16, 15:17 - Cindy L: Not even six months ah
4/19/16, 15:17 - Cindy L: Dont count if not six months
4/19/16, 15:18 - Mom: i'm not sure actually
4/19/16, 15:18 - Cindy L: And If I have to tell a fabricated story again, I can't keep track.
4/19/16, 15:18 - Cindy L: Sorry
4/19/16, 15:18 - Mom: those policy statements don't write down everything clearly
4/19/16, 15:18 - Cindy L: U know what
4/19/16, 15:18 - Cindy L: I know someone with medical contacts
4/19/16, 15:18 - Cindy L: I'll dig around and see
4/19/16, 15:19 - Mom: do u have friends who have antidepressants?
4/19/16, 15:19 - Cindy L: No
4/19/16, 15:19 - Cindy L: I don't know any depressed people
4/19/16, 15:20 - Mom: u didn't sleep for 2 hrs last night? what did u do then?
4/19/16, 15:22 - Cindy L: Nothing
4/19/16, 15:22 - Cindy L: Anyways
4/19/16, 15:23 - Cindy L: Whatever.
4/19/16, 15:23 - Cindy L: I'll take the acetylcholine on alternating days for now
4/19/16, 15:23 - Mom: can't sleep, can't do anything?
4/19/16, 15:23 - Cindy L: Or else I can't revise
4/19/16, 15:23 - Cindy L: It's like insomnia
4/19/16, 15:24 - Mom: can i see ur bottle of ALC?
4/19/16, 15:26 - Cindy L: It's alc
4/19/16, 15:26 - Cindy L: Yeah later if I remember
4/19/16, 15:26 - Mom: later when u get back to ur dorm
4/19/16, 15:27 - Cindy L: Anyways I stopped taking them for two days
4/19/16, 15:27 - Cindy L: And they act fast
4/19/16, 15:27 - Mom: what's different?
4/19/16, 15:27 - Cindy L: So it can't be residual effects of alc
4/19/16, 15:27 - Cindy L: It's just that in the middle of the night in done remming.
4/19/16, 15:27 - Cindy L: That's all
4/19/16, 15:28 - Cindy L: The problem with alc is just that it suddenly lowers my hr and messes up my GI tract
4/19/16, 15:28 - Cindy L: Other than that I would take it.
4/19/16, 15:28 - Mom: the research papers didn't mention these kind of side-effect
4/19/16, 15:29 - Cindy L: Have u forgotten that my biochemistry is now signifanctly different to most people
4/19/16, 15:29 - Mom: do i need to redo amazon delivery again?
4/19/16, 15:30 - Mom: but alc is supposed to improve cardiovascular probs
4/19/16, 15:30 - Mom: but u now got opposite effect
4/19/16, 15:31 - Cindy L: Don't reorder stuff
4/19/16, 15:31 - Cindy L: I said i already a jar of alc
4/19/16, 15:32 - Cindy L: Have a jar
4/19/16, 15:32 - Mom: ok
4/19/16, 15:33 - Cindy L: It would be good if I can get either antidepressants (without being thrown into jail) or orexin itself
4/19/16, 15:33 - Mom: u must be kidding
4/19/16, 15:41 - Mom: to remind u, antidepressants will make u more sleepy
4/19/16, 16:14 - Cindy L: I did 0 work today
4/19/16, 16:14 - Cindy L: That is really depressing.
4/19/16, 16:20 - Mom: why? can't even do anything without alc?
4/19/16, 16:20 - Mom: u do wake up early this morning?
4/19/16, 16:21 - Mom: if u just sit in the lib and sleep, why don't change other area?
4/19/16, 16:24 - Mom: go back and take alc for work la
4/19/16, 16:31 - Cindy L: Not in a good mood today
4/19/16, 16:31 - Cindy L: I just wanna kick pigeons and shout at cars
4/19/16, 17:04 - Mom: how many days ur off alc?
4/19/16, 17:04 - Mom: 2 days?
4/19/16, 17:05 - Mom: and still can work for the past 2 days?
4/19/16, 17:05 - Mom: just not working at all today/
4/19/16, 17:05 - Mom: is the alc mood altering?
4/19/16, 17:06 - Mom: if u find those ppl in lib annoying, what abt staying at coffee shop?
4/19/16, 17:14 - Cindy L: I'm just nodding off all day
4/19/16, 17:14 - Cindy L: It has nothing to do with the environment
4/19/16, 17:14 - Mom: go back to ur dorm and take alc, okay?
4/19/16, 17:15 - Mom: can u work for the past 2 days without alc?
4/19/16, 17:17 - Cindy L: I worked yesterday
4/19/16, 17:18 - Cindy L: Cannot work today at all
4/19/16, 17:18 - Mom: without alc?
4/19/16, 17:18 - Cindy L: What do u mean
4/19/16, 17:18 - Cindy L: I don't know
4/19/16, 17:18 - Mom: i mean did u take alc yesterday?
4/19/16, 17:18 - Cindy L: No
4/19/16, 17:19 - Mom: how many days without alc?
4/19/16, 17:19 - Cindy L: 3
4/19/16, 17:19 - Mom: okay, then u probably can try alc every alternative day so u can work
4/19/16, 17:19 - Mom: go back to ur dorm and test it
4/19/16, 17:20 - Mom: how many times of alc did u normally take for the day?
4/19/16, 17:20 - Mom: once, twice or thrice?
4/19/16, 17:22 - Cindy L: The girl next to me I swear has add, she cannot stop moving.
4/19/16, 17:22 - Cindy L: Once
4/19/16, 17:22 - Mom: wow, those drugs r powerful or ur rlly sensitive to it
4/19/16, 17:23 - Mom: don't bother the girl next to u la
4/19/16, 17:23 - Mom: can u send me ur link for ucb's summer course payment?
4/19/16, 17:24 - Mom: then i don't need to disclose sensitive info over the internet?
4/19/16, 17:24 - Mom: i'll input the payment details for u
4/19/16, 17:39 - Cindy L: Oh ok
4/19/16, 20:10 - Cindy L: Ive finally fallen flat on campus
4/19/16, 20:10 - Cindy L: Great
4/19/16, 20:15 - Cindy L: My condition today seems to be extra bad
4/19/16, 21:45 - Cindy L: Went into rem in the library around 2130
4/19/16, 21:46 - Cindy L: Lose consciousness for abt 5 mins
4/20/16, 02:27 - Cindy L: Rem session seems to be related to bad condition persisting the whole day
4/20/16, 02:28 - Cindy L: As after the session, I got slightly better.
4/20/16, 00:09 - Mom: What happened?
4/20/16, 00:22 - Mom: did u hurt on falling?
4/20/16, 00:23 - Mom: did anyone help when u fell?
4/20/16, 00:24 - Mom: u mean u lost consciousness, remming? or fainted?
4/20/16, 00:25 - Mom: where ru now? in the hospital?
4/20/16, 00:49 - Mom: Pls keep ur phone in contact all the time?
4/20/16, 02:31 - Cindy L: No
4/20/16, 02:31 - Cindy L: I was lying face up on the pavement
4/20/16, 02:31 - Cindy L: My friend was nice enough to lie next to me
4/20/16, 02:32 - Cindy L: People in London don't give flying fucks abt people fainting on the floor
4/20/16, 02:33 - Cindy L: I had cataplexy if u didn't get it
4/20/16, 02:38 - Mom: i mean any special things happened b4 ur cataplectic episode?
4/20/16, 02:40 - Mom: after the session, u got slightly better ---> do u mean ur slightly better after the full blown?
4/20/16, 02:41 - Mom: and u said ur unconscious for abt 5 mins, is it just rem sleep in the lib at 2130?
4/20/16, 02:42 - Cindy L: Yes
4/20/16, 02:42 - Cindy L: 1. If u mean what was the stimulus, if was just me taking to other ppl. So funny things as normal
4/20/16, 02:43 - Cindy L: 2. Yes
4/20/16, 02:44 - Cindy L: 3. Yeah I think I went into rem but the kind of rem where I am still abt 40% conscious, so I start interpreting things weirdly
4/20/16, 02:44 - Cindy L: I thought my friend msg me abt looking for him in an orange hat
4/20/16, 02:44 - Cindy L: And then 5 mins later when I went back to look for that text msg, I couldn't find it.
4/20/16, 02:45 - Cindy L: Not sure why the brain makes shit up like so
4/20/16, 02:46 - Cindy L: It's like last time when I was reading manga and read three different endings which my mind generates by itself
4/20/16, 02:47 - Cindy L: Which makes me worried that if it can reconstruct short term memory like that, hopefully it hasn't decided to reconstruct my long term memories.
4/20/16, 02:48 - Mom: i wud say that ur in a dreaming session only, not ur short tem memory having probs
4/20/16, 02:48 - Mom: i had this experience as well
4/20/16, 02:49 - Cindy L: No as in its mixing dream elements which I'm guessing theupp brain generates things
4/20/16, 02:50 - Cindy L: No as in its mixing dream elements which I'm guessing are creative elements generated inside the brain
4/20/16, 02:50 - Mom: when u dream, ur brain is able to make up the missing part of ur story, either from ur past experience or just create it
4/20/16, 02:50 - Cindy L: With what it's receiving through sensory systems
4/20/16, 02:51 - Cindy L: I knew I worded it badly that u don't understand
4/20/16, 02:52 - Mom: sometimes, ppl dream of something never seen or done b4, do u think they're crazy??
4/20/16, 02:53 - Cindy L: No lah u totally do not understand what I'm saying
4/20/16, 02:53 - Cindy L: I did not fall alseep while remming
4/20/16, 02:53 - Mom: ur brain has the ability make up things, just we don't understand
4/20/16, 02:53 - Cindy L: U hear me
4/20/16, 02:53 - Cindy L: I DID NOT FALL ALSEEP
4/20/16, 02:54 - Cindy L: I'm quite certain u hv not experiences this before
4/20/16, 02:54 - Mom: this is not a matter of personal perception of sleep or not
4/20/16, 02:54 - Cindy L: .... r hdbdhsjdixusdh
4/20/16, 02:54 - Cindy L: Frustrating
4/20/16, 02:55 - Mom: when ur in rem, ur electrical impulse signal like awake but ur not actually awake
4/20/16, 02:55 - Mom: rmb the eeg interpretation of rem and awake?
4/20/16, 02:55 - Cindy L: U only know all of this from reading
4/20/16, 02:56 - Cindy L: I'm trying to tell u what is currently happening
4/20/16, 02:56 - Mom: i know, but i'm also trying to understanding what happened at ur side
4/20/16, 02:57 - Mom: but i did have those unexplained dream experience b4
4/20/16, 02:57 - Cindy L: It's not a fucking dream
4/20/16, 02:57 - Cindy L: How many times do I have to say it
4/20/16, 02:58 - Cindy L: Im calling it a rem session because the observable symptoms correlate to the the definition of rem I showed u last time
4/20/16, 02:59 - Cindy L: But it doesn't actually mean I know for certain that rem is actually happening
4/20/16, 02:59 - Cindy L: For one we don't know the density of the rem which is taking place, if remming at all.
4/20/16, 02:59 - Cindy L: Or the type of rem which is happening
4/20/16, 02:59 - Mom: ok, here's my experience few days b4
4/20/16, 03:00 - Mom: i was taking a short nap at noon
4/20/16, 03:00 - Mom: then i sudden sense that u have msg me: the screen showed hi,
4/20/16, 03:01 - Mom: then i thought u rlly msg me at the whatsapp
4/20/16, 03:01 - Mom: i got up from the couch
4/20/16, 03:01 - Mom: and look to the computer
4/20/16, 03:01 - Mom: but nothing there
4/20/16, 03:01 - Mom: do u think my short time memory has prob?
4/20/16, 03:01 - Mom: i don't think so
4/20/16, 03:02 - Cindy L: But where's the dream here
4/20/16, 03:02 - Mom: just from my nap b4 waking up
4/20/16, 03:02 - Cindy L: So ur sensation is not a dream
4/20/16, 03:03 - Cindy L: Or u just had a feeling that I might hv texted u
4/20/16, 03:03 - Mom: this is not from my sensation
4/20/16, 03:03 - Mom: i didn't rlly sense anything
4/20/16, 03:03 - Cindy L: I don't get how this is similar to my thing
4/20/16, 03:04 - Mom: u said u thought ur friend msg u in the lib?
4/20/16, 03:04 - Cindy L: I am actually seeing different versions of reality play out
4/20/16, 03:04 - Cindy L: I didn't get a feeling my friend msged me
4/20/16, 03:04 - Cindy L: I saw and read the msg
4/20/16, 03:05 - Mom: but at that time, u were nodding off with eyes already closed
4/20/16, 03:05 - Mom: u just saw the msg in ur mind
4/20/16, 03:06 - Cindy L: No that's what u assume
4/20/16, 03:06 - Mom: like me
4/20/16, 03:06 - Cindy L: Because I called it rem
4/20/16, 03:06 - Cindy L: But who knows what was happening
4/20/16, 03:07 - Mom: u rlly sure ur eyes were open at the time of having that episode?
4/20/16, 03:07 - Cindy L: No
4/20/16, 03:07 - Cindy L: How can I be sure
4/20/16, 03:07 - Cindy L: I'm not even sure if I do maths with my eyes open
4/20/16, 03:07 - Cindy L: But I still did the question
4/20/16, 03:07 - Cindy L: Like I still saw the msg
4/20/16, 03:07 - Mom: so the msg must be appearing in ur mind only not a different reality
4/20/16, 03:08 - Cindy L: So we strange imaginary things happen in real life
4/20/16, 03:08 - Cindy L: When
4/20/16, 03:08 - Cindy L: We tend to Call them hallucinations
4/20/16, 03:09 - Mom: not imagine, bc whenever u had similar episodes here in hk, i can tell that ur eyes r closed all the time
4/20/16, 03:10 - Mom: so how cud there be a different reality?
4/20/16, 03:10 - Cindy L: So say if right now, in my current fully alert condition,  I see a dog next to my bed what would u call it
4/20/16, 03:11 - Cindy L: The dog is not actually there
4/20/16, 03:11 - Mom: hallucination or demon
4/20/16, 03:11 - Cindy L: Let's just be scientific and go with hallucination
4/20/16, 03:11 - Cindy L: So say same thing, but my consciousness drops to abt 70% would u still give same answer?
4/20/16, 03:12 - Mom: demon is not unscientific cuz some ppl actually can detect those things with electric impulse
4/20/16, 03:12 - Cindy L: Just shut the fuck up and answer the question u quack
4/20/16, 03:13 - Mom: don't know
4/20/16, 03:13 - Cindy L: OK what abt 95% consciousness
4/20/16, 03:13 - Mom: having a vivid dream or hallucination?
4/20/16, 03:14 - Cindy L: It's one or the other can't be both
4/20/16, 03:15 - Mom: if i'm not 100% awake, i wud say that's a dream
4/20/16, 03:15 - Mom: cuz ur in a sleep state actually
4/20/16, 03:16 - Cindy L: Wow so if someone was like tired or not payinf attention  u would say what they see as vivid dreams
4/20/16, 03:17 - Mom: tired or unable to focus mean ur brain is actually tired
4/20/16, 03:18 - Mom: it might go into light sleep in any time
4/20/16, 03:18 - Cindy L: Yes but u would agree that person is actually awake
4/20/16, 03:19 - Mom: whether ur dreaming depends on how fast ur brain goes into rem state
4/20/16, 03:19 - Mom: not 100% awake, ready to go into sleep state
4/20/16, 03:19 - Cindy L: Just because u MIGHT go into rem anytime or slip into microsleep doesn't mean u will dream along with it
4/20/16, 03:19 - Mom: or specifically rest
4/20/16, 03:21 - Cindy L: But u would agree that dream does not necessarily mean it should involve the current environmental scenario around u
4/20/16, 03:21 - Mom: yea
4/20/16, 03:22 - Mom: btw, do u need to rest at this time?
4/20/16, 03:23 - Cindy L: Whatever I give up
4/20/16, 03:23 - Cindy L: I'm too frustrated trying to explain what happened to me
4/20/16, 03:26 - Mom: sigh....
4/20/16, 03:27 - Mom: do u think ur crazy at that moment when u saw ur friend's not real msg?
4/20/16, 03:30 - Mom: okay, if u saw a different reality, ur schizophrenic
4/20/16, 03:30 - Mom: do u actually want this kind of label???
4/20/16, 03:30 - Mom: before anything tests done?
4/20/16, 03:33 - Mom: it wud be a tragedy having been misdiagnosed and be deprived of opportunity to do other stuff
4/20/16, 03:34 - Mom: anyway, keep calm and take a rest
4/20/16, 03:34 - Cindy L: It's not about being fucking diagnosed and getting labels
4/20/16, 03:35 - Cindy L: It's abt finding out what the duck is happening to my brain
4/20/16, 03:35 - Cindy L: Because I happen to be the victim here and I want to be cured
4/20/16, 03:36 - Mom: so what do u think those episodes r? dream of hallucinations?
4/20/16, 03:37 - Cindy L: I'm looking online to find insight
4/20/16, 03:38 - Cindy L: They r  arguing able dream v. hallucinations as well
4/20/16, 03:38 - Mom: btw, give ur brain an opportunity to have enough rest
4/20/16, 03:38 - Cindy L: Don't u think I would be asleep if I can
4/20/16, 03:39 - Cindy L: It's not up to me is it.
4/20/16, 03:41 - Mom: don't want further argument, but if u consistently push ur sleep to later hrs, u brain wud have learnt to adapt to this situation and tell u to stay awake during later time
4/20/16, 03:41 - Cindy L: OK, for the sake of reporting, for visions which are close to being real life I will refer to as hallucinations; for those which hv more imaginary content and r more unbelievable I will refer to as dreams.
4/20/16, 03:41 - Mom: this is a learning process
4/20/16, 03:42 - Cindy L: Woe tell me how to tell my brain to go to sleep then.
4/20/16, 03:43 - Cindy L: While u r at it, also tell me how to tell my brain to stop fucking about and control my muscles properly. Thnx
4/20/16, 03:46 - Mom: the recovery process needs a med + therapeutic treatment which involves adapting a routine lifestyle
4/20/16, 03:46 - Mom: this is what those doc recommended
4/20/16, 03:48 - Mom: other than this, u can opt follow ur brain/body changed schedule
4/20/16, 03:49 - Mom: however, this wud put u into a separation from the society
4/20/16, 03:49 - Mom: and might impact ur mental health as well
4/20/16, 05:51 - Mom: ucl offer letter and prospectus is sent to ur gmail
4/20/16, 09:00 - Cindy L: Hi
4/20/16, 09:01 - Mom: Yea
4/20/16, 09:01 - Cindy L: So I fell asleep quote quickly after our heated debate
4/20/16, 09:01 - Cindy L: And I had a very weird dream
4/20/16, 09:01 - Cindy L: Im so weird I feel like the twilight zone.
4/20/16, 09:02 - Cindy L: Anyhow
4/20/16, 09:02 - Mom: U know, when we dream, our five senses still work
4/20/16, 09:02 - Cindy L: I dreamt of a white radio
4/20/16, 09:02 - Mom: Thats why I had so real sensations
4/20/16, 09:02 - Cindy L: Or like a speaker looking thing
4/20/16, 09:02 - Mom: *u
4/20/16, 09:03 - Cindy L: And it was sitting against a white background
4/20/16, 09:03 - Cindy L: That's all I saw
4/20/16, 09:03 - Cindy L: And then it was playing fm903
4/20/16, 09:04 - Cindy L: So I listened to jt
4/20/16, 09:04 - Cindy L: The picture did not change
4/20/16, 09:06 - Cindy L: And then sudden I hear this program called ÊÄ™Ë´á comes on
4/20/16, 09:06 - Cindy L: So scary stories, my mind went uh oh
4/20/16, 09:06 - Cindy L: Not goos
4/20/16, 09:06 - Cindy L: Goos
4/20/16, 09:06 - Cindy L: Good
4/20/16, 09:07 - Cindy L: But I don't know how to turn off the radio
4/20/16, 09:07 - Cindy L: Because I didn't know how to interact with the radio picture
4/20/16, 09:07 - Cindy L: Literally it was like I wasn't even a part of the dream
4/20/16, 09:09 - Mom: Then?
4/20/16, 09:11 - Cindy L: Then cuz I don't want to lisren
4/20/16, 09:13 - Cindy L: I kinda put on headphone
4/20/16, 09:13 - Cindy L: And I did the lahlahlah thing
4/20/16, 09:13 - Cindy L: So that I couldn't hear
4/20/16, 09:14 - Mom: Thereafter?
4/20/16, 09:15 - Cindy L: And then I woke up
4/20/16, 09:16 - Mom: Do u have ur headphone on when u woke up
?
4/20/16, 09:36 - Mom: for carnitine to have optimum effect, there must be adequate essential fatty acids (such as omega-3s) present in the diet.
4/20/16, 11:49 - Cindy L: I don't wear headphone to sleep
4/20/16, 11:49 - Cindy L: I have a portable speaker
4/20/16, 11:49 - Cindy L: But I didn't turn it on
4/20/16, 11:49 - Cindy L: That's why I take l-carnitine with milk
4/20/16, 11:50 - Cindy L: And I eat a lot of salmon so fatty acids is not really the issue here
4/20/16, 11:56 - Cindy L: Plus even if I was listening to music it doesn't explain why suddenly the radio would suddenly start playing ghost stories
4/20/16, 12:45 - Cindy L: Also isn't it creepy that there were almost no visuals at all
4/20/16, 12:45 - Cindy L: Imagine havign a dream where it's just sound... Even blind people see things.
4/20/16, 12:46 - Mom: do u mean ur portable speaker did produce sounds like turning to fm903?
4/20/16, 12:46 - Cindy L: No u can't get fm903 here.
4/20/16, 12:46 - Mom: ofc
4/20/16, 12:46 - Cindy L: I hv a Bluetooth speaker which I connect to my iPad to play music
4/20/16, 12:46 - Cindy L: That is it
4/20/16, 12:46 - Cindy L: No radio
4/20/16, 12:47 - Mom: also fm903 is not the radio playing ghosts stories
4/20/16, 12:47 - Cindy L: Yeah ikr
4/20/16, 12:47 - Mom: have u ever listened to fm903 b4?
4/20/16, 12:47 - Cindy L: I used to listen to 903 when I was small though
4/20/16, 12:48 - Mom: ic
4/20/16, 12:48 - Cindy L: The funny stuff
4/20/16, 12:48 - Cindy L: At night
4/20/16, 12:48 - Cindy L: More strangeness.
4/20/16, 12:49 - Cindy L: Also I think my condition was bad yesterday due to lack of sleep
4/20/16, 12:49 - Cindy L: I woke up at 9
4/20/16, 12:49 - Cindy L: So I probably missed the last block of sleep
4/20/16, 12:49 - Mom: what strange is it?
4/20/16, 12:50 - Cindy L: By strange I was talking abt the dream
4/20/16, 12:50 - Mom: the msg i sent u saying that l-carnitine shud be taken together with fish oil
4/20/16, 12:51 - Mom: it's purely a dream making up from ur memories and/or some other creativity, don't u think so?
4/20/16, 12:51 - Cindy L: Probably
4/20/16, 12:51 - Mom: but why happened at this moment?
4/20/16, 12:51 - Cindy L: Always tends towards scary stuff though
4/20/16, 12:51 - Mom: mysterious?
4/20/16, 12:52 - Cindy L: Maybe there's more activity in the amygdala that's why it's usually scary stuff
4/20/16, 12:53 - Mom: as i said above, when u dream, ur five senses r still working
4/20/16, 12:53 - Mom: that's why we've vivid dreams
4/20/16, 12:53 - Cindy L: Also my right eye is uncomfortable
4/20/16, 12:54 - Mom: now?
4/20/16, 12:54 - Cindy L: For quite a few weeks already
4/20/16, 12:54 - Mom: bc ur optic nerve is hurt, i think?

4/20/16, 13:42 - Mom: and u face has pimples?
4/20/16, 13:48 - Mom: the one u bought is l-carnitine which is different from acetyl-l-carnitine
4/20/16, 13:48 - Mom: former is mainly for weigh loss
4/20/16, 13:49 - Mom: latter is for neurological therapy and it can pass through the bbb
4/20/16, 13:57 - Cindy L: See the tiny acetyl as nice the world l-carnitine
4/20/16, 13:58 - Cindy L: I was trying to take a picture of what I look like when people tell me I look stoned.
4/20/16, 13:58 - Mom: u looked so dull and tired
4/20/16, 13:58 - Mom: looks like didn't sleep for a long long time
4/20/16, 14:00 - Mom: can u take a pic of the back of that bottle showing the nutrition value?

4/20/16, 14:06 - Cindy L: No I think the front camera is not very good
4/20/16, 14:06 - Cindy L: And the white balance is a bit too bright
4/20/16, 14:10 - Mom: if i were u, i won't pick the one u bought
4/20/16, 14:10 - Mom: i have compared a few other brands of acetyl-l-carnitine supplements
4/20/16, 14:11 - Cindy L: Okok lah order again
4/20/16, 14:11 - Mom: all have much better review and showed more clearly labeling
4/20/16, 14:11 - Cindy L: And more expensive
4/20/16, 14:11 - Mom: no, i was just thinking
4/20/16, 14:11 - Cindy L: I didn't think it would work either so I bought the cheapest one
4/20/16, 14:12 - Cindy L: <Media omitted>
4/20/16, 14:12 - Mom: üò±
4/20/16, 14:13 - Mom: i thought u look like a ghost
4/20/16, 14:13 - Cindy L: Mopps it's just black and white
4/20/16, 14:13 - Mom: and ur face is round
4/20/16, 14:14 - Cindy L: My face has been round since two summers ago
4/20/16, 14:14 - Mom: next time, if u want to do a trial, get the minimum quantity not the cheapest
4/20/16, 14:14 - Cindy L: Ok
4/20/16, 14:14 - Cindy L: I told u I don't seem to lose weight at all
4/20/16, 14:14 - Mom: btw, r those pimples on ur face?
4/20/16, 14:15 - Mom: me neither, i even get more pounds
4/20/16, 14:16 - Cindy L: Its when I squeeze the sebum out of my pores.
4/20/16, 14:16 - Cindy L: And then I squeeze too hard so I broke the skin
4/20/16, 14:16 - Mom: not healing? how long?
4/20/16, 14:16 - Cindy L: Like last week
4/20/16, 14:17 - Mom: do u have 974 ointment?
4/20/16, 14:17 - Cindy L: Yes
4/20/16, 14:17 - Mom: if u have, put some on them
4/20/16, 14:17 - Mom: it helps cure ur skin
4/20/16, 14:17 - Mom: put 2 times everyday, and it probably heals in 2-3 days
4/20/16, 14:19 - Mom: eat plain sandwiches like ham & egg sandwiches, which is good for controlling weigh
4/20/16, 14:19 - Mom: but u'll have to eat for like 2 weeks
4/20/16, 14:21 - Cindy L: Dude I've been eating less than that for more than 2 weeks
4/20/16, 14:21 - Cindy L: I've tried every single dieting advice u can find online
4/20/16, 14:21 - Cindy L: Why do u think I went into depressiin
4/20/16, 14:22 - Cindy L: So thanks for the sandwich but no thanma
4/20/16, 14:22 - Mom: üò©

4/20/16, 14:42 - Cindy L: I see what happened
4/20/16, 14:42 - Cindy L: All the Instagram shots were saved in my camera folder
4/20/16, 14:42 - Cindy L: That's how many tries I need to do to compose a shot
4/20/16, 14:56 - Mom: can u see ur some dark mark/shadow at the forehead?
4/20/16, 15:39 - Cindy L: Yep
4/20/16, 15:39 - Cindy L: It's like a dent
4/20/16, 15:40 - Cindy L: Ugh I slept till 3
4/20/16, 15:40 - Cindy L: Actually now I think abt it I only head out to library around 3
4/20/16, 15:41 - Mom: u slept at 4 am and woke up at 9 this morning?
4/20/16, 15:41 - Mom: without mid-wake up?
4/20/16, 15:41 - Cindy L: No I slept at 12
4/20/16, 15:41 - Cindy L: And then woke up at 0230
4/20/16, 15:41 - Mom: oh
4/20/16, 15:42 - Cindy L: And then argued with u until 4 something
4/20/16, 15:42 - Cindy L: Slept until abt 07:50
4/20/16, 15:42 - Cindy L: Took a shower
4/20/16, 15:42 - Cindy L: Then went to sleep at 9
4/20/16, 15:42 - Cindy L: Woke up at 11

4/20/16, 15:43 - Cindy L: Had lunch round 1230
4/20/16, 15:43 - Mom: and slept after lunch until now?
4/20/16, 15:44 - Mom: u took l-carnitine already, but still not having so much energy?
4/20/16, 15:44 - Cindy L: Fell asleep after lunch from 1300-1315
4/20/16, 15:45 - Cindy L: Then took the l-carnitine
4/20/16, 15:45 - Cindy L: Didn't take it properly so it probably won't hv effect today
4/20/16, 15:45 - Mom: ic
4/20/16, 15:46 - Mom: do it properly tmr la
4/20/16, 15:46 - Cindy L: So I was taking pictures until 1430
4/20/16, 15:46 - Cindy L: And then I went back to room to finally starting doing work
4/20/16, 15:47 - Cindy L: And then I think I slept for half an hr
4/20/16, 15:47 - Mom: no more fish oil at ur side?
4/20/16, 15:47 - Cindy L: So I woke up now
4/20/16, 15:47 - Cindy L: None
4/20/16, 15:47 - Cindy L: Dont send
4/20/16, 15:47 - Cindy L: No space
4/20/16, 15:47 - Cindy L: Milk is fine
4/20/16, 15:47 - Mom: ok
4/20/16, 15:48 - Mom: better take the l-carnitine after waking up in the morning right?
4/20/16, 15:48 - Cindy L: So u see this sleeping schedule
4/20/16, 15:48 - Cindy L: Wtf
4/20/16, 15:48 - Mom: this seems even worse than that in hk
4/20/16, 15:48 - Cindy L: I'm worse than those ppl pulling all nighters night after night
4/20/16, 15:49 - Mom: back to ur yr 13, u still can work
4/20/16, 15:49 - Mom: but why things getting worse like that
4/20/16, 15:49 - Cindy L: Yr 13 actually had so little work
4/20/16, 15:49 - Mom: more stress or work at lse?
4/20/16, 15:50 - Cindy L: The stuff u learn in HS is only equivalent to like abt 4 weeks here
4/20/16, 15:53 - Cindy L: Btw the u know the UC link will expire within 24 hrs right?
4/20/16, 15:53 - Mom: yea, i will do it tmr in the afternoon hk time
4/20/16, 15:53 - Cindy L: Kk
4/20/16, 15:54 - Cindy L: Ty
4/20/16, 15:54 - Mom: btw, do u have the energy to do ur summer course?
4/20/16, 15:54 - Mom: don't u worry abt ur sleeping prob in ucb?
4/20/16, 15:54 - Cindy L: We'll see
4/20/16, 15:55 - Cindy L: It's not like if I take a long break everything will return to norm
4/20/16, 15:55 - Cindy L: Doesn't work like that
4/20/16, 15:55 - Mom: .....
4/20/16, 15:56 - Mom: ok, if u have time, go check ur gut at nhs
4/20/16, 15:56 - Cindy L: Hahaha how
4/20/16, 15:56 - Cindy L: Say I hv IBS?
4/20/16, 15:57 - Mom: many bloating and acid reflu
4/20/16, 15:57 - Mom: reflux
4/20/16, 15:57 - Cindy L: Yeah sure
4/20/16, 15:57 - Mom: stomach pain srsly
4/20/16, 15:57 - Mom: i had srs stomach pain b4 and i went to a&e and have gut testing
4/20/16, 15:58 - Cindy L: Hopefully they don't cut me open
4/20/16, 15:58 - Cindy L: Cuz I actually hv none of those
4/21/16, 04:30 - Cindy L: So I've worked out why acetylcholine helps
4/21/16, 04:31 - Mom: ?
4/21/16, 04:31 - Mom: intermediate woke up again?
4/21/16, 04:31 - Cindy L: <Media omitted>
4/21/16, 04:31 - Cindy L: Yes
4/21/16, 04:31 - Cindy L: 04 am
4/21/16, 04:33 - Cindy L: Technically I feel like the 12- (whatever intermediatary wakeup time) bloc of sleep is the post dinner nap
4/21/16, 04:33 - Mom: sorry, don't understand quite well
4/21/16, 04:34 - Cindy L: üòë
4/21/16, 04:34 - Cindy L: For example if I sleep from 12-4
4/21/16, 04:34 - Cindy L: That is post dinner nap
4/21/16, 04:35 - Cindy L: And then I actually start sleeping the night time bloc round 6
4/21/16, 04:35 - Cindy L: Wtf
4/21/16, 04:35 - Cindy L: Nvm
4/21/16, 04:35 - Cindy L: Doesnt make sense
4/21/16, 04:36 - Mom: what's 12-bloc?
4/21/16, 04:36 - Cindy L: Like the 12-4
4/21/16, 04:36 - Cindy L: Or 12-230
4/21/16, 04:37 - Cindy L: I wake up at different random times each night
4/21/16, 04:37 - Mom: is that from ur reading? i can't read the whole page
4/21/16, 04:37 - Cindy L: <Media omitted>
4/21/16, 04:37 - Mom: so don't rlly understand that concept
4/21/16, 04:38 - Cindy L: I just screenshoted the rest for you
4/21/16, 04:39 - Cindy L: Basically cytokines are proinflammatory signalling cells
4/21/16, 04:39 - Mom: read that but it didn't say what's 12-bloc?
4/21/16, 04:40 - Cindy L: JUST FORGET ABT THE FUCKING 12-BLOC
4/21/16, 04:40 - Mom: ok
4/21/16, 04:40 - Mom: then
4/21/16, 04:41 - Cindy L: From now on we venture into a lot of immunology stuff
4/21/16, 04:42 - Mom: ur photo on whatsapp is so horrible?
4/21/16, 04:42 - Mom: like a demon child
4/21/16, 04:42 - Cindy L: Can u leave that alone
4/21/16, 04:42 - Mom: okok
4/21/16, 04:42 - Cindy L: I'm trying to talk science?
4/21/16, 04:43 - Mom: i'm listening
4/21/16, 04:43 - Mom: so ur findings abt why u consistently wake up at 4?
4/21/16, 04:43 - Cindy L: No my findings abt why aCh seems to work
4/21/16, 04:44 - Mom: i read the mechanism of Ach already
4/21/16, 04:44 - Cindy L: Btw
4/21/16, 04:45 - Cindy L: Which part of the spinal column is my scoliosis at?
4/21/16, 04:45 - Mom: ur prob to be specific shud be: unable to maintain sleep for more than 3-4 hrs?
4/21/16, 04:45 - Mom: around the hip?
4/21/16, 04:45 - Cindy L: It should be abt T6 or 7 right
4/21/16, 04:46 - Mom: keep me chec
4/21/16, 04:46 - Cindy L: It says on the x-ray reports
4/21/16, 04:46 - Mom: check
4/21/16, 04:48 - Mom: ur x-rays not here, can't check
4/21/16, 04:48 - Cindy L: Oh
4/21/16, 04:48 - Cindy L: Nvm
4/21/16, 04:49 - Cindy L: Anyways seems like ACH reduced inflammation
4/21/16, 04:49 - Cindy L: Reduces
4/21/16, 04:50 - Cindy L: Damn autocorrect
4/21/16, 04:50 - Mom: what ru trying to say?
4/21/16, 04:51 - Cindy L: That something inside my body is chronically inflammed?
4/21/16, 04:52 - Mom: ur E.S.R# already said that
4/21/16, 04:52 - Cindy L: Yea my medical record also says I hv narco
4/21/16, 04:52 - Cindy L: Just confirming it.
4/21/16, 04:53 - Cindy L: So apparently the vns has anti inflammatory properties
4/21/16, 04:54 - Mom: the sleep pattern doesn't match the definition of narco, instead it is more of a hypersomnia
4/21/16, 04:54 - Mom: possible causes: spinal inflammation or gut??
4/21/16, 04:54 - Cindy L: But the thing is how do u link my cataplexy symptoms and hypersomnia symptoms together
4/21/16, 04:55 - Cindy L: I was thinking it's might be spinal inflammation
4/21/16, 04:55 - Mom: sorry, can't figure out why ur cataplexy comes out so fast and seems severe
4/21/16, 04:55 - Cindy L: Cuz I t6 seems to be were the vns is connected to stomach
4/21/16, 04:56 - Mom: rmb i asked u abt ur injury from doing sit up at he tsing yi promenade?
4/21/16, 04:57 - Cindy L: Yes
4/21/16, 04:57 - Cindy L: It's not from that
4/21/16, 04:57 - Cindy L: Inflammation most likely from scoliosis
4/21/16, 04:57 - Mom: i did have thought that ur spine is injured since that time and that cuz the cataplexy
4/21/16, 04:58 - Cindy L: Cataplexy started before that though
4/21/16, 04:58 - Cindy L: So that cannot be cause
4/21/16, 04:59 - Mom: ur scoliosis is the minimal case, if scoliosis wud cuz such a hugh inflammation, then probably alot of ppl having much more severe scoliosis get narco??
4/21/16, 05:00 - Cindy L: That's true.
4/21/16, 05:01 - Cindy L: So most we can conclude is that t6 is probably a vulnerability cuz of scoliosis
4/21/16, 05:02 - Mom: do u still have back pain at the area around ur scoliosis point?
4/21/16, 05:02 - Cindy L: No
4/21/16, 05:05 - Cindy L: This is so frustrating
4/21/16, 05:05 - Cindy L: I was lying in front of kcl yesterday
4/21/16, 05:05 - Mom: again?
4/21/16, 05:06 - Mom: did u have friend together?
4/21/16, 05:06 - Cindy L: Yea no thanks to them
4/21/16, 05:06 - Mom: long time or short time recovery?
4/21/16, 05:08 - Mom: too funny again?
4/21/16, 05:08 - Cindy L: Same
4/21/16, 05:08 - Cindy L: Symptoms of cataplexy don't change
4/21/16, 05:08 - Cindy L: Cuz my neurons r ded
4/21/16, 05:09 - Mom: so frustrating
4/21/16, 05:10 - Cindy L: No shit
4/21/16, 05:10 - Cindy L: Hopefully I don't end up on the school newspaper
4/21/16, 05:11 - Mom: ....
4/21/16, 05:12 - Cindy L: They might think I'm an activist or some liberal feminist shit
4/21/16, 05:13 - Mom: who? and why?
4/21/16, 05:13 - Cindy L: Cuz this is the lse
4/21/16, 05:13 - Mom: lse doesn't allow those kind of ppl?
4/21/16, 05:14 - Cindy L: No because those kind of aimless people gather at lse
4/21/16, 05:15 - Mom: so what's the link between those ppl and ur cataplexy?
4/21/16, 05:15 - Cindy L: There is no link
4/21/16, 05:15 - Cindy L: Or the link is lying on the floor
4/21/16, 05:16 - Cindy L: London streets r quite clean as well
4/21/16, 05:16 - Mom: ha ha ha
4/21/16, 05:17 - Mom: when is ur second sleep block?
4/21/16, 05:17 - Cindy L: I don't know
4/21/16, 05:17 - Cindy L: Whenever I get tired
4/21/16, 05:18 - Mom: can u do ur reading between these wakeful period?
4/21/16, 05:18 - Cindy L: Hahaha yes
4/21/16, 05:19 - Cindy L: But that is not the point
4/21/16, 05:19 - Cindy L: I spent two hrs trying to draw a histogram
4/21/16, 05:21 - Cindy L: And then the girl opposite me goes, wtf this is so easy they give u 8 marks for drawing a histogram
4/21/16, 05:22 - Mom: so ur prob is?
4/21/16, 05:22 - Cindy L: I cry a bit on the inside
4/21/16, 05:23 - Cindy L: It's very difficult to draw a histogram u know
4/21/16, 05:23 - Mom: ru telling me that u have probs in doing such an easy task?
4/21/16, 05:24 - Mom: and then u cried for that?
4/21/16, 05:34 - Cindy L: I didn't cry it was a figure of speech
4/21/16, 05:34 - Cindy L: Like being disappointed
4/21/16, 05:34 - Cindy L: And yes I hv prob doing such an easy task, that's why I'm frustrated
4/21/16, 05:35 - Mom: what actually is the prob? nodding off all the time or cognition?
4/21/16, 05:36 - Cindy L: Before 1500, basically I can't do any work
4/21/16, 05:37 - Cindy L: Sometimes I go into deeper naps then it's nodding off all the time
4/21/16, 05:37 - Cindy L: If I go into light naps, I retain a bit of consciousness and my mind is stuck in that hell for a few hrs
4/21/16, 05:38 - Mom: so ur sleep prob is worsening cuz u still can do ur ib exam last yr?
4/21/16, 05:40 - Mom: yes? no?
4/21/16, 05:42 - Mom: if this is the case, u have to talk to lse admin or disability office for advice of rescheduling ur exam time?
4/21/16, 05:48 - Mom: shud i pay for ur ucb summer course?
4/21/16, 07:07 - Cindy L: Yea I wanna switch after all
4/21/16, 07:08 - Mom: what do u mean?

4/21/16, 07:09 - Cindy L: Probably gonna shower
4/21/16, 07:09 - Mom: for only 90 mins?
4/21/16, 07:09 - Cindy L: Yea
4/21/16, 07:09 - Mom: omg
4/21/16, 07:10 - Mom: how fragment is that!!!
4/21/16, 07:10 - Mom: sleep another block if u can
4/21/16, 07:10 - Cindy L: Calm down
4/21/16, 07:10 - Cindy L: Rem cycles r like this
4/21/16, 07:11 - Mom: sleep cycles r like that but u can't continue one by one cycle
4/21/16, 07:11 - Cindy L: What u mean
4/21/16, 07:12 - Cindy L: I hv no nrem
4/21/16, 07:12 - Cindy L: So I can't connect them
4/21/16, 07:12 - Cindy L: I guess
4/21/16, 07:12 - Cindy L: Not too sure
4/21/16, 07:12 - Mom: yea, u do have nrem
4/21/16, 07:12 - Mom: ur just sleep in one sleep cycle everytime
4/21/16, 07:13 - Mom: and wake up and wait for another sleep cycle to come
4/21/16, 07:13 - Cindy L: Yea
4/21/16, 07:13 - Cindy L: What else do I do
4/21/16, 07:13 - Mom: u usually sleep for 3-4 hrs everytime, this is abt the duration of 2 sleep cycles
4/21/16, 07:14 - Mom: for a normal person, they usually sleep 4-5 cycles to get enough sleep
4/21/16, 07:14 - Cindy L: I see
4/21/16, 07:14 - Cindy L: Lemme think
4/21/16, 07:14 - Mom: in total u sleep for abt 5 cycles right?
4/21/16, 07:15 - Cindy L: Yea 4
4/21/16, 07:15 - Cindy L: Or 5
4/21/16, 07:15 - Mom: exactly, total sleep time not rlly too much
4/21/16, 07:16 - Cindy L: Right so if I can make 5 cycles I get enough sleep
4/21/16, 07:16 - Cindy L: But rem cycles vary in length for normal ppl right
4/21/16, 07:17 - Mom: yea
4/21/16, 07:17 - Cindy L: Do they become longer or shorter
4/21/16, 07:17 - Mom: beginning rem shorter, increase during the night and longest the end
4/21/16, 07:17 - Mom: so ppl used to rmb dreams just b4 wake up
4/21/16, 07:18 - Cindy L: Right
4/21/16, 07:18 - Cindy L: I'm other way round
4/21/16, 07:18 - Mom: not rlly
4/21/16, 07:18 - Mom: narco is actually a dysfunction on rem sleep process
4/21/16, 07:19 - Mom: narcoleptic just have rem sleep in very short time after sleep, but it doesn't mean they rem all the way through their sleep time
4/21/16, 07:20 - Cindy L: What u mean?
4/21/16, 07:20 - Mom: what?
4/21/16, 07:21 - Mom: the prob is rem sleep
4/21/16, 07:21 - Mom: so if antidepressant is taken to reduce rem, it'll bounced back later
4/21/16, 07:22 - Cindy L: No I mean u said it doesn't mean they rem all the way
4/21/16, 07:22 - Cindy L: So I nrem too?
4/21/16, 07:22 - Cindy L: How much
4/21/16, 07:22 - Mom: ofc
4/21/16, 07:23 - Mom: had to be detected by machine
4/21/16, 07:23 - Mom: u know, dreams only happen in relatively short time during ur sleep
4/21/16, 07:23 - Cindy L: Ic
4/21/16, 07:23 - Mom: but u think it's long
4/21/16, 07:23 - Cindy L: Yea I can make two dreams in 15 min
4/21/16, 07:24 - Mom: those 2 dreams def don't total in 15 mins, might be less
4/21/16, 07:25 - Cindy L: Oh woe
4/21/16, 07:26 - Mom: do more research on acetylcholine, gaba receptor
4/21/16, 07:26 - Mom: these two might help reduce sleepiness in the daytime
4/21/16, 07:29 - Mom: u can read and do ur maths probs normally if not nodding off right?
4/21/16, 07:38 - Cindy L: Yes
4/21/16, 07:39 - Cindy L: I already tried gaba
4/21/16, 07:39 - Cindy L: It worsened the cataplexy too much
4/21/16, 07:40 - Cindy L: Good for supressing SP though
4/21/16, 07:41 - Mom: not telling u to try gaba, it's in pns system
4/21/16, 07:42 - Mom: just gaba might find reasons for hypersomnia
4/21/16, 07:43 - Mom: how do u know ur SP is supressed by gaba?
4/21/16, 10:29 - Cindy L: Cuz whenever I hv paranoia I take the precursor
4/21/16, 10:29 - Cindy L: I meant I tried the precursor
4/21/16, 10:29 - Cindy L: I know u can't take gaba

4/21/16, 16:57 - Cindy L: He doesn't seem to be here
4/21/16, 16:57 - Mom: why didn't u jump into their conversation at that time so u knew whether ur dreaming?

4/21/16, 16:58 - Cindy L: I wanted to listen
4/21/16, 16:58 - Mom: they might just left immediate after chatting?
4/21/16, 16:58 - Cindy L: I meant I looked for them in their rooms as well
4/21/16, 16:59 - Mom: is it possible that they just left the dorm right away?
4/21/16, 17:00 - Cindy L: No u can hear everything like doors opening and closing
4/21/16, 17:00 - Mom: why u always sleep in the kitchen?
4/21/16, 17:00 - Cindy L: Cuz I just had udon
4/21/16, 17:00 - Mom: u mean no door closing sound?

4/21/16, 17:03 - Mom: why the hell u dream of them?
4/21/16, 17:04 - Cindy L: I dunno
4/21/16, 17:04 - Mom: will it be possible that they left the dorm at the opposite side?
4/21/16, 17:04 - Cindy L: No I just went theree
4/21/16, 17:04 - Cindy L: It was also more hallucinatory like
4/21/16, 17:04 - Mom: if u rlly want to confirm, just ask them when u see them again?
4/21/16, 17:05 - Mom: how long u slept there?
4/21/16, 17:06 - Cindy L: Like a bit
4/21/16, 17:06 - Mom: perhaps they left when ur asleep and u didn't realize somebody's leaving sound?
4/21/16, 17:06 - Cindy L: I start shaking
4/21/16, 17:06 - Cindy L: So I lie down on table

4/21/16, 19:00 - Mom: not tired or sleepy?

4/21/16, 19:53 - Mom: tty in thr morning cuz it's mid-night here

4/21/16, 22:08 - Cindy L: 60mins undisturbed
4/21/16, 22:08 - Cindy L: Probably cuz I had some sake before as well
4/22/16, 00:20 - Mom: Hahaha
4/22/16, 00:36 - Cindy L: Omg so nice here
4/22/16, 00:36 - Cindy L: Until some ASSHOLE thought it was a good idea to sing his heart out.
4/22/16, 12:29 - Cindy L: Fuckkkkk
4/22/16, 12:29 - Cindy L: Alcohol is too sedating
4/22/16, 12:30 - Cindy L: I just slept 10 hrs
4/22/16, 12:30 - Cindy L: Plus Im also inflammed
4/22/16, 12:30 - Cindy L: My skin is bad this week and breaking
4/22/16, 12:54 - Cindy L: In conclusion, sleep better using something which works on gaba, more alert with something which works on aCh
4/22/16, 13:00 - Mom: why drink alcohol?
4/22/16, 13:00 - Mom: not good for ur stomach
4/22/16, 13:00 - Mom: ur right, stimuli on gaba and Ach have opposite effect
4/22/16, 13:01 - Mom: just woke up?
4/22/16, 13:49 - Mom: wake up la cindy, no good to get drunk
4/22/16, 14:05 - Cindy L: Not drunk lah i only had one glass
4/22/16, 14:05 - Cindy L: Thats like recommended amount which is good for ur heart
4/22/16, 14:06 - Cindy L: And i had it with ramen
4/22/16, 14:06 - Cindy L: Lol
4/22/16, 14:18 - Mom: that alcohol must be of high deg
4/22/16, 14:18 - Mom: sage?
4/22/16, 14:37 - Cindy L: No lah i did two hrs of math before i went to sleepp
4/22/16, 14:42 - Cindy L: Oh yah
4/22/16, 14:42 - Cindy L: I got an offer from urbanest kings cross
4/22/16, 14:42 - Cindy L: Should i play the deposit just in case
4/22/16, 14:43 - Cindy L: Its like 205pp for a room in a two person flat for 50 weeks, not too bad.
4/22/16, 14:45 - Mom: ru going to ucl?
4/22/16, 14:45 - Mom: then why still pay deposit for lse's dorm?
4/22/16, 14:46 - Mom: ur a bit illogical
4/22/16, 14:46 - Cindy L: If I'm going to ucl I will still need dorm
4/22/16, 14:46 - Cindy L: And I don't know if I'm guaranteed a place in ucl dorms
4/22/16, 14:46 - Cindy L: Especially when they only hv two halls
4/22/16, 14:47 - Mom: what? have u read the prospectus? they have numerous dorm
4/22/16, 14:47 - Mom: p15
4/22/16, 14:48 - Cindy L: Those r houses
4/22/16, 14:48 - Mom: not available for first yr student?
4/22/16, 14:49 - Cindy L: Wait I'm heading to lib, I'll check the prospectus again
4/22/16, 14:49 - Cindy L: Though 205 in a two person flat is not bad
4/22/16, 14:51 - Mom: i don't recommend paying deposit so early
4/22/16, 14:51 - Mom: and btw how much for the deposit?
4/22/16, 14:51 - Cindy L: Dunno
4/22/16, 14:51 - Cindy L: Probably like one or two weeks
4/22/16, 14:51 - Mom: and any refund if not going?
4/22/16, 14:52 - Cindy L: Maybe, need to check
4/22/16, 14:52 - Cindy L: Btw now is not early Westminster is all taken already
4/22/16, 14:52 - Mom: and if ur not going to stay in lse, wud they still allow u to stay in their dorm?
4/22/16, 14:52 - Cindy L: Yah I think so
4/22/16, 14:53 - Cindy L: The accommodation is separate from main lse admin
4/22/16, 14:54 - Mom: all taken?
4/22/16, 14:55 - Mom: unbelivable??
4/22/16, 14:59 - Cindy L: Yea they hv quota for second yr
4/22/16, 15:01 - Mom: anyway, also chk the ucl's residence
4/22/16, 16:15 - Cindy L: Was doing well since I didn't eat anything this morning
4/22/16, 16:15 - Cindy L: Until I had like a few chuncks of meat
4/22/16, 16:16 - Cindy L: I got to library around 1515
4/22/16, 16:16 - Cindy L: Found a spot
4/22/16, 16:16 - Cindy L: And then slept like the dead for 30 mins
4/22/16, 16:16 - Cindy L: Lol.
4/22/16, 16:17 - Cindy L: I had abt half the chunk of jamon ham I buy to roast from sainsbury
4/22/16, 16:18 - Mom: no ALC taken?
4/22/16, 16:18 - Mom: no dreams?
4/22/16, 16:19 - Mom: during that 30 mins sleep?
4/22/16, 16:20 - Mom: when u said u didn't eat anything in the morning, not including any liquid food like yogurt or milk or porridge?
4/22/16, 16:20 - Mom: even without any water?
4/22/16, 17:07 - Cindy L: Nothing
4/22/16, 17:08 - Cindy L: Didn't even step outside of my room until 2
4/22/16, 17:08 - Cindy L: When I was going to go to the lib
4/22/16, 17:08 - Cindy L: I saw the leftover ham in the fridge and though I might eat finish that.
4/22/16, 17:09 - Cindy L: I barely keep anything in the fridge nowadays
4/22/16, 17:09 - Mom: if u fast, how long u can stay without food for a day?
4/22/16, 17:38 - Cindy L: I dunno until dinner?
4/22/16, 17:39 - Cindy L: Im trying to find the threshold
4/22/16, 17:39 - Cindy L: This reminds me if my friends dog who had seizures if it ate too much at a time.
4/22/16, 18:31 - Cindy L: Not sure why I slipped into rem (shaking) around 1815
4/22/16, 18:31 - Cindy L: Was working in the silent zone
4/22/16, 18:32 - Cindy L: Managed to do abt 8 stats qs before this happened.
4/22/16, 19:24 - Cindy L: Ok went back to dorm, shaking persisted but not loss of consciousness
4/22/16, 19:24 - Cindy L: No loss
4/23/16, 00:42 - Mom: ur shaking? rem? might be a delay reaction of the food?
4/23/16, 00:43 - Mom: and ur shaking persisted for long time after going back to dorm?
4/23/16, 00:43 - Mom: actually, was that rem sleep and having dream or just muscles trembling?
4/23/16, 01:09 - Mom: abt ur acommodation next yr, if u choose 50 wks, what will u do with that extra 10 wks summer term? stay there or leave it vacant?
4/23/16, 01:09 - Mom: no more 38 wks or 40 wks dorms?
4/23/16, 02:16 - Cindy L: Just shaking in the beginning
After shaking for a while start seeing small hallucinations in reflections or corner of eye
I say hallucinations because I'm fully aware they r not real and I am not dreaming.
Is it REM? The motions definitely look like rem, except I'm not asleep, sometimes a session can be broken up like this, very weird
4/23/16, 02:17 - Cindy L: Not sure abt duration, no markers or texts to ref to
4/23/16, 02:18 - Cindy L: Abt accommodation, 50 weeks I can stay here over summer and do apply to be research assistant or do internship
4/23/16, 02:18 - Cindy L: U can also sublet to summer student
4/23/16, 02:19 - Cindy L: 38/ 40 r reserved for first yr or gen course unfortunately
4/23/16, 02:24 - Cindy L: Also possibly ovulation as cause of bad inflammation right now
4/23/16, 02:45 - Mom: almost 03am, take a rest la
4/23/16, 03:05 - Cindy L: Was eating
4/23/16, 03:15 - Mom: abt accommodation, if ur planning to stay there for summer intern that will be fine, but if u think u can sublet, possibly not cuz ur tenancy agreement must have terms disapproving this
4/23/16, 03:15 - Mom: also, possibility and cost to find a summer student is that easy? i think most ppl rather prefer going to trip instead of doing summer courses
4/23/16, 03:15 - Mom: abt ur shaking incident, my reasoning is:
4/23/16, 03:15 - Mom: 1. something trigger ur brain nerve to over-react suddenly
4/23/16, 03:15 - Mom: 2.  shaking begins
4/23/16, 03:15 - Mom: 3.  brain nerve cells fire abnormally
4/23/16, 03:15 - Mom: 4.  which also stimulates ur memories and optic nerves to create images inside ur head
4/23/16, 03:15 - Mom: 5.  ur eyes wud probably be closed at the moment
4/23/16, 03:15 - Mom: 6.  the images u saw were inside ur head, not the current environment/reality
4/23/16, 03:15 - Mom: 7.  don't know if these r rem/hallucinations???
4/23/16, 03:16 - Mom: eating at 03am?
4/23/16, 03:16 - Mom: def not good
4/23/16, 03:17 - Mom: 8.  back to #1, what is the triggering event? food process?  adrenaline?  low BP? insulin resistance?
4/23/16, 03:28 - Cindy L: I was thinking peristalsis
4/23/16, 05:07 - Mom: how's ur poop now? frequency? texture?
4/23/16, 05:19 - Cindy L: Bone dry
4/23/16, 05:20 - Cindy L: Just had a scary dream abt robots
4/23/16, 05:20 - Cindy L: And the apocalypse
4/23/16, 05:52 - Mom: u have only slept for 2 hrs
4/23/16, 05:53 - Mom: when is ur poop in good shape? what food u ate for the time?
4/23/16, 06:00 - Mom: u had dream abt those robots b4?
4/23/16, 06:33 - Mom: do u still exercise for the past months?
4/23/16, 09:08 - Cindy L: Er normal food like pasta, drank juice, coffee, cakes, that stuff. I was joking when I said my poo was bone dry, lol
4/23/16, 09:08 - Cindy L: No.
4/23/16, 09:08 - Cindy L: No.
4/23/16, 09:09 - Cindy L: Haven't exercised in ages. Unless u count walking to the library
4/23/16, 09:09 - Mom: Sigh....
4/23/16, 09:10 - Cindy L: I forgot abt the dream already until I read the text
4/23/16, 09:11 - Cindy L: I remember waking up thinking that I should go hide in the toilet because a robot which looks like me was gonna come and replace me, hahaha üòÇ
4/23/16, 09:12 - Cindy L: And then I realised my room did not hv a toilet, so I must be dreaming.
4/23/16, 09:32 - Mom: does it mean ur kidney is having prob?
4/23/16, 09:33 - Mom: u know exercise can help regenerate nerve cells
4/23/16, 11:19 - Cindy L: No problemo with kidneys, why?
4/23/16, 11:19 - Cindy L: Yea but I needa study
4/23/16, 11:30 - Mom: it's just possible interpretation of dream
4/23/16, 11:31 - Mom: anyway, can i confirm that if u don't eat anything, u won't go into rem sleep or hallucination or shaking?
4/23/16, 11:32 - Mom: above things only happen after eating?
4/23/16, 12:20 - Cindy L: Yea
4/23/16, 12:45 - Cindy L: Mopps so kings's cross urbanest is the cheapest urbanest offer
4/23/16, 12:52 - Cindy L: Oh no I need a guarantor
4/23/16, 12:52 - Cindy L: I can't even see how much deposit is.....
4/23/16, 12:57 - Mom: no tenancy agreement?
4/23/16, 12:57 - Mom: what time u need to reply?
4/23/16, 12:58 - Mom: so, all symptoms r GI tract related?
4/23/16, 13:00 - Mom: one more thing, urbanest says in their website that if ur from other university, u'll be charged standard rates?
4/23/16, 13:38 - Cindy L: Like today
4/23/16, 13:38 - Cindy L: Oh
4/23/16, 13:38 - Cindy L: Then
4/23/16, 13:38 - Cindy L: Nvm
4/23/16, 13:42 - Cindy L: Remember rem CA. Be triggered as a reflex
4/23/16, 13:42 - Cindy L: Can be
4/23/16, 13:43 - Cindy L: Like a reflex
4/23/16, 13:43 - Cindy L: Possibly that's why morning rems don't seem to be related to nighttime sleep
4/23/16, 13:47 - Mom: what do u mean by ur last statement at 1343?
4/23/16, 13:47 - Cindy L: <Media omitted>
4/23/16, 13:49 - Cindy L: If I don't get enough sleep at night ( aka wake up tired), I tend to be more prone to enter rem in the day time. This makes sense
4/23/16, 13:50 - Cindy L: However, if I do get enough sleep at night ( aka wake up well rested) I still enter rem in the daytime quite frequently.
4/23/16, 13:50 - Cindy L: Even if I sleep 12+ hrs at night, daytime rem occurence does not seem to decline.
4/23/16, 13:51 - Cindy L: Also, I keep thinking back to my friend's dog, which went into seizures when it ate normal meals.
4/23/16, 13:52 - Cindy L: Suspect similar thing happening there. As epileptic seizures r linked to the rem state as well.
4/23/16, 13:52 - Cindy L: Anyways, they had to feed it less after taking it to the vet.
4/23/16, 13:53 - Mom: ur not dog!!!
4/23/16, 13:54 - Cindy L: Yea but we can only experiment on dogs and cats right.
4/23/16, 13:54 - Mom: what makes ur rem a reflex?
4/23/16, 13:54 - Cindy L: Happens after eating
4/23/16, 13:54 - Cindy L: Everytime.
4/23/16, 13:54 - Cindy L: I had avocado and egg this morning and then I fell asleep
4/23/16, 13:55 - Mom: that means ur body is expecting a rem after the first rem incident
4/23/16, 13:56 - Mom: but sleep duration same every time after eating?
4/23/16, 13:57 - Cindy L: Yes abt 15-20 mins
4/23/16, 13:57 - Cindy L: Maybe even less
4/23/16, 13:57 - Cindy L: What do u mean by expecting rem after first rem incident?
4/23/16, 13:58 - Mom: bc the theory says it's a reflex
4/23/16, 13:58 - Mom: then there must be the first time and then make the rest a reflex, but how?
4/23/16, 13:59 - Cindy L: Probably due to loss of some innate inhibitot
4/23/16, 13:59 - Cindy L: Inhibitor
4/23/16, 13:59 - Cindy L: Of that reflex
4/23/16, 14:00 - Cindy L: Some neurotransmitter or neurons
4/23/16, 14:00 - Cindy L: Not sure if orexin is an inhibitor
4/23/16, 14:01 - Cindy L: But Im pretty certain something went wrong in my hypothalamus
4/23/16, 14:01 - Cindy L: Still trying to figure out why
4/23/16, 14:02 - Cindy L: Which reminds me
4/23/16, 14:03 - Mom: reminds u what?
4/23/16, 14:04 - Cindy L: I read something abt acupuncture yesterday
4/23/16, 14:04 - Mom: any insight?
4/23/16, 14:04 - Cindy L: <Media omitted>
4/23/16, 14:05 - Cindy L: Oh yea I remember
4/23/16, 14:05 - Cindy L: U rmb that place in the back of my neck which I found pressing to help me recover from weakness more quickly
4/23/16, 14:07 - Cindy L: <Media omitted>
4/23/16, 14:08 - Cindy L: However I don't understand why everything seems to happen the opposite way for me.
4/23/16, 14:09 - Cindy L: Such as simulation of the vns should increase my cataplectic symptoms.
4/23/16, 14:09 - Cindy L: Strange
4/23/16, 14:10 - Cindy L: Maybe I can try the opposite drug.
4/23/16, 14:10 - Cindy L: Lol
4/23/16, 14:11 - Mom: i just have another thinking
4/23/16, 14:11 - Mom: ur rem after eating shudn't be reflex cuz u can control those incidents by not eating, which means they r voluntary response not involuntary
4/23/16, 14:12 - Mom: i think the case happened like this:
4/23/16, 14:12 - Mom: 1.  u eat something
4/23/16, 14:13 - Mom: 2.  ur body tells the brain u've something/process for digestion through ur vagus nerve
4/23/16, 14:13 - Mom: 3.  initiate those rem response
4/23/16, 14:14 - Cindy L: This is why I said the trigger might be peristalsis
4/23/16, 14:14 - Mom: still unsure but possible
4/23/16, 14:15 - Cindy L: Seems to make sense as its a delayed response
4/23/16, 14:15 - Mom: why u said stimulation of vn wud increase ur cataplectic response?
4/23/16, 14:15 - Cindy L: Decrease
4/23/16, 14:15 - Cindy L: Stimulation decreases it I said
4/23/16, 14:15 - Mom: so speed up ur recovery?
4/23/16, 14:16 - Cindy L: Yes
4/23/16, 14:16 - Cindy L: But theoretically supposed to increase right?
4/23/16, 14:16 - Cindy L: Cuz it triggers the psns
4/23/16, 14:17 - Mom: why trigger pns not sns?
4/23/16, 14:18 - Mom: vn affects sns, pns, ans
4/23/16, 14:22 - Cindy L: Parasympathetic system that's the one I'm referring to
4/23/16, 14:23 - Cindy L: There's two SNS, so this one can be called psns
4/23/16, 14:33 - Mom: i know what ur referring to but my Q is why pns or sns? they have opposite effect
4/23/16, 14:35 - Mom: i advise u to do one more time mri scan with contrast to see if there's any blood cloth or abnormality which can't be detected without contrast scan
4/23/16, 15:42 - Cindy L: Ok
4/23/16, 16:52 - Cindy L: Forgot to mention exercise still makes me sleep
4/23/16, 16:53 - Cindy L: Afterwards
4/23/16, 17:22 - Mom: bc u don't have enough energy ma
4/23/16, 17:22 - Mom: even swimming?
4/23/16, 17:24 - Mom: but this is weird as doc usually recommend pp to do exercise to improve neurotransmitters' balance
4/23/16, 18:29 - Mom: how many times do u eat?
4/23/16, 18:30 - Mom: if u eats 3 meals a day, i advise u to change it to 2 meals a day with them separate by at least 6 hrs
4/23/16, 18:31 - Mom: and for dinner, u can eat more carbohydrates to see if this wud help relieve daytime sleepiness
4/23/16, 18:42 - Cindy L: I already cut down to two meals a day
4/23/16, 18:42 - Cindy L: I snack in between cuz snacks seem to be fine, Im not sure.
4/23/16, 18:43 - Cindy L: I either eat breakfast and sleep once after
4/23/16, 18:43 - Cindy L: Or skip until dinner
4/23/16, 18:44 - Cindy L: Lunch is no good, cuz I just sleep through the afternoon
4/23/16, 18:46 - Mom: if u eat snack, u don't sleep?
4/23/16, 18:46 - Mom: what snack u usually have.
4/23/16, 18:51 - Cindy L: Snack? Erm like
4/23/16, 18:51 - Cindy L: I just had half a pack of chips
4/23/16, 18:51 - Cindy L: A pandan cakr
4/23/16, 18:51 - Cindy L: Cake
4/23/16, 18:52 - Cindy L: A small bar of dark chocolate
4/23/16, 18:52 - Cindy L: I didn't eat all of this today
4/23/16, 18:52 - Cindy L: Ok
4/23/16, 18:52 - Cindy L: Im just suggesting what I had as snacks before
4/23/16, 18:52 - Cindy L: A few biscuits
4/23/16, 22:55 - Cindy L: <Media omitted>
4/23/16, 22:55 - Cindy L: Found direct link between optic nerve and hypothalamus
4/24/16, 02:05 - Mom: i'm asking if u eat snack, will u sleep/nap like after meals?
4/24/16, 02:32 - Cindy L: Not sure. I did nap a bit during the afternoon today
4/24/16, 02:32 - Cindy L: Will try fasting tmr
4/24/16, 02:51 - Mom: and if u only drink like water, green tea, coffee... will u also nap afterwards?
4/24/16, 02:52 - Cindy L: No drink seems fine
4/24/16, 02:52 - Cindy L: No, drinks are fine
4/24/16, 02:52 - Mom: ei ya, almost 0300 am, sleep la
4/24/16, 23:38 - Cindy L: Oh wow
4/24/16, 23:39 - Cindy L: Northwestern admitted 45% of its class of 2018 during ed
4/24/16, 23:39 - Cindy L: No chance then. Hahaha
4/24/16, 23:39 - Cindy L: No wonder Rosanne got rejected so quickly as well
4/24/16, 23:40 - Cindy L: Just go to ucl for me then
4/24/16, 23:54 - Mom: U shud go to 2019?
4/24/16, 23:55 - Mom: During what?
4/25/16, 00:02 - Cindy L: No transfer is into 2nd yr
4/25/16, 00:12 - Mom: sigh....
4/25/16, 00:14 - Mom: ru going to try at the end of ur first yr during summer?
4/25/16, 00:46 - Cindy L: No
4/25/16, 00:46 - Cindy L: Why
4/25/16, 00:47 - Cindy L: I meant when I applied now I'm supposed to transfer into 2nd year of class of 2018 if I get accepted
4/25/16, 00:49 - Cindy L: Anyhoe
4/25/16, 00:49 - Cindy L: I tried the adrafinil again, under controlled conditions
4/25/16, 00:50 - Cindy L: I think it works, make me more alert
4/25/16, 00:50 - Cindy L: Not alert, like more 'awake'
4/25/16, 00:50 - Cindy L: It's not exactly a stimulant
4/25/16, 00:50 - Cindy L: However I'm prone to falling into microsleep even on modafinil
4/25/16, 00:51 - Cindy L: But frequency of sleep times did decrease
4/25/16, 01:35 - Mom: u shud go 2nd yr of 2019 ah
4/25/16, 01:35 - Mom: Any other side effect?
4/25/16, 01:37 - Mom: What microsleep?
4/25/16, 01:38 - Cindy L: Wait oh right
4/25/16, 01:39 - Cindy L: US is 4 year
4/25/16, 01:39 - Mom: üòì
4/25/16, 01:39 - Cindy L: Woe then Janet was very lucky
4/25/16, 01:39 - Cindy L: U know how I fall asleep involuntarily
4/25/16, 01:40 - Cindy L: Microsleep as in I do that for like a few seconds
4/25/16, 01:40 - Cindy L: I know I suddenly fall asleep cuz I can't write propwrly
4/25/16, 01:40 - Cindy L: Properly
4/25/16, 01:40 - Mom: Do u realize?
4/25/16, 01:41 - Cindy L: Realize that Im falling asleep?
4/25/16, 01:41 - Cindy L: Yea when I can't write properly
4/25/16, 01:41 - Mom: Yea
4/25/16, 01:41 - Cindy L: Not sure if I do so normally
4/25/16, 01:41 - Cindy L: I only know from cues
4/25/16, 01:42 - Mom: Microsleep is when u fell into sleep not knowing but still carrying on what ur doing
4/25/16, 01:43 - Cindy L: Yea
4/25/16, 01:43 - Cindy L: It's like that
4/25/16, 01:44 - Cindy L: Except I can't write when I do so
4/25/16, 01:44 - Cindy L: Hai why am I studying so hard.
4/25/16, 01:46 - Mom: I don't exactly know if a person in microsleep can write or not, but if he's driving he shud be doing that without notice
4/25/16, 01:48 - Mom: How often is ur "microsleep"?
4/25/16, 02:17 - Mom: when ur in  adrafinil, did u nap/nodding off after meals?
4/25/16, 02:22 - Cindy L: Yea
4/25/16, 02:22 - Mom: still?
4/25/16, 02:24 - Mom: how do u compare the energy level// awake state of taking adrafinil with that of L-carnitine?
4/25/16, 02:25 - Cindy L: Adrafinil last a lot longer
4/25/16, 02:25 - Cindy L: Cuz modafinil has 15 hr half life
4/25/16, 02:25 - Mom: and ur awake for the whole day?
4/25/16, 02:26 - Cindy L: Pretty much
4/25/16, 02:26 - Cindy L: Takes a while around 2hr to metabolize first
4/25/16, 02:26 - Mom: u said u had microsleep? how ofter is it? once? twice? thrice? in a day?
4/25/16, 02:27 - Cindy L: Dunno can't say, quite freq in beginning after lunch nap
4/25/16, 02:28 - Mom: then those microsleeps went away after some time?
4/25/16, 02:28 - Cindy L: Yea
4/25/16, 02:29 - Cindy L: I assume thats when it started workibg
4/25/16, 02:29 - Cindy L: I managed to stay awake to do shit tons of math
4/25/16, 02:29 - Mom: no other weird stuff happened so far? like hallucination? trembling?
4/25/16, 02:29 - Cindy L: Painful ~~
4/25/16, 02:29 - Cindy L: No
4/25/16, 02:29 - Cindy L: Oh
4/25/16, 02:30 - Mom: painful abt maths?
4/25/16, 02:30 - Cindy L: Really tired in the beginning
4/25/16, 02:30 - Cindy L: Yea
4/25/16, 02:30 - Cindy L: Like eyes were really tires
4/25/16, 02:30 - Cindy L: Tired
4/25/16, 02:30 - Cindy L: Kinda like on ACH
4/25/16, 02:30 - Mom: ic
4/25/16, 02:30 - Cindy L: I suspect my system is originally really tired.
4/25/16, 02:30 - Mom: ofc la
4/25/16, 02:31 - Cindy L: As a 'awakening drug' it works
4/25/16, 02:31 - Cindy L: But not really stimulation
4/25/16, 02:31 - Mom: still alert now?
4/25/16, 02:31 - Cindy L: Just keeps u awake.
4/25/16, 02:31 - Cindy L: Now
4/25/16, 02:31 - Cindy L: I'm still alert for other reasons.
4/25/16, 02:32 - Mom: i'm afraid u can't sleep well tonight
4/25/16, 02:32 - Cindy L: That's why I just drank a bottle of sake
4/25/16, 02:32 - Mom: cuz it seems ur still so alert
4/25/16, 02:32 - Mom: come on, quit that thing la
4/25/16, 02:32 - Cindy L: SNS activated
4/25/16, 02:32 - Cindy L: I want to punch some stuff
4/25/16, 02:32 - Mom: u want ur liver gone?
4/25/16, 02:32 - Mom: ur too hyper now?
4/25/16, 02:33 - Cindy L: U know one glass a day is good for u
4/25/16, 02:33 - Cindy L: A bottle of sake is really small.
4/25/16, 02:33 - Mom: .....
4/25/16, 02:33 - Mom: one bottle?
4/25/16, 02:34 - Cindy L: 250ml
4/25/16, 02:34 - Mom: ppl says one glass is good not one bottle
4/25/16, 02:34 - Cindy L: 250 is a glass lah
4/25/16, 02:34 - Mom: 250ml everyday is too much
4/25/16, 02:34 - Mom: ......
4/25/16, 02:34 - Cindy L: Same size as a vita soy milk
4/25/16, 02:34 - Mom: what do u think ur drinking?
4/25/16, 02:35 - Mom: vita soy milk is different from sake
4/25/16, 02:35 - Cindy L: Sake?
4/25/16, 02:35 - Cindy L: It's not soju
4/25/16, 02:35 - Mom: 250ml everyday is too much
4/25/16, 02:35 - Cindy L: I don't drink 250ml everyday
4/25/16, 02:35 - Cindy L: I'm not made of gold
4/25/16, 02:35 - Cindy L: Did u know soju is 20%
4/25/16, 02:36 - Cindy L: üòß
4/25/16, 02:36 - Cindy L: Yoyoyo
4/25/16, 02:36 - Cindy L: Question time
4/25/16, 02:37 - Mom: Sake is generally between 15% and 17% alcohol.
4/25/16, 02:37 - Cindy L: OK the bottle I had is sparkling girly shit
4/25/16, 02:37 - Cindy L: It's 7%
4/25/16, 02:38 - Mom: where it said 7%?
4/25/16, 02:38 - Cindy L: On the bottle lah
4/25/16, 02:38 - Mom: the wiki says it's 15-17%
4/25/16, 02:38 - Cindy L: R u telling the bottle is lying
4/25/16, 02:38 - Mom: it's diluted?
4/25/16, 02:38 - Cindy L: When the people who brew that shit stuck it on
4/25/16, 02:39 - Cindy L: Yea with carbonated water
4/25/16, 02:39 - Cindy L: It's sparkling
4/25/16, 02:39 - Mom: okok
4/25/16, 02:39 - Mom: u win
4/25/16, 02:39 - Cindy L: Hahahahaha
4/25/16, 02:40 - Cindy L: Also
4/25/16, 02:40 - Cindy L: Alcohol works on gaba a
4/25/16, 02:41 - Cindy L: Ghb (aka sodium oxybate) and l theanine works on gaba b
4/25/16, 02:41 - Cindy L: Which I suspect t maybe why they haven't been so effective.
4/25/16, 02:41 - Mom: u shud go eat something, then u can fall asleep quickly
4/25/16, 02:42 - Cindy L: Kk
4/25/16, 02:42 - Cindy L: Also before I forget
4/25/16, 02:42 - Cindy L: I was looking at sedatives yesterday
4/25/16, 02:43 - Mom: why look for sedatives?
4/25/16, 02:43 - Mom: not having enough sleep?
4/25/16, 02:43 - Cindy L: It was on the bottom of the wiki page
4/25/16, 02:43 - Cindy L: They had a nice table
4/25/16, 02:43 - Cindy L: Turns out antihistamines and tricyclics work on the very same h1 receptor
4/25/16, 02:44 - Mom: so?
4/25/16, 02:44 - Cindy L: Antihistamines r less dangerous ah
4/25/16, 02:45 - Cindy L: Ofc u would also have to also take a complementary serotonin reuptake inhibitor
4/25/16, 02:45 - Mom: they're stuff having opposite effect, u know/
4/25/16, 02:45 - Cindy L: There's something called an inverse agonist
4/25/16, 02:45 - Cindy L: Drugs which have negative effects on the same receptors for some reason
4/25/16, 02:46 - Cindy L: I thought of all those questions when I was procrastinating yesterday
4/25/16, 02:47 - Mom: antihistamine makes u drowsy/sleepy
4/25/16, 02:50 - Cindy L: Also
4/25/16, 02:48 - Mom: and i was always wondering why u can do/read ur research abt neurosci/drugs stuff but not maths or govt stuff?
4/25/16, 02:48 - Mom: all i can think of is psychological impact?
4/25/16, 02:50 - Cindy L: No I only spend 30 mins reading neuro stuff
4/25/16, 02:51 - Cindy L: I can do math for 30 mins
4/25/16, 02:51 - Cindy L: Though
4/25/16, 02:51 - Cindy L: My memory has been pretty bad these days
4/25/16, 02:51 - Cindy L: It's like I can't really remember what I did yesterday
4/25/16, 02:52 - Mom: what have u done today?
4/25/16, 02:53 - Mom: u said "these days"? how many days? a week?
4/25/16, 02:54 - Mom: anyway, better take a rest first
4/25/16, 02:54 - Mom: it's almost 3 am
4/25/16, 02:56 - Cindy L: Like
4/25/16, 02:56 - Cindy L: It took me a moment to remember the maths I was doing yesterday
4/25/16, 02:57 - Mom: ok, take a rest first
4/25/16, 02:57 - Mom: tty in london's morning time
4/25/16, 03:17 - Cindy L: I can't sleep
4/25/16, 03:17 - Cindy L: I'm so angry
4/25/16, 03:17 - Cindy L: It's the amygdala rage
4/25/16, 03:17 - Cindy L: I can't turn it off.
4/25/16, 03:33 - Mom: it's the side effect
4/25/16, 03:33 - Mom: ur too hyper
4/25/16, 03:33 - Mom: listen to music la
4/25/16, 03:33 - Mom: i'm afraid u'll be tired as hell tmr
4/25/16, 05:55 - Cindy L: I just slept for two hrs
4/25/16, 05:55 - Cindy L: And
4/25/16, 05:55 - Cindy L: I still have a lot of adrenaline
4/25/16, 05:56 - Cindy L: I still feel like u could really strangle someone to deatg
4/25/16, 05:56 - Cindy L: Death
4/25/16, 05:56 - Cindy L: I'm not joking cuz my SNS is on fire
4/25/16, 06:28 - Cindy L: Urgh
4/25/16, 06:28 - Cindy L: I already tried listening to music.
4/25/16, 06:28 - Cindy L: Slow jazz too
4/25/16, 06:28 - Cindy L: And deep breathing
4/25/16, 06:29 - Cindy L: Yeah I'll crash probably crash today
4/25/16, 06:30 - Cindy L: Should have took the adrafinil early in the morning.
4/25/16, 06:30 - Mom: this is what i've been worrying so far!!!
4/25/16, 06:30 - Mom: be careful today
4/25/16, 06:30 - Cindy L: Yeah but I also hv too much adrenaline right now
4/25/16, 06:31 - Mom: i just wonder if ur sleep prob starts from where?
4/25/16, 06:32 - Mom: cuz it's not logical that those drug always has a strong or opposite effect on u
4/25/16, 06:32 - Cindy L: Well I dunno, I did just sleep for two hrs
4/25/16, 06:32 - Cindy L: So the modafinil work or not?
4/25/16, 06:32 - Mom: work too much
4/25/16, 06:32 - Cindy L: It has 15 hr half life so I'd expect it to take 30 hrs for effects to wear off
4/25/16, 06:33 - Mom: it's like working on individual for him/her to continue work/study for days without stop
4/25/16, 06:33 - Mom: and u got this result
4/25/16, 06:34 - Cindy L: Sort of lah
4/25/16, 06:34 - Cindy L: But it just keeps u awake
4/25/16, 06:34 - Mom: i'm worried that ur cataplexy wud be worsen so much the days after
4/25/16, 06:34 - Mom: can't focus on doing work?
4/25/16, 06:35 - Cindy L: U still feel tired
4/25/16, 06:35 - Cindy L: No I hv amazing focus, never procrastinate, going on fb and YouTube and shit
4/25/16, 06:36 - Cindy L: But normally I'm quite focused too
4/25/16, 06:36 - Cindy L: I think the excess adrenaline feels worse right now....
4/25/16, 06:37 - Cindy L: Ugh I'm gonna need to gym this off
4/25/16, 06:37 - Mom: so when the drug wear out, i'm afraid u'll get totally adrenaline fatigue cuz ur adrenaline might be used too much
4/25/16, 06:37 - Mom: any increase in HR or BP?
4/25/16, 06:38 - Cindy L: Yea both cuz adrenaline
4/25/16, 06:38 - Mom: sigh....
4/25/16, 06:38 - Mom: one day awake, one week tired to dead!!!
4/25/16, 06:39 - Mom: this is the drawback of those drugs
4/25/16, 06:39 - Cindy L: The adrenaline was caused by external eevent though
4/25/16, 06:39 - Cindy L: I see
4/25/16, 06:39 - Mom: what external event?
4/25/16, 06:39 - Mom: who made u so annoying?
4/25/16, 06:39 - Cindy L: Annoying people on the street
4/25/16, 06:39 - Mom: what?
4/25/16, 06:40 - Mom: why bother them?
4/25/16, 06:40 - Mom: they're just nobody
4/25/16, 06:40 - Cindy L: London is annoying like that, random people come up to harass u
4/25/16, 06:41 - Cindy L: I know they r nobody,  but they follow u and keep bugging u what can u do
4/25/16, 06:41 - Mom: u've been harassed by some unknown persons?
4/25/16, 06:41 - Mom: r they beggars?
4/25/16, 06:41 - Cindy L: Huh nearly everyone I know has been harassed by some weird people on the street
4/25/16, 06:42 - Mom: r they trying to steal things from u or whatever?
4/25/16, 06:42 - Cindy L: No sometimes strange people just come up and talk to you.
4/25/16, 06:42 - Cindy L: Dunno
4/25/16, 06:42 - Mom: sex harassment?
4/25/16, 06:42 - Cindy L: If stealing things then bump into u lah
4/25/16, 06:42 - Cindy L: I dunno probably maybe.
4/25/16, 06:43 - Cindy L: No even my guy friends have had these experiences
4/25/16, 06:43 - Mom: better go with friends
4/25/16, 06:43 - Mom: and don't stay late on the street
4/25/16, 06:43 - Cindy L: Anyways
4/25/16, 06:44 - Cindy L: It doesn't take much for me to go into fight vs flight
4/25/16, 06:44 - Cindy L: Hence the adrenaline buildup
4/25/16, 06:45 - Mom: u've so much adrenaline?
4/25/16, 06:45 - Cindy L: Like u've seen me get crazy angry right
4/25/16, 06:45 - Cindy L: It's like I blew a fuse
4/25/16, 06:45 - Mom: that's why u got adrenaline fatigue???
4/25/16, 06:46 - Mom: go to meditation la
4/25/16, 06:46 - Mom: it helps regulate ur emotion
4/25/16, 06:46 - Cindy L: I already did deep breathing
4/25/16, 06:47 - Cindy L: I still woke up wanting to strangle someone to death
4/25/16, 06:47 - Mom: well, i nvr know ur so impulsive person
4/25/16, 06:48 - Mom: do some productive things like do ur maths
4/25/16, 06:49 - Cindy L: Hahaha
4/25/16, 06:49 - Mom: isn't it a good idea?
4/25/16, 06:50 - Cindy L: Other than that, If not for the adrenaline, it's mostly like ACH
4/25/16, 06:50 - Cindy L: But better
4/25/16, 06:50 - Cindy L: And lasts longee
4/25/16, 06:50 - Cindy L: But still need to sleep after eating.
4/25/16, 06:51 - Cindy L: Post meal naps are abt 45 min long
4/25/16, 06:51 - Mom: this is the weirdest thing cuz u shud be normal after modafinil right?
4/25/16, 06:51 - Cindy L: Don't understand
4/25/16, 06:52 - Cindy L: Why?
4/25/16, 06:52 - Mom: i mean do narcoleptics sleep after meals?
4/25/16, 06:52 - Mom: is this a symptom of narcolepsy?
4/25/16, 06:52 - Cindy L: No, I don't know
4/25/16, 06:53 - Mom: narco says daytime sleep attacks but is nap after meal every time considered as normal sleep attack?
4/25/16, 06:53 - Mom: this is weird
4/25/16, 06:54 - Mom: and the researches seem didn't mention sleep after meals prob particularly
4/25/16, 06:54 - Mom: even ppl suffering from narco never have mentioned this thing on the forum
4/25/16, 06:55 - Mom: if my hypothesis is right, ur sleep probs after meal don't relate to that of narco???
4/25/16, 08:30 - Cindy L: Okay....
4/25/16, 08:31 - Cindy L: Thats because if u eat too many carbs u feel a bit sleepy
4/25/16, 08:31 - Cindy L: People call that a food coma
4/25/16, 08:31 - Cindy L: But they don't involuntarily fall asleep
4/25/16, 08:38 - Mom: but did u rlly eat tooo much carbs???
4/25/16, 08:38 - Cindy L: No I'm saying that for normal people
4/25/16, 08:39 - Cindy L: Cuz that happens when I just hv meat too
4/25/16, 08:40 - Mom: i wud say its rather ur serotonin in Q, but i dunno if too much or deficiency?
4/25/16, 08:40 - Cindy L: Why
4/25/16, 08:41 - Mom: u know abt 80-90% of the serotonin is in ur gut, and when process pass through ur gut into intestine, serotonin is involved in this process
4/25/16, 08:41 - Cindy L: I see
4/25/16, 08:42 - Cindy L: Fair point
4/25/16, 08:45 - Mom: u said adrafinil is effective on ur alertness, it has direct action in ur brain
4/25/16, 08:45 - Cindy L: Yea modafinil crosses the bbb
4/25/16, 08:45 - Mom: but u still nap for so long time after lunch, isn't this mean that ur sleeping prob after meal is caused by digestion, not ur brain?
4/25/16, 08:46 - Cindy L: Yes somehow the GI tract can override cns
4/25/16, 08:46 - Cindy L: Unless the adrafinil didn't actually work
4/25/16, 08:46 - Mom: u think so?
4/25/16, 08:47 - Cindy L: I don't know
4/25/16, 08:47 - Cindy L: Need more data
4/25/16, 08:47 - Mom: me neither, i guess it's probably the serotonin which affects ur digestion, body temp, mood and.....
4/25/16, 08:48 - Cindy L: Hurr
4/25/16, 08:48 - Mom: looks like ur gut is intiating a signal to ur brain to tell ur body to sleep?
4/25/16, 08:48 - Cindy L: yea
4/25/16, 08:48 - Mom: am i reasonable?
4/25/16, 08:49 - Cindy L: And the inhibitor of this signal has disappeared
4/25/16, 08:49 - Mom: probably??
4/25/16, 08:49 - Mom: i was thinking so
4/25/16, 08:49 - Mom: u tried 5htp b4?
4/25/16, 08:49 - Mom: u can sleep well after that?
4/25/16, 08:50 - Cindy L: So in the end, it's neuromodulation of 5ht, and norepinephrine
4/25/16, 08:50 - Cindy L: Hahaha
4/25/16, 08:50 - Cindy L: We went a full circle
4/25/16, 08:52 - Mom: i've been reading abt the neurotransmitters preciously these days, and according to ur response, what i can guess is the serotonin, but i still don't understand it's under or over-react?
4/25/16, 08:53 - Mom: according to ur reaction to those drugs/supplements, i don't rlly convinced it's ur brain having prob???
4/25/16, 08:53 - Mom: ur brain however is just reacting to those drugs
4/25/16, 08:59 - Cindy L: ,....
4/25/16, 09:14 - Mom: maybe, u can try to eat more carbs instead of meat cuz meat contains more tryptophan which is precursor of 5 htp
4/25/16, 09:15 - Mom: ur serotonin level indeed has increased due to consumption of meat
4/25/16, 09:16 - Mom: just try the difference on nap time after eating carbs and meats
4/25/16, 09:31 - Cindy L: Interesting
4/25/16, 09:31 - Mom: what interesting?
4/25/16, 09:32 - Cindy L: The serotonin

4/26/16, 13:34 - Cindy L: I checked for it to be hallucination u need to be aware that it is not real at the time.
4/26/16, 13:35 - Cindy L: But with dreams u hv no awareness of this.
4/26/16, 13:41 - Mom: but ur dream yesterday was rlly freaking ah
4/26/16, 14:46 - Cindy L: I guess.
4/26/16, 14:46 - Cindy L: I dunno I have so many weird dreams I'm sort of used to it.
4/26/16, 14:48 - Cindy L: I'm a bit worried abt my eye
4/26/16, 14:48 - Cindy L: There's clearly pressure applied on it when I laugh too much.
4/26/16, 14:49 - Cindy L: Esp the right one.
4/26/16, 14:49 - Cindy L: I don't want to wake up blind suddenly one day.
4/26/16, 14:54 - Mom: how can i help now?
4/26/16, 14:54 - Mom: isn't it the pressure on ur optic nerve?
4/26/16, 14:56 - Cindy L: Yea
4/26/16, 14:56 - Cindy L: Remember I sent u the diagram of the optic chiasm
4/26/16, 14:56 - Cindy L: The optic chiasm sits directly underneath the hypothalamus
4/26/16, 14:57 - Mom: i know
4/26/16, 14:57 - Cindy L: Shiiiit
4/26/16, 14:57 - Cindy L: Real shit.
4/26/16, 14:57 - Mom: what?
4/26/16, 14:57 - Cindy L: I cannot go blind.
4/26/16, 14:58 - Cindy L: Im a visually oriented person.
4/26/16, 14:58 - Cindy L: üòü
4/26/16, 14:59 - Mom: go to nhs and get a check on ur eye muscles la
4/26/16, 14:59 - Cindy L: Yea
4/26/16, 14:59 - Mom: if u said pressure on ur eyes, it shud be the muscles instead of the optic nerve right?
4/26/16, 14:59 - Cindy L: It's not muscle, it's the nerve
4/26/16, 15:00 - Mom: pain?
4/26/16, 15:00 - Cindy L: Whenever I laugh a lot I can feel this pressure buildup inside my head
4/26/16, 15:00 - Cindy L: It feels like my eye is bulging
4/26/16, 15:01 - Cindy L: And wants to pop out of the socket.
4/26/16, 15:01 - Cindy L: But not that extreme
4/26/16, 15:01 - Mom: for hyperthyroidism, eyes wud be bulging
4/26/16, 15:01 - Cindy L: That's both eyes
4/26/16, 15:02 - Cindy L: It's only my right one
4/26/16, 15:02 - Cindy L: And it doesn't happen all the time.
4/26/16, 15:02 - Mom: go check at the nhs
4/26/16, 15:02 - Mom: quick
4/26/16, 15:03 - Mom: is there any facial nerve trembling when u laugh?
4/26/16, 15:09 - Cindy L: Yea
4/26/16, 15:11 - Mom: go check ur eyes first

4/26/16, 17:30 - Mom: üòë
4/26/16, 17:38 - Cindy L: <Media omitted>
4/26/16, 18:39 - Mom: what?

4/26/16, 18:39 - Mom: u'll hv to laugh alot?
4/26/16, 18:51 - Cindy L: I was sarcastic
4/26/16, 18:51 - Cindy L: Lol im so sad
4/26/16, 18:52 - Cindy L: There's like a dull ache in the back of my head when I'm sleepy
4/26/16, 18:56 - Mom: At the brain stem?
4/26/16, 18:59 - Mom: can u massage around that area to c if any improvements
4/26/16, 19:00 - Mom: headache happens just recently?
4/26/16, 19:22 - Cindy L: Not sure if it's an ache, like an uncomfortable feeling.
4/26/16, 19:22 - Cindy L: No it's like the whole back of the head
4/26/16, 19:24 - Mom: Get a pain reliever
4/26/16, 19:24 - Mom: Panadol
4/26/16, 19:25 - Mom: When did u hv period last time?
4/26/16, 19:25 - Mom: Perhaps hormonal effect?
4/26/16, 19:48 - Cindy L: I just slept for 20 mins
4/26/16, 19:48 - Cindy L: Very strange observation
4/26/16, 19:48 - Cindy L: My body temp has already lowered when I wake up
4/26/16, 19:49 - Cindy L: But I get hot during the night instead
4/26/16, 19:49 - Cindy L: ü§î
4/27/16, 00:53 - Mom: i think nap is different from night time sleep
4/27/16, 00:54 - Mom: cuz at night time, ur supposed to go through complete sleep cycles
4/27/16, 00:55 - Mom: therefore ur body temp maintenance mechanism will be initiated
4/27/16, 00:56 - Mom: u know, when ppl's brain temp increase, they're more prone to go into sleep state and vice versa
4/27/16, 00:57 - Mom: so, at mid-night when u feel hot, ur brain's temp has gone down that makes u awake
4/27/16, 00:59 - Mom: but this is supposed to happen at the end of ur sleep cycles in the morning?
4/27/16, 01:02 - Mom: it's ur circadian system being interrupted/changed, i suppose
4/27/16, 01:03 - Mom: but it's top-down or bottom-up?
4/27/16, 01:03 - Mom: dunno know?
4/27/16, 01:03 - Mom: but according to the research papers, ur brain can be trained
4/27/16, 01:04 - Mom: therefore, docs always tell ppl to maintain regular sleep schedule i.e. to train ur brain to that particular set of sleep time
4/27/16, 01:05 - Mom: sort of conditioning
4/27/16, 01:10 - Cindy L: No doctors tell ppl to maintain regular sleep schedule cuz they don't know what they're doing and that sort of advice sounds able right
4/27/16, 01:11 - Cindy L: About right
4/27/16, 01:11 - Cindy L: There's a specific way neuroconditioning works
4/27/16, 01:12 - Cindy L: Ur right that there is a mechanism which regulates the amount of sleep u get.
4/27/16, 01:13 - Cindy L: The body core temp lowers during sleep
4/27/16, 01:13 - Cindy L: Not increase.
4/27/16, 01:14 - Cindy L: Which is why I mentioned that it started lowering just 20 mins in is kind of strange
4/27/16, 02:08 - Cindy L: I feel like puking again.
4/27/16, 02:09 - Cindy L: Urghh
4/27/16, 02:13 - Mom: want to vomit?
4/27/16, 02:13 - Cindy L: Yea nausea
4/27/16, 02:14 - Mom: when start?
4/27/16, 02:14 - Cindy L: Just now.
4/27/16, 02:14 - Mom: headache?
4/27/16, 02:14 - Cindy L: I think I've been spending too much time with the guys next door.
4/27/16, 02:14 - Cindy L: They r disgusting
4/27/16, 02:14 - Mom: any headache?
4/27/16, 02:15 - Mom: don't joke
4/27/16, 02:15 - Mom: it's not good sign if accompanied with headache
4/27/16, 02:15 - Cindy L: I was thinking abt how disgusting they were and then I felt like puking.
4/27/16, 02:15 - Cindy L: I'm not joking that's how disgusting the average male here is.
4/27/16, 02:15 - Mom: not actual vomit feeling?
4/27/16, 02:16 - Cindy L: Nausea
4/27/16, 02:16 - Cindy L: U feel like u want to puke but u don't actually puke
4/27/16, 02:16 - Cindy L: Nausea
4/27/16, 02:17 - Mom: go sleep la
4/27/16, 02:17 - Mom: 0200 am
4/27/16, 02:17 - Cindy L: I would
4/27/16, 02:17 - Cindy L: If I was feeling like I want to puke.
4/27/16, 02:17 - Cindy L: I wasnt
4/27/16, 02:29 - Cindy L: Mopps
4/27/16, 02:29 - Cindy L: Don't ignore me üòû
4/27/16, 02:44 - Mom: ?
4/27/16, 02:46 - Mom: it looks like ur sleeping in daytime and becomes active at night time
4/27/16, 02:46 - Mom: this is not even polyphasic, but what's it called?
4/27/16, 02:47 - Mom: nocturnal?
4/27/16, 03:01 - Mom: üôÉ
4/27/16, 11:42 - Cindy L: Hahaha I think I could probably manage to sleep polyphasic if I wanted to.
4/27/16, 11:43 - Cindy L: I'm not sleeping that much during the day, only after meal times.
4/27/16, 11:44 - Cindy L: Lemme think, for polyphasic u sleep 6 times in 24 hrs so thats once every 4 hrs.
4/27/16, 12:19 - Mom: i know why u feel pressure on ur right eye when u laugh
4/27/16, 12:20 - Mom: bc ur body is trying to go into rem sleep
4/27/16, 12:46 - Mom: Ur rlly doing this?
4/27/16, 12:58 - Cindy L: The polyphasic sleeping? No
4/27/16, 12:58 - Cindy L: Way, jose
4/27/16, 12:58 - Cindy L: Definitely not during study period
4/27/16, 12:59 - Cindy L: U need nrem to move stuff from hippocampus to neocortex
4/27/16, 12:59 - Cindy L: Not sleeping would be kind of dumb
4/27/16, 12:59 - Cindy L: Why does my body going into rem put pressure on my right eye?
4/27/16, 13:00 - Cindy L: It definitely droops more. I just thought my eyelid was looser on that eye.
4/27/16, 13:02 - Mom: it's the oculomotor nerve in action when ppl go into rem
4/27/16, 13:02 - Mom: third cranial nerve controlling the eye movements
4/27/16, 13:03 - Cindy L: Oh I see
4/27/16, 13:03 - Cindy L: Why happen to only right eye leh?
4/27/16, 13:04 - Mom: at the beginning of rem sleep, the oculomotor nerve wud impact one eye only
4/27/16, 13:04 - Mom: and later, both eyes when complete transit into rem sleep state
4/27/16, 13:05 - Cindy L: I see
4/27/16, 13:06 - Mom: i have just read a paper abt this detailing the eeg on both eyes during awake, nrem, rem and transit from nrem into rem
4/27/16, 13:07 - Cindy L: Woe.
4/27/16, 13:07 - Cindy L: OK thanks.
4/27/16, 13:07 - Cindy L: Btw.
4/27/16, 13:08 - Cindy L: Can I change to an earlier flight back for emirate?
4/27/16, 13:08 - Mom: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1113/jphysiol.2008.153239/full
4/27/16, 13:08 - Mom: read this if ur interest but it's very technical and i can't understand very well
4/27/16, 13:08 - Mom: what date u want to change?
4/27/16, 13:09 - Mom: how abt ur usa visa to ucb?
4/27/16, 13:09 - Mom: get that in london or hk?
4/27/16, 13:10 - Cindy L: Er I think they will send the form here
4/27/16, 13:11 - Cindy L: I dunno how long it's going to take to get it here.
4/27/16, 13:11 - Mom: so do u have enough time to process ur visa at london?
4/27/16, 13:11 - Cindy L: Depends on when I get the i-20
4/27/16, 13:11 - Mom: abt 10 working days, i've checked
4/27/16, 13:11 - Cindy L: OK I see. Thats not too bad.
4/27/16, 13:11 - Cindy L: I can still get in HK if I get back early then.
4/27/16, 13:12 - Mom: i'm afraid ur time will be tight
4/27/16, 13:12 - Cindy L: Yea...
4/27/16, 13:12 - Cindy L: I also need to find housing.
4/27/16, 13:12 - Mom: better wait for ur 1-20 first and check with the us embassy if u can get ur f-1 visa there in london
4/27/16, 13:13 - Mom: before coming back to hk
4/27/16, 13:13 - Cindy L: Ah ok
4/27/16, 13:13 - Mom: if not, then u have to arrange that here in hk
4/27/16, 13:13 - Mom: but u still need to ask if u can do it in hk, not london
4/27/16, 13:13 - Cindy L: Yea.
4/27/16, 13:13 - Mom: btw, change emirates flight ticket is very easy
4/27/16, 13:14 - Mom: if there's seat, just 1 or 2 days can do
4/27/16, 13:14 - Cindy L: Oh OK good, I was afraid it would be super complicated again.
4/27/16, 13:14 - Mom: cuz ur coming back in early june, i think it wud be easy to get a seat
4/27/16, 13:15 - Mom: so the first thing have to settle down ur f-1 visa
4/27/16, 13:15 - Cindy L: I see
4/27/16, 13:15 - Mom: what complicated?
4/27/16, 13:15 - Cindy L: I should get the form in abt a week I think
4/27/16, 13:15 - Cindy L: Changing flights
4/27/16, 13:15 - Mom: no, super easy
4/27/16, 13:15 - Mom: just do it online in a min
4/27/16, 13:16 - Cindy L: And then there's housing.
4/27/16, 13:16 - Mom: yea, where to book ur housing in ucb?
4/27/16, 13:16 - Cindy L: They hv on campus housing
4/27/16, 13:17 - Mom: and i probably wud go with u, how's the housing be arranged?
4/27/16, 13:17 - Cindy L: But it's like really expensive.
4/27/16, 13:17 - Cindy L: And they hv apartments and stufd
4/27/16, 13:17 - Mom: campus housing? expensive?
4/27/16, 13:17 - Cindy L: Yeah more than London
4/27/16, 13:17 - Mom: can u apply the student housing?
4/27/16, 13:17 - Cindy L: But everything is provided
4/27/16, 13:18 - Cindy L: They hv meals all the time.
4/27/16, 13:18 - Mom: do u have the housing details?
4/27/16, 13:18 - Cindy L: If u go on the berkely summer sessions websitr
4/27/16, 13:18 - Cindy L: There's a housing page.

4/27/16, 13:20 - Cindy L: I don't think so, Berkeley is near San fran
4/27/16, 13:20 - Mom: u probably have to wait for long time for a turn
4/27/16, 13:20 - Cindy L: That's the city already
4/27/16, 13:20 - Mom: ok
4/27/16, 13:20 - Cindy L: Bike.

4/27/16, 13:21 - Cindy L: Kind of
4/27/16, 13:22 - Cindy L: I changed my diet to meal deals so yeah I think it counts.
4/27/16, 13:22 - Mom: sleep less or longer?
4/27/16, 13:22 - Mom: what's meal deals?
4/27/16, 13:22 - Mom: dollar meal?
4/27/16, 13:22 - Cindy L: The sandwich snack drink deal for 3.25pp
4/27/16, 13:23 - Mom: those papers said eat refine soft food, less veggie, less meat with tryptophan
4/27/16, 13:26 - Cindy L: Why less veg
4/27/16, 13:29 - Mom: difficult to digest
4/27/16, 13:30 - Cindy L: That's the point?
4/27/16, 13:30 - Cindy L: It's fibre?
4/27/16, 13:30 - Mom: did u find u poop dry even if u eat lots of veggie?
4/27/16, 13:30 - Cindy L: Yea
4/27/16, 13:31 - Mom: the paper said for hard food and veggie, they're difficult for the digestive tract to digest and they stimulate the cell there secrete more serontonin in the digestiion process
4/27/16, 13:32 - Cindy L: Right.
4/27/16, 13:32 - Mom: u can check ur poop to see if u changed to soft food and easy to poo and soft?
4/27/16, 13:33 - Cindy L: Ok
4/27/16, 16:53 - Cindy L: Omg I started watching the Yale lectures for poli theory
4/27/16, 16:53 - Cindy L: And they are sooo good
4/27/16, 16:55 - Cindy L: That sort of education is worth the monies
4/27/16, 17:02 - Mom: ai ya, u think yale is "fake"
4/27/16, 17:03 - Mom: i bet if u've been to ucb for summer courses, u don't want to go back to uk
4/27/16, 17:41 - Cindy L: Dude I see what Plato's point was now.
4/27/16, 17:41 - Cindy L: I know for certain I made the wrong choice now, I should hv went to Columbia.
4/27/16, 17:42 - Cindy L: Fuck.
4/27/16, 17:43 - Cindy L: Sniff.
4/27/16, 17:58 - Mom: üò≠üò≠

4/28/16, 12:08 - Cindy L: Lse is full of rude ppl what do u expect
4/28/16, 12:08 - Mom: did james wards ask u to wake up?
4/28/16, 12:09 - Cindy L: No it's like a mass lecture
4/28/16, 12:09 - Cindy L: He doesn't give a fuck if u sleep through every single one of them.
4/28/16, 12:09 - Mom: for australian lecturers, they definitely don't like ppl sleep in class
4/28/16, 12:10 - Mom: so can u do the integration?
4/28/16, 12:10 - Mom: didn't sleep after woke up?

4/28/16, 12:14 - Mom: what do u mean by know nothing abt now?
4/28/16, 12:14 - Mom: why the hell is there a mock exam?
4/28/16, 12:14 - Mom: so that u can redo the exam if results not good?
4/28/16, 12:14 - Cindy L: Cuz they hv an extra lesson and they didn't plan to do anything.
4/28/16, 12:15 - Mom: chi seen
4/28/16, 12:15 - Cindy L: It's not even recorded.
4/28/16, 12:15 - Cindy L: I know right.
4/28/16, 12:15 - Mom: what subject?
4/28/16, 12:15 - Cindy L: Yale lectures so good
4/28/16, 12:15 - Cindy L: Poli sci
4/28/16, 12:15 - Mom: all or just one particular sub?
4/28/16, 12:15 - Cindy L: Just that
4/28/16, 12:16 - Mom: so u can actually learn from that Yale's lecture notes?
4/28/16, 12:16 - Cindy L: Yeah, that's how u learn here as well
4/28/16, 12:16 - Cindy L: Political philosophy here is soooo bad.
4/28/16, 12:16 - Mom: i know there's a joint course between Yale and Singapore university
4/28/16, 12:16 - Cindy L: So I just switched to watching the yale lectures for those.
4/28/16, 12:17 - Cindy L: Yeah yeah
4/28/16, 12:17 - Cindy L: Don't really like Singaporeans tbh
4/28/16, 12:17 - Mom: sigh....
4/28/16, 12:17 - Mom: too much thing u wud dislike
4/28/16, 12:18 - Mom: tbh singaporeans r not rlly good
4/28/16, 12:19 - Mom: did u eat adrafinil?

4/28/16, 12:21 - Cindy L: Should hv done that
4/28/16, 12:21 - Cindy L: Or not.
4/28/16, 12:22 - Mom: u probably need that for ur exam
4/28/16, 12:22 - Cindy L: I remember there was a paper which reported that decerebrated kittens automatically went into rem when they listen to monotonous sounds.
4/28/16, 12:23 - Cindy L: James wards is pretty monotonous...
4/28/16, 12:24 - Mom: i rmb that u didn't sleep in one subj cuz that lecturer speaks fast
4/28/16, 12:24 - Mom: what's that subj?
4/28/16, 12:25 - Mom: poli sci?

4/28/16, 15:40 - Cindy L: I got an offer
4/28/16, 15:41 - Cindy L: I suspect getting in through transfer is easier than applying through yr 1
4/28/16, 15:42 - Cindy L: Cuz ur competitors r community college or other shrewd kids.
4/28/16, 15:49 - Mom: ur so fuuny
4/28/16, 15:50 - Mom: did u read the stat abt transfer application?
4/28/16, 15:51 - Mom: 1700+ applications, around 220 offered and half enrolled
4/28/16, 15:53 - Mom: community college kids usually apply for third yr
4/28/16, 15:55 - Cindy L: Oh yea.
4/28/16, 15:57 - Cindy L: Anyway
4/28/16, 15:57 - Cindy L: Now I'm in visa dooodoo

4/28/16, 23:01 - Cindy L: Even more than hk
4/28/16, 23:02 - Cindy L: I met another one today
4/28/16, 23:05 - Mom: üò©
4/28/16, 23:05 - Mom: Did u get hurt?
4/28/16, 23:30 - Cindy L: No I was with my friend at kfc
4/28/16, 23:31 - Cindy L: He came up to us and asked us if he could take a shit in a cup
4/28/16, 23:31 - Cindy L: My friend answered no, lol.
4/28/16, 23:31 - Cindy L: He asked again
4/28/16, 23:31 - Cindy L: No
4/28/16, 23:32 - Cindy L: And then he walked away, saying we were really rude.
4/28/16, 23:32 - Cindy L: What would be a good way to reaxt?
4/28/16, 23:32 - Cindy L: React?
4/28/16, 23:33 - Cindy L: ü§î
4/28/16, 23:34 - Cindy L: The table was fixed so no table flipping
4/28/16, 23:39 - Cindy L: This one is hard. I can't think of a way to cause maximum shame and social humiliation in a stranger.
4/28/16, 23:41 - Cindy L: How can I have the last laugh?
4/28/16, 23:41 - Cindy L: How I can be more crazy than a crazy?
4/28/16, 23:42 - Cindy L: ü§î
4/28/16, 23:47 - Cindy L: Oh!
4/28/16, 23:47 - Cindy L: I should have asked him if he voted for ukip
4/28/16, 23:47 - Cindy L: Hahahaha
4/28/16, 23:48 - Cindy L: And then launch into a pro China sermon in the middle of kfc to show how fucking shit his white country is doing
4/28/16, 23:48 - Cindy L: Hahahahaha
4/28/16, 23:49 - Cindy L: Ask if he has a job, obviously not why would he be going around shitting in people's cups then
4/28/16, 23:49 - Cindy L: Hahahahahha
4/28/16, 23:49 - Cindy L: Omg too much adrenal.
4/28/16, 23:49 - Cindy L: Adrenaline.
4/28/16, 23:50 - Cindy L: Do you think its better than screaming and calling him a pedophile pervert in the middle of kfc though?
4/29/16, 00:04 - Mom: What actually u guys did to him?
4/29/16, 00:04 - Mom: Nothing?
4/29/16, 00:22 - Cindy L: Nothing.
4/29/16, 00:22 - Cindy L: But since this is my third crazy in April
4/29/16, 00:23 - Cindy L: I thought I should prefer for them
4/29/16, 00:23 - Cindy L: Prepare
4/29/16, 00:28 - Mom: Just tell him to go away
4/29/16, 00:28 - Mom: That's enough or ignore him
4/29/16, 01:32 - Mom: so poor
4/29/16, 01:32 - Mom: even at the centre of london had this thing happened
4/29/16, 01:32 - Mom: what's wrong with uk?
4/29/16, 02:41 - Mom: https://selfhacked.com/2013/07/17/why-i-dont-supplement-with-piracetam/
4/29/16, 06:26 - Cindy L: Saaaaaaaa
4/29/16, 06:26 - Cindy L: What's wrong with the world
4/29/16, 06:27 - Cindy L: Cuz people r by nature assholes
4/29/16, 06:28 - Cindy L: I can quote a lot of people on that
4/29/16, 06:36 - Cindy L: OK looked at ur link
4/29/16, 06:37 - Cindy L: 1. These people r idiots, they are taking more than 1000mg dosages a couple of times on a day. I just saw someone take like up to 5g of this stuff
4/29/16, 06:38 - Cindy L: If u increase dosage so quickly ofc lah
4/29/16, 06:42 - Cindy L: 2. Not sure what they all mean by brain fog
4/29/16, 06:43 - Cindy L: Or whether it's similar to what I experience during rem attacks
4/29/16, 06:44 - Cindy L: 3. Im Guessing normal people can't support that much increase of ACH in their brain
4/29/16, 06:48 - Cindy L: 4. Also if these ppl r as healthy as they claim why the hell r they taking weird supplements from dodgy places
4/29/16, 06:56 - Cindy L: No. 34 gives a more detailed description. Sounds like me when I'm sleepy and try to work. In these cases j just go to sleep
4/29/16, 06:57 - Cindy L: But don't forget these things probably work opposite to intended effect on me.
4/29/16, 08:16 - Mom: They're taking that for experimental purpose
4/29/16, 08:17 - Mom: Waaaa, u've so much adrenaline!!!!
4/29/16, 08:36 - Mom: u met lots of assholes at london? or in hk?
4/29/16, 08:36 - Mom: or just in lse?
4/29/16, 08:37 - Mom: üòì
4/29/16, 08:49 - Mom: Where's the KFC in London?
4/29/16, 10:11 - Cindy L: Leister square
4/29/16, 10:12 - Cindy L: Camden has a lot of these retards
4/29/16, 10:14 - Cindy L: See point 1 and point 3. They taking on average 3x800mg per day
4/29/16, 10:14 - Cindy L: That's 2.4g
4/29/16, 10:14 - Cindy L: 2.4g
4/29/16, 10:14 - Cindy L: Ur not even supposed to take that much salt a day
4/29/16, 10:15 - Cindy L: Up to 5g is crazy
4/29/16, 10:16 - Cindy L: Probably too much acetylcholine causes that headaches and brain fog
4/29/16, 10:18 - Cindy L: When I have alcar it in the beginning, there is a slight period u feel extremely tired.
4/29/16, 10:37 - Mom: camden is like shamshuipo? tinshuiwai?
4/29/16, 10:38 - Mom: i've read a few acticles like that
4/29/16, 10:38 - Mom: just be cautious abt those supplements
4/29/16, 10:38 - Mom: nvm
4/29/16, 10:39 - Mom: ru going to nu?
4/29/16, 10:39 - Mom: or thinking abt nu?
4/29/16, 10:40 - Mom: does the kfc taste good in london?
4/29/16, 12:46 - Cindy L: Huh only the chicken wings.
4/29/16, 12:46 - Cindy L: Everything else is crap
4/29/16, 12:46 - Cindy L: Imo
4/29/16, 12:46 - Cindy L: Should I go to northwestern?
4/29/16, 12:46 - Cindy L: I feel like I should
4/29/16, 12:47 - Cindy L: I spent so much on that application.
4/29/16, 12:53 - Mom: do u feel like nu?
4/29/16, 12:53 - Mom: how's ur senpai doing at NU?
4/29/16, 12:57 - Cindy L: I dunno good?
4/29/16, 12:57 - Cindy L: Her photos seem happy.
4/29/16, 12:57 - Cindy L: But shes doing bme
4/29/16, 12:58 - Cindy L: Everything abt northwestern lookss nice and American unis in general
4/29/16, 12:58 - Mom: u shud talk to her abt the academic environment there and how the class is conducted? small class or mass lectures?
4/29/16, 12:58 - Mom: this is important
4/29/16, 12:59 - Mom: which school she goes to?
4/29/16, 12:59 - Cindy L: Oscar went to brown to visit and he came back like Julie Andrews in sound of music
4/29/16, 12:59 - Mom: wow
4/29/16, 13:00 - Mom: who's Oscar? HS friend?
4/29/16, 13:00 - Cindy L: Yea my KGV friend who I met in lse
4/29/16, 13:00 - Mom: he goes to brown?
4/29/16, 13:00 - Cindy L: No his bff does
4/29/16, 13:00 - Cindy L: Not brown risd
4/29/16, 13:01 - Cindy L: But if u get into risd, u are basically a brown student
4/29/16, 13:01 - Cindy L: Cuz u can take courses from both schools
4/29/16, 13:01 - Cindy L: It's like Harvard and mit
4/29/16, 13:01 - Cindy L: Which is like the best combination in the world.
4/29/16, 13:02 - Mom: like columbia du ba
4/29/16, 13:02 - Cindy L: No
4/29/16, 13:02 - Cindy L: Columbia u actually get two degrees lah
4/29/16, 13:02 - Cindy L: Brown student gets a brown degree
4/29/16, 13:02 - Cindy L: Risd student gets a risd degree
4/29/16, 13:02 - Cindy L: More like Columbia and Bernard
4/29/16, 13:02 - Cindy L: Except there's more hate at Columbia for this.
4/29/16, 13:03 - Mom: but u belong to Sci P and Columbia at the same time
4/29/16, 13:03 - Cindy L: Yea the dual ba is like dual citizenship
4/29/16, 13:03 - Mom: why more hate at Columbia?
4/29/16, 13:03 - Cindy L: I dunno
4/29/16, 13:04 - Cindy L: Cuz they think Barnard kids aren't worthy of a Columbia degree?
4/29/16, 13:04 - Mom: ic
4/29/16, 13:05 - Cindy L: I rejected so many stupid things last year that I am definitely leaning more towards going to NW
4/29/16, 13:05 - Mom: but will ppl in Barnard get Columbia deg? or Barnard deg only?
4/29/16, 13:05 - Cindy L: They get a Columbia degree
4/29/16, 13:05 - Cindy L: It's like gs
4/29/16, 13:06 - Mom: but even if u opt for dual ba, u still can't go to Columbia until 2 yrs later
4/29/16, 13:06 - Cindy L: So
4/29/16, 13:06 - Mom: and i wonder if u can change ur programme
4/29/16, 13:06 - Cindy L: At least I am still in Columbia.
4/29/16, 13:06 - Mom: but u have to do IR?
4/29/16, 13:06 - Cindy L: Sci po is not bad u know
4/29/16, 13:07 - Cindy L: I asked the French people and they said if u do u politics ofc go to sci po
4/29/16, 13:07 - Mom: so u still want to do politics?
4/29/16, 13:08 - Cindy L: Er I can't do the dual ba can i
4/29/16, 13:08 - Cindy L: Anyways
4/29/16, 13:09 - Mom: what do u mean u can't do the dual ba?
4/29/16, 13:09 - Cindy L: 1. The issue is whether I can do the biomed stream at ucl
4/29/16, 13:10 - Cindy L: 2. Then I'll compare the individual courses
4/29/16, 13:11 - Mom: but ucl won't tell u whether u can do biomed stream right now?
4/29/16, 13:11 - Cindy L: 3. I'm probably going into drug research or biotech at this point, so see which one has better network.
4/29/16, 13:12 - Cindy L: Everything i m pretty certain NW is better
4/29/16, 13:13 - Mom: all i know is that NU is pretty good at chemistry
4/29/16, 13:14 - Mom: and u have to compare the environment cuz doing studies at a university like campus wud be good for making new friends and normal daily activities
4/29/16, 13:15 - Mom: lse is rlly bad in this
4/29/16, 13:15 - Cindy L: Yea. And also the courses.
4/29/16, 13:16 - Cindy L: I dunno ask me three days later, see what I think.
4/29/16, 13:16 - Mom: basically, ucl's natural sci and nu weinberg are same
4/29/16, 13:16 - Mom: and u can have more courses to select at nu?
4/29/16, 13:16 - Mom: u shud ask ppl studying in both unis
4/29/16, 13:19 - Cindy L: Im talking abt the modules related to bio, biochem and neuro sci
4/29/16, 13:20 - Cindy L: Ofc I know Nat sci and Weinberg lib art are similar.
4/29/16, 13:21 - Mom: what i mean u wud be allowed to select what u want to take at Weinberg, but is this the same at ucl?
4/29/16, 13:21 - Cindy L: Lol
4/29/16, 13:21 - Mom: ??
4/29/16, 13:21 - Cindy L: I dont even know if I can take the life sciences stream
4/29/16, 13:22 - Mom: where at Weinberg or ucl?
4/29/16, 13:22 - Cindy L: But I know they are not very strict abt it, as long as timetabling permits it's ok
4/29/16, 13:22 - Cindy L: Ucl ofc.
4/29/16, 13:22 - Mom: ur prob is no a-level chem and bio
4/29/16, 13:23 - Mom: even if u got credits from ucb, still not known?
4/29/16, 13:23 - Cindy L: I won't know if certain unless I ask right?
4/29/16, 13:23 - Mom: yea
4/29/16, 13:24 - Cindy L: But I think with summer course should be allowed lah.
4/29/16, 13:24 - Mom: sure?
4/29/16, 13:24 - Cindy L: I mean there is no way they won't let u if u are qualified right?
4/29/16, 13:24 - Cindy L: Only lse would be that anal.
4/29/16, 13:24 - Mom: i heard that ucl is lenient at bio subj but for chem, rather strict
4/29/16, 13:25 - Mom: ok quit lse is definite right?
4/29/16, 13:26 - Cindy L: Hahahaha yah ofc.
4/29/16, 13:26 - Mom: and what will u do after doing this natural sci deg at ucl, if u opt for it?
4/29/16, 13:26 - Cindy L: When I have an NW transfer offer ofc quit.
4/29/16, 13:26 - Cindy L: Lse would hv to get on their knees and beg me to stay.
4/29/16, 13:27 - Mom: don't bullshit la
4/29/16, 13:27 - Mom: just forget lse
4/29/16, 13:27 - Cindy L: Okok
4/29/16, 13:27 - Mom: my Q at 0126 pm?
4/29/16, 13:28 - Cindy L: Told u probably biotech or drug research that thing.
4/29/16, 13:29 - Mom: so, what abt if u go to NU for 3 yrs and come back to ucl for Msc?
4/29/16, 13:29 - Mom: then u can avoid this question of whether u can opt for biomed stream?
4/29/16, 13:30 - Cindy L: Or bme
4/29/16, 13:30 - Cindy L: Yeah
4/29/16, 13:30 - Mom: still no news of ucl's bme?
4/29/16, 13:30 - Cindy L: I think that is a good option too
4/29/16, 13:30 - Cindy L: Yea no news
4/29/16, 13:30 - Cindy L: I think they already assume they responded.
4/29/16, 13:30 - Mom: well probably a No at the end of the day
4/29/16, 13:31 - Cindy L: Anyways.
4/29/16, 13:31 - Cindy L: There's always med, but I med school is another issue
4/29/16, 13:32 - Mom: after 3 yrs at NU, u still can go back to uk for med skl
4/29/16, 13:32 - Mom: well at Weinberg, can u pick bme courses?
4/29/16, 13:32 - Cindy L: U can minor I think
4/29/16, 13:33 - Mom: double major?
4/29/16, 13:33 - Cindy L: No lah
4/29/16, 13:33 - Cindy L: Only minor
4/29/16, 13:33 - Mom: ic
4/29/16, 13:33 - Cindy L: Plus they hv design engineering
4/29/16, 13:33 - Cindy L: üòÅ
4/29/16, 13:33 - Mom: so at NU, it is much more flexible
4/29/16, 13:33 - Cindy L: Yea
4/29/16, 13:34 - Mom: where design engrg? NU?
4/29/16, 13:34 - Cindy L: I think for that reason, a safe choice
4/29/16, 13:34 - Mom: yea, it looks like going to us wud be better choice
4/29/16, 13:35 - Mom: btw, u still can apply for transfer after 1 yr at NU
4/29/16, 13:35 - Cindy L: What do you mean
4/29/16, 13:35 - Cindy L: U mean like transfer after attending one yr
4/29/16, 13:35 - Cindy L: Yea
4/29/16, 13:35 - Cindy L: That
4/29/16, 13:35 - Mom: sure la
4/29/16, 13:36 - Cindy L: Is the beauty of decentralisatiob
4/29/16, 13:36 - Mom: if u want to go for an elite ivy
4/29/16, 13:36 - Mom: what do u mean by beauty of decentration?
4/29/16, 13:36 - Mom: *decentralisation
4/29/16, 13:37 - Mom: actually how good is NU?
4/29/16, 13:39 - Cindy L: Very good lah
4/29/16, 13:39 - Cindy L: Did u see their median Sat score
4/29/16, 13:39 - Cindy L: They accept the likes of Harvard
4/29/16, 13:40 - Cindy L: It's the place Rosanne wanted to go to, that's what I know
4/29/16, 13:40 - Cindy L: So the other browb
4/29/16, 13:40 - Cindy L: Brown
4/29/16, 13:40 - Cindy L: Plus
4/29/16, 13:41 - Cindy L: They are right next to university of Chicago along the gulf
4/29/16, 13:42 - Cindy L: Uof Chicago probably the uni which would top lse's econ.
4/29/16, 13:43 - Mom: all that i know already, but how's their reputation in US society?
4/29/16, 13:44 - Mom: for the SAT scores, i was a bit worried of ur sat scores when u applied for the transfer initially
4/29/16, 13:45 - Mom: Rosanne got rejected last yr?
4/29/16, 13:46 - Mom: it seems her success rate isn't that good ah
4/29/16, 13:46 - Mom: even worse than urs
4/29/16, 13:47 - Mom: i know NU is also famous for their econ, especially the Kellogg School
4/29/16, 13:48 - Mom: u might have advantage bc ur at lse
4/29/16, 13:58 - Cindy L: Pls my essay was fabulous
4/29/16, 13:58 - Cindy L: AHahahaha
4/29/16, 13:59 - Mom: oh, can u show me u essay? i want to see too
4/29/16, 13:59 - Cindy L: Yea probably.
4/29/16, 13:59 - Cindy L: Top most subscribed courses at nu are econ and bio
4/29/16, 14:00 - Mom: but it's bio isn't rated very high woo
4/29/16, 14:01 - Cindy L: They hv a med school, so probably premeds
4/29/16, 14:01 - Cindy L: They also hv a sleep clinic.
4/29/16, 14:01 - Mom: NU?
4/29/16, 14:01 - Cindy L: Yes
4/29/16, 14:01 - Cindy L: Well at their med school
4/29/16, 14:02 - Mom: if u can go to med skl in usa, good ah
4/29/16, 14:02 - Cindy L: But they hv a course abt circadian rhythms
4/29/16, 14:02 - Cindy L: So intense wor
4/29/16, 14:02 - Cindy L: I think I will die.
4/29/16, 14:03 - Cindy L: I will come back and go to imperial or something
4/29/16, 14:03 - Cindy L: Imperial is top 3 this year.
4/29/16, 14:03 - Mom: do what?
4/29/16, 14:03 - Cindy L: BME
4/29/16, 14:04 - Cindy L: Hahaha I will finally get into imperial
4/29/16, 14:04 - Cindy L: Actually no, that is a bad idea.
4/29/16, 14:04 - Mom: imperial syndrome
4/29/16, 14:04 - Cindy L: Should only come back to do med.
4/29/16, 14:04 - Cindy L: Or ucl neurosci
4/29/16, 14:05 - Mom: this sounds better
4/29/16, 14:05 - Cindy L: Actually neuroscience go to UCSD
4/29/16, 14:05 - Cindy L: Ok reason to come back would be for med then.
4/29/16, 14:06 - Mom: but ucl's neurosci is world second
4/29/16, 14:06 - Cindy L: Yea UCSD is world first
4/29/16, 14:06 - Mom: just after Harvard
4/29/16, 14:06 - Mom: no, just first in us?
4/29/16, 14:06 - Cindy L: Oh rite
4/29/16, 14:07 - Mom: then why u didn't consider ucsd last yr nei?
4/29/16, 14:07 - Cindy L: I don't know lah
4/29/16, 14:07 - Cindy L: Oh I rejected ucsd cuz I got Columbia
4/29/16, 14:07 - Cindy L: I was seriously planning to go to dual ba
4/29/16, 14:08 - Mom: i know, cuz ucsd is not ranked high like columbia ma
4/29/16, 14:08 - Mom: then u shud accept their proposal to defer one yr ma?
4/29/16, 14:08 - Cindy L: But I didn't plan to go backwards
4/29/16, 14:08 - Mom: i initially wud want u to do that but u seemed so determined
4/29/16, 14:08 - Cindy L: I mean now I wouldn't do the dual ba either cuz I move to the stem
4/29/16, 14:09 - Mom: exactly la
4/29/16, 14:09 - Cindy L: So defer is not much point
4/29/16, 14:09 - Mom: so going to dual ba isn't a good choice la
4/29/16, 14:09 - Cindy L: No initially it would be a good choice
4/29/16, 14:10 - Mom: if u go to Sci Po last yr, ur transfer might not be that easy
4/29/16, 14:10 - Mom: a good choice if u definitely want to do politics and ir
4/29/16, 14:10 - Cindy L: If I went to sci po I wouldn't hv needed to transfer üòë
4/29/16, 14:10 - Mom: and wud choose to work in politics, journalism
4/29/16, 14:11 - Mom: why not transfer? u can't do stem subj wow
4/29/16, 14:11 - Cindy L: I just need to finish the two yrs go to Columbia and switch to a science
4/29/16, 14:11 - Cindy L: Yea u can, some guy did earth science at Columbia
4/29/16, 14:11 - Mom: but ur offer is a dual ba wow?
4/29/16, 14:11 - Mom: is that possible?
4/29/16, 14:12 - Cindy L: And some guy did urban studies
4/29/16, 14:12 - Mom: well then u shud go to sci po in the first place
4/29/16, 14:12 - Cindy L: üò†
4/29/16, 14:13 - Mom: do u know this last yr?
4/29/16, 14:13 - Cindy L: Yea I told u.
4/29/16, 14:13 - Mom: no, i thought u have to do ir?
4/29/16, 14:14 - Cindy L: Yea only at scipo
4/29/16, 14:15 - Cindy L: I've already done it for one year, what makes two?
4/29/16, 14:16 - Cindy L: Omg now I think back lse was so horrible.
4/29/16, 14:16 - Mom: i didn't rlly understand their course, i thought at Sci Po, u guys just do general liberal arts course like mgt, law, langugae, etc
4/29/16, 14:16 - Cindy L: They didn't even give us a proper induction session
4/29/16, 14:16 - Mom: and when u go to Columbia, do some ir related courses
4/29/16, 14:16 - Mom: who knows lse is that bad, right?
4/29/16, 14:17 - Cindy L: Can u imagine going to work for the first day and then nobody even shows u how to use everything.
4/29/16, 14:17 - Cindy L: Or tell u where ur desk is.
4/29/16, 14:17 - Mom: do u understand their course structure in the beginning, lse
4/29/16, 14:17 - Cindy L: Dude I didn't even know where my classrooms were
4/29/16, 14:18 - Cindy L: Lol
4/29/16, 14:18 - Mom: the bad thing is we didn't go to lse's open day
4/29/16, 14:18 - Mom: if u had gone there, probably wont choose lse bc i don't like their campus indeed
4/29/16, 14:19 - Cindy L: Oh yea
4/29/16, 14:19 - Mom: this is the drawback of applying overseas without a campus visit beforehand
4/29/16, 14:20 - Mom: this is also my worry at le havre in the beginning
4/29/16, 14:20 - Mom: i can't imagine same thing happened at lse
4/29/16, 14:21 - Cindy L: Hahaha
4/29/16, 14:21 - Cindy L: That's true
4/29/16, 14:22 - Cindy L: To be fair le have is like one building.
4/29/16, 14:22 - Cindy L: Like going to a monastery
4/29/16, 14:22 - Mom: exactly
4/29/16, 14:22 - Cindy L: So there would be nothing to do but study
4/29/16, 14:23 - Mom: this is also why i negate Le Havre
4/29/16, 14:23 - Cindy L: But tbh here there is nothing to do but study
4/29/16, 14:23 - Cindy L: U can go to clubs and drink, but urgh those places are soooooo trashy.
4/29/16, 14:24 - Mom: the reason is: we never had a campus visit at lse!!!
4/29/16, 14:24 - Cindy L: OK campus visit quite important
4/29/16, 14:24 - Cindy L: Oh right
4/29/16, 14:24 - Cindy L: Important question
4/29/16, 14:24 - Cindy L: If I'm going to nu
4/29/16, 14:24 - Cindy L: Should I bother going to ucb?
4/29/16, 14:24 - Mom: and u were not lucky that even JHU's waiting has failed
4/29/16, 14:24 - Cindy L: Jhu is another caliber
4/29/16, 14:25 - Cindy L: I was lucky enough to get into so many good unis ok
4/29/16, 14:25 - Mom: this is also the Q i raised out a couple of days b4?
4/29/16, 14:25 - Cindy L: I dunno it ends mid August
4/29/16, 14:25 - Cindy L: And then nu starts in September.
4/29/16, 14:26 - Mom: if u were accepted by JHU, i wud def pursue u to go there even though u said Baltimore is dangerous
4/29/16, 14:26 - Cindy L: And I wouldn't need the extra credits then
4/29/16, 14:26 - Mom: if u still go to ucb, just treat it as extra uni experience
4/29/16, 14:26 - Mom: but is it necessary?
4/29/16, 14:27 - Mom: and u won't have time to rest
4/29/16, 14:27 - Cindy L: But then vusa issue
4/29/16, 14:27 - Cindy L: And do I go back to HK and then fly back to states again
4/29/16, 14:27 - Mom: yea
4/29/16, 14:27 - Mom: u want to stay in us until nu starts?
4/29/16, 14:28 - Mom: that wud be so tiring
4/29/16, 14:28 - Cindy L: I can't
4/29/16, 14:28 - Cindy L: I don't even know what to do with my visa thing.
4/29/16, 14:29 - Mom: if u go to nu, they'll process i-20 for u
4/29/16, 14:30 - Mom: if u decide not to go to ucb summer course, better withdraw it? or not?
4/29/16, 14:30 - Mom: can the credits earned at ucb be credited to nu's course?
4/29/16, 14:32 - Mom: but u wud be very tired at going and flying between hk and us
4/29/16, 14:32 - Cindy L: Yea I think credits are probably transferable
4/29/16, 14:33 - Cindy L: And I didn't plan anything to do over the summer either.
4/29/16, 14:34 - Mom: don't need rest?
4/29/16, 14:34 - Cindy L: Dude rest vs black hole in cv
4/29/16, 14:34 - Cindy L: No rest = black hole
4/29/16, 14:34 - Mom: but ur patient ma
4/29/16, 14:36 - Mom: now, first thing is check out how life is there in nu? if courses conducted good? wud that be like in lse?
4/29/16, 14:44 - Cindy L: Patient is also not a good thing to put on cv
4/29/16, 14:59 - Mom: .....
4/29/16, 15:46 - Cindy L: Interesting fact
4/29/16, 15:47 - Cindy L: Cindy Crawford is on the list of notable alumni
4/29/16, 15:47 - Cindy L: Of nu
4/29/16, 15:47 - Mom: i know already
4/29/16, 15:47 - Cindy L: Okok
4/29/16, 15:48 - Mom: i read their website already
4/29/16, 15:48 - Mom: it looks like most celebrities go to nu
4/29/16, 15:48 - Mom: i mean in the film section
4/29/16, 15:48 - Cindy L: Cuz they hv a famous journalism course
4/29/16, 15:48 - Cindy L: That's why u see Stephen Colbert
4/29/16, 15:48 - Mom: yea
4/29/16, 15:49 - Cindy L: Seth meyera
4/29/16, 15:49 - Cindy L: All political commentators
4/29/16, 15:49 - Mom: but every yr, lots of students from communication apply for transfer to other skl
4/29/16, 15:49 - Cindy L: I see
4/29/16, 15:49 - Cindy L: Shrugs
4/29/16, 15:50 - Cindy L: Their engineering lab looks amazing though
4/29/16, 15:50 - Mom: the best of a normal uni is that student can change majors easily
4/29/16, 15:51 - Mom: attending lse is srsly disadvantageous in this respect
4/29/16, 15:51 - Cindy L: Yeah
4/29/16, 15:51 - Cindy L: At least ucl and Kings u can try to do internal transfer
4/29/16, 15:52 - Cindy L: With external u t automatically screened out if u don't fit criteria
4/29/16, 15:52 - Mom: so the lesson is: never choose a specialized uni
4/29/16, 15:52 - Cindy L: Yah unless u already know u will be a banker
4/29/16, 15:52 - Mom: unless ur rlly determined to do that particular subj like architecture
4/29/16, 15:53 - Mom: yea
4/29/16, 15:53 - Cindy L: Hard to imagine anyone having a burning passion to be an accountant
4/29/16, 15:53 - Mom: how kcl and ucl do interna transfer?
4/29/16, 15:53 - Mom: sigh..
4/29/16, 15:53 - Cindy L: As in u can switch between internal courses
4/29/16, 15:53 - Mom: u can't understand la
4/29/16, 15:53 - Mom: rlly?
4/29/16, 15:53 - Mom: this is good ah
4/29/16, 15:53 - Cindy L: The fiery passion of an accountant to move numbers?
4/29/16, 15:54 - Cindy L: No I really don't understand
4/29/16, 15:54 - Mom: so one from kcl can choose course in ucl?
4/29/16, 15:54 - Cindy L: No
4/29/16, 15:54 - Cindy L: As in within their own uni ofc
4/29/16, 15:54 - Mom: u don't need a passion to be an accountant
4/29/16, 15:54 - Cindy L: Yea that's true
4/29/16, 15:54 - Mom: just a passion to avoid doing work
4/29/16, 15:54 - Cindy L: U shit aroudn for the year and then read lecture notes once the week before exams
4/29/16, 15:55 - Cindy L: And even when u are revising for exam, u procrastinate like hell
4/29/16, 15:55 - Mom: u mean A&F guys
4/29/16, 15:55 - Cindy L: = fabulous accountant
4/29/16, 15:55 - Cindy L: Finance is hard
4/29/16, 15:56 - Cindy L: I hang around the actuaries and they all say the finance module is hard.
4/29/16, 15:56 - Cindy L: And they r all like super good at math
4/29/16, 15:56 - Mom: accounting is not the end, ambitious ppl wud want to do mgt and finance at top level
4/29/16, 15:56 - Cindy L: They eat math for breakfast
4/29/16, 15:57 - Mom: actuaries don't do accounting
4/29/16, 15:57 - Cindy L: I know lah
4/29/16, 15:57 - Mom: they do financial maths like present value, future value, interest rate...
4/29/16, 15:57 - Cindy L: But I've just been talking to the guy who failed last year.
4/29/16, 15:57 - Cindy L: That's why it's been very uninspiring
4/29/16, 15:58 - Mom: dumb dumb
4/29/16, 15:58 - Cindy L: He does finance and stats though
4/29/16, 15:58 - Cindy L: So he regrets not doing the infamous ac100
4/29/16, 15:58 - Mom: interesting?
4/29/16, 15:58 - Cindy L: The super easy accounting course.
4/29/16, 15:58 - Mom: one who is admitted to lse shud have excellent exam results
4/29/16, 15:59 - Cindy L: Nah mediocre maths
4/29/16, 15:59 - Cindy L: Alright lah
4/29/16, 15:59 - Mom: how can he be not doing similar things?
4/29/16, 15:59 - Cindy L: Lse is always second option not first
4/29/16, 15:59 - Mom: oxbridge rejects ma
4/29/16, 15:59 - Cindy L: Dude I wish I did the harder math modules.
4/29/16, 16:00 - Mom: but still they shud have good exam results
4/29/16, 16:00 - Cindy L: The math exams at uni aare much easier to get first
4/29/16, 16:00 - Mom: so, don't understand why those guys fail their exam
4/29/16, 16:01 - Cindy L: Cuz he didn't learn shit and spent the whole year collecting girls like pokemons.
4/29/16, 16:01 - Mom: if u did harder maths module, wud u be not sleeping at class?
4/29/16, 16:02 - Cindy L: Doesn't matter, it's abt going to the library and working through the proofs
4/29/16, 16:02 - Mom: ÈõÜÈÉµÔºü
4/29/16, 16:02 - Cindy L: Ys
4/29/16, 16:03 - Cindy L: Nobody collects stamps these days though
4/29/16, 16:03 - Mom: finally i understand what ÈõÜÈÉµ means
4/29/16, 16:03 - Cindy L: üòÇ
4/29/16, 16:03 - Mom: collecting pokemon
4/29/16, 16:04 - Cindy L: He's still collecting, it's so funny.
4/29/16, 16:04 - Mom: POKEMON GO!
4/29/16, 16:06 - Cindy L: I think ÈõÜÈÉµ is better term though
4/29/16, 16:06 - Mom: no it isnt
4/29/16, 16:07 - Mom: emos said i shud play pokemon red
4/29/16, 16:08 - Cindy L: its a more fitting term
4/29/16, 16:09 - Mom: foine
4/29/16, 16:10 - Mom: that's why he failed his exam la
4/29/16, 16:11 - Mom: he deserves it
4/29/16, 18:07 - Cindy L: Walao
4/29/16, 18:07 - Mom: walao
4/29/16, 21:50 - Cindy L: My eye is hurting.
4/29/16, 21:50 - Cindy L: Maybe it's telling me I need to sleep
4/29/16, 23:14 - Mom: oh, take a rest la
4/30/16, 00:05 - Cindy L: Yea I took 20 min nap and it stopped hurting.
4/30/16, 00:05 - Cindy L: My rem symptoms seem to be decreasing in severity.
4/30/16, 00:06 - Cindy L: Except for cataplexy
4/30/16, 00:06 - Cindy L: Shaking attacks not as often now
4/30/16, 00:06 - Cindy L: Unless they are laughter induced.
4/30/16, 00:06 - Mom: Rem decrease bc drug taken?
4/30/16, 00:06 - Cindy L: No
4/30/16, 00:07 - Cindy L: I don't take anything right now.
4/30/16, 00:07 - Mom: Ok
4/30/16, 00:07 - Mom: go sleep la
4/30/16, 02:16 - Cindy L: I looked at the nu course catalogue
4/30/16, 02:16 - Cindy L: It's like first year u don't learn anything.
4/30/16, 02:43 - Cindy L: OK my bad I was looking at the seminars
4/30/16, 02:46 - Mom: what catalogue?
4/30/16, 02:46 - Mom: nu? ucl?
4/30/16, 02:47 - Cindy L: Nu course catalogue
4/30/16, 02:47 - Cindy L: Ucl I already looked at before
4/30/16, 02:47 - Cindy L: The biomed stream is really good imo
4/30/16, 02:47 - Mom: what meant by learn nothing for first yr?
4/30/16, 02:48 - Cindy L: Like u do first yr courses lah
4/30/16, 02:48 - Cindy L: Most for meeting requirement
4/30/16, 02:48 - Mom: i mean what do nu require for first yr?
4/30/16, 02:49 - Mom: and do u think u can gain credits hr for those courses?
4/30/16, 02:49 - Cindy L: They have like different categories and u have to take two courses in each section
4/30/16, 02:49 - Mom: so little?
4/30/16, 02:50 - Mom: altogether 6 in a yr?
4/30/16, 02:50 - Cindy L: That's for lib art requirements
4/30/16, 02:50 - Cindy L: Not major req
4/30/16, 02:50 - Mom: ok
4/30/16, 02:50 - Mom: general core requirements
4/30/16, 02:50 - Cindy L: Yea
4/30/16, 02:50 - Mom: fairy enough
4/30/16, 02:50 - Mom: useless
4/30/16, 02:50 - Cindy L: I was looking at the science courses
4/30/16, 02:51 - Cindy L: And u need to take a lot of the in order
4/30/16, 02:51 - Cindy L: Like they have a 300 chem unit on drug design
4/30/16, 02:51 - Mom: 300 chem for first yr student?
4/30/16, 02:51 - Cindy L: But need organic chem 200
4/30/16, 02:51 - Cindy L: Ofc not
4/30/16, 02:52 - Cindy L: And the organic chem needs chem 103
4/30/16, 02:52 - Mom: do they have chem 100?
4/30/16, 02:52 - Cindy L: Which u have to do 101 and 102
4/30/16, 02:52 - Cindy L: So to do any 300 chem course u need to start from chem 101
4/30/16, 02:52 - Mom: those r the pre-requisites
4/30/16, 02:52 - Mom: exactly
4/30/16, 02:53 - Mom: yesterday i went through the dual ba columbia courses again
4/30/16, 02:53 - Cindy L: Ok
4/30/16, 02:53 - Mom: that requires similar things in order
4/30/16, 02:53 - Cindy L: Definitely not as interchangeable as I thought
4/30/16, 02:54 - Cindy L: Not like brown
4/30/16, 02:54 - Mom: so i was wondering if u guys transfer from Sci Po at the end of second yr
4/30/16, 02:54 - Cindy L: Brown is crazy
4/30/16, 02:54 - Mom: wud there be enough time to complete the major requirements at Columbia at the end of 2 yrs there?
4/30/16, 02:54 - Cindy L: Yea some guy did
4/30/16, 02:54 - Mom: if u want to choose science stream?
4/30/16, 02:55 - Mom: he spent more time?
4/30/16, 02:55 - Cindy L: Maybe I don't know,
4/30/16, 02:55 - Cindy L: There's summer as well
4/30/16, 02:55 - Cindy L: But it doesn't really help much
4/30/16, 02:55 - Cindy L: Summer is just an extra quarter
4/30/16, 02:56 - Mom: like if u do biomed as major, u still have to go through courses starting 1xxx to 4xxx which normally require 4 yrs' time
4/30/16, 02:56 - Cindy L: Yea
4/30/16, 02:56 - Mom: so conclusion might be the guy spent extra time at Columbia
4/30/16, 02:56 - Cindy L: I think it's good idea to know what u plan to major in
4/30/16, 02:56 - Mom: ofc
4/30/16, 02:57 - Cindy L: Or else u will end up as a gender studies major
4/30/16, 02:57 - Mom: so when u pick general courses, i mean introductory courses, u have those pre-requisite
4/30/16, 02:58 - Mom: science major doesn't do the same way as liberal arts which wudn't have pre-requisite as generally
4/30/16, 02:58 - Mom: so dual ba is much more suitable for liberal arts subj
4/30/16, 02:58 - Cindy L: Well I looked at the chem stuff
4/30/16, 02:58 - Cindy L: I will have to take one unit of chem each quarter
4/30/16, 02:59 - Cindy L: And it will take me two years to get to chem 300
4/30/16, 02:59 - Mom: so if u do ucb summer course, that wud be helpful for pre-requisite at nu
4/30/16, 02:59 - Cindy L: Not really its just one unit
4/30/16, 03:00 - Cindy L: And I think it's better to just follow their flow
4/30/16, 03:00 - Mom: why?
4/30/16, 03:00 - Cindy L: Cuz every unis chem 101 102 and 103 will be slightly different
4/30/16, 03:00 - Mom: can u taken 2 of them simultaneouly?
4/30/16, 03:01 - Cindy L: No
4/30/16, 03:01 - Cindy L: Each of them has the pre req of the previous
4/30/16, 03:01 - Mom: so basically ucb general chem is no use?
4/30/16, 03:02 - Cindy L: To do the medical chem course I have to do 
101 102 103 211 212 and 213
4/30/16, 03:02 - Cindy L: If I went to ucb that would be still five units.
4/30/16, 03:03 - Mom: for what?
4/30/16, 03:03 - Mom: 101 102 103?
4/30/16, 03:03 - Mom: exempted?
4/30/16, 03:03 - Cindy L: No u wish
4/30/16, 03:03 - Cindy L: Only 101
4/30/16, 03:03 - Cindy L: I'm only doing chem 101
4/30/16, 03:04 - Cindy L: Even if u did ap chem, there's no skipping
4/30/16, 03:04 - Mom: ha ha ha
4/30/16, 03:04 - Cindy L: Gotta do it in that order
4/30/16, 03:04 - Cindy L: So one of my slots will be reserved for chem
4/30/16, 03:04 - Mom: tough
4/30/16, 03:04 - Mom: bio is important too
4/30/16, 03:05 - Cindy L: Yes I haven't been able to find the biological sci courses
4/30/16, 03:05 - Cindy L: So I ll be doing those too
4/30/16, 03:05 - Cindy L: And then neuroscience is slightly better
4/30/16, 03:05 - Mom: how many need to do every quarter?
4/30/16, 03:05 - Cindy L: Not sure
4/30/16, 03:05 - Cindy L: I just know there r three quarters
4/30/16, 03:06 - Mom: well u have to read the total requirement for meeting deg and work back out how many u have to do every yr and every quarter
4/30/16, 03:07 - Mom: and it's now 0306, better sleep first la
4/30/16, 03:07 - Cindy L: Yes
4/30/16, 03:08 - Cindy L: That's what I plan to do tmr
4/30/16, 03:08 - Cindy L: I hv to work out which 300 courses I want to take and work backwards to see what I need to take
4/30/16, 03:10 - Mom: yea
4/30/16, 03:12 - Cindy L: I forgot to mention u need to learn a foreign lang
4/30/16, 18:08 - Cindy L: So....
4/30/16, 18:09 - Cindy L: Seems like by the time I go through all the pre reqs for the 300 level courses, I would hv enough credits to graduate
4/30/16, 18:09 - Cindy L: Hahaha
4/30/16, 18:10 - Cindy L: I was putting together the courses I need for a major in biological sciences and minor in chem
4/30/16, 18:11 - Cindy L: I have to spend a lot of time going through the fundamentals
4/30/16, 18:11 - Cindy L: The Americans are very thorough with learning the fundamentals.
4/30/16, 18:11 - Cindy L: Ucl natsci u learn biochem in first yr
4/30/16, 18:12 - Cindy L: But nu you can't do biochem until around third year
4/30/16, 18:29 - Mom: so just basic learning at nu?
4/30/16, 18:48 - Cindy L: Cuz it aims to prepare you for study at master level
4/30/16, 18:59 - Mom: but for a 4 yr uni student, he/she def have enough time to study what's at chem 3xx, 4xx
4/30/16, 19:00 - Mom: what prob is there?
4/30/16, 19:20 - Cindy L: Yea four year student üòÖ
4/30/16, 19:20 - Cindy L: I only have three years
4/30/16, 19:22 - Cindy L: I need to think longer
4/30/16, 19:28 - Mom: ur so funny
4/30/16, 19:38 - Mom: one more point: can u still apply for the financial aids/scholarship at nu?
4/30/16, 19:38 - Mom: i read from their website that they do offer scholarship to international students
4/30/16, 19:40 - Cindy L: I dunno if I pass the deadline or not.
4/30/16, 19:41 - Cindy L: This is an issue cuz I'm planning to major in neurosci and at the end of three years I will only have maybe done one or two units of neurosci. Which is kind of disappointing üòë
4/30/16, 19:41 - Cindy L: I might as well major in chem
4/30/16, 19:42 - Cindy L: I can't even take bio chem until I go through all of inorganic and organic chem.
4/30/16, 19:42 - Mom: u can double major at nu
4/30/16, 19:42 - Cindy L: Yea i guess but it all depends on what courses are offered during that quarter
4/30/16, 19:43 - Cindy L: I think I will be a good scientist since I will know the basics very well
4/30/16, 19:45 - Cindy L: The ucl natsci biomed and med physics stream is not bad either, but I expect they will feed u the basics very quickly
4/30/16, 19:46 - Mom: if u don't do the basic chem and cellular biology, u can be able to learn the brain's technical things right?
4/30/16, 19:47 - Cindy L: U mean at nu?
4/30/16, 19:47 - Cindy L: No
4/30/16, 19:47 - Cindy L: U must do chem
4/30/16, 19:47 - Mom: for the biomed or neurosci at ucl, do u know whether they're technical based or behavioral analysis based
4/30/16, 19:47 - Cindy L: Biomed is functional based
4/30/16, 19:47 - Mom: what functional?
4/30/16, 19:48 - Cindy L: There's another stream which is similar to cognitive science
4/30/16, 19:48 - Cindy L: Which studies behaviour
4/30/16, 19:48 - Cindy L: Biomed is more neurophysiology
4/30/16, 19:48 - Cindy L: As in u studying how the neurons actually work and stuff
4/30/16, 19:49 - Cindy L: So it involves more molecular and cellular bio
4/30/16, 19:49 - Mom: so biology is impt as a pre-requisite
4/30/16, 19:49 - Cindy L: No biology is recommended.
4/30/16, 19:49 - Cindy L: None of the bio u study in HS is relevant
4/30/16, 19:50 - Mom: both unis don't require pre-requisite of bio b4 taking molecular and cellular bio?
4/30/16, 19:50 - Cindy L: Er nu basically makes u take everything from the beginning
4/30/16, 19:51 - Mom: beginning from hs course?
4/30/16, 19:51 - Cindy L: No the bio u learn at uni is different to hs
4/30/16, 19:51 - Cindy L: It's abt physiology
4/30/16, 19:51 - Mom: ok
4/30/16, 19:51 - Cindy L: And anatomy
4/30/16, 19:52 - Cindy L: And u don't cover those things in ha
4/30/16, 19:52 - Cindy L: Hs
4/30/16, 19:52 - Mom: this is the difference between a us and uk uni
4/30/16, 19:52 - Cindy L: What is? That's UK uni is very fast pace I think
4/30/16, 19:52 - Cindy L: Or maybe just in terms of stem
4/30/16, 19:52 - Cindy L: I was looking at BME
4/30/16, 19:52 - Cindy L: For nu
4/30/16, 19:53 - Cindy L: And thinking that I may as well do bme
4/30/16, 19:54 - Mom: i don't think uk uni is fast pace, in fact they require a preliminary understanding of the subj ur going to major
4/30/16, 19:54 - Cindy L: No not really.
4/30/16, 19:54 - Mom: and the span might not be exactly the same as that in us uni
4/30/16, 19:54 - Cindy L: U go in first year they reteach u the ib requirements.
4/30/16, 19:54 - Mom: might be more focus in a narrow area
4/30/16, 19:55 - Cindy L: Hmmmm focus maybe. I need to take another look at the ucl courses
4/30/16, 19:55 - Cindy L: But in general I think, nu spends more time in laying the foundations
4/30/16, 19:56 - Mom: if u said uk uni redo those at ib level subj, why is that a student having econ and history background can't be accepted to sci stream?
4/30/16, 19:56 - Cindy L: I don't know.
4/30/16, 19:57 - Cindy L: They don't think they hv the aptitude for it?
4/30/16, 19:57 - Cindy L: I mean, I don't get why lse expect hl maths either
4/30/16, 19:57 - Cindy L: Cuz hey reteach it.
4/30/16, 19:58 - Cindy L: Same for econ
4/30/16, 19:58 - Mom: if in first yr, redo a-level/ib chem and bio, how wud there be enough time to go through so much other technical stuff at just second and third yr?
4/30/16, 19:58 - Cindy L: Cuz they teach at a very fast pace
4/30/16, 19:58 - Cindy L: Hl math was done in four weeks
4/30/16, 19:59 - Mom: so basically, they only teach at second yr?
4/30/16, 19:59 - Cindy L: No first year Mt is recap + new stuff
4/30/16, 19:59 - Mom: and that's only ONE complete yr to learn new things?
4/30/16, 19:59 - Cindy L: They also get faster and faster
4/30/16, 19:59 - Cindy L: At least in lse it's like that
4/30/16, 20:00 - Cindy L: That's how they get through so much technical stuff in three years
4/30/16, 20:00 - Cindy L: I can give u an example
4/30/16, 20:01 - Cindy L: My current half year math course is equivalent to three separate units in nu
4/30/16, 20:02 - Cindy L: So either at nu, they cover in more depth or they expect u to take up to ten units each quarter
4/30/16, 20:02 - Mom: no, at nu a total of 48 units r required for graduation
4/30/16, 20:02 - Cindy L: 45 for weinberg
4/30/16, 20:03 - Mom: that means u have to take 4 units for every quarter
4/30/16, 20:03 - Cindy L: Thats 4 courses
4/30/16, 20:03 - Mom: right
4/30/16, 20:04 - Cindy L: Since I have to reserve two for doig the chem and biol sci journey
4/30/16, 20:04 - Mom: us shud have some regulation on the definition of a full-term student, rmb uch summer course?
4/30/16, 20:05 - Mom: *full-time
4/30/16, 20:05 - Cindy L: Oh yeah
4/30/16, 20:06 - Cindy L: But four courses is def enough that's 12 contact hrs a week
4/30/16, 20:06 - Cindy L: Wait only 12 hrs a week?
4/30/16, 20:06 - Mom: and don't forget that doing social sci subj is so different from doing a pure sci deg which requires lots of factual and technical knowledge
4/30/16, 20:07 - Mom: and u can't skip alot in ur learning process
4/30/16, 20:07 - Cindy L: Yea 12 hrs a week is very little.
4/30/16, 20:07 - Cindy L: Isn't it
4/30/16, 20:07 - Mom: no, shud be 20 hrs teaching time
4/30/16, 20:07 - Cindy L: It's 3 hrs per week for every course
4/30/16, 20:08 - Mom: 3 units = 3 hrs meeting time?
4/30/16, 20:08 - Mom: might not be?
4/30/16, 20:09 - Cindy L: No 3 hrs for every course dude.
4/30/16, 20:09 - Cindy L: So we said 4 units per quarter before right
4/30/16, 20:10 - Mom: yea
4/30/16, 20:10 - Cindy L: That makes 4*3 = 12 hrs
4/30/16, 20:10 - Mom: sure not la?
4/30/16, 20:10 - Mom: 12 hrs a week = 3 hr for 4 days?
4/30/16, 20:10 - Mom: how wud that be?
4/30/16, 20:10 - Mom: so little meeting time?
4/30/16, 20:11 - Cindy L: Yea
4/30/16, 20:11 - Cindy L: Need to check
4/30/16, 20:12 - Mom: i'll tty in the morning hk time
4/30/16, 20:14 - Cindy L: K
4/30/16, 21:45 - Cindy L: Oh my god.
4/30/16, 21:46 - Cindy L: These ppl get into Google after undergrad
4/30/16, 21:47 - Cindy L: Seriously on a different tier of networking here
5/1/16, 05:36 - Cindy L: Slept around 0100 last night
5/1/16, 05:36 - Cindy L: Woke up at 0250
5/1/16, 05:36 - Cindy L: To go to toilet
5/1/16, 05:37 - Cindy L: Now awake again, can't go back to sleep, really thirsty
5/1/16, 05:37 - Cindy L: Like my throat is on fire.
5/1/16, 05:37 - Cindy L: But I already drank water.
5/1/16, 00:33 - Mom: Who?
5/1/16, 09:27 - Cindy L: Who what?
5/1/16, 09:28 - Cindy L: Oh the Google people? Nu
5/1/16, 09:27 - Mom: then?
5/1/16, 09:27 - Mom: what time to sleep again?
5/1/16, 09:31 - Cindy L: OK I realised I ran out of data
5/1/16, 09:31 - Mom: u mean u woke up at 0250 to go to toilet? but what time to sleep again? immediate after toilet?
5/1/16, 09:31 - Cindy L: Yah
5/1/16, 09:31 - Mom: ur throat is on fire?
5/1/16, 09:31 - Mom: flu?
5/1/16, 09:32 - Cindy L: Yes
5/1/16, 09:32 - Mom: or u sleep with ur mouth open?
5/1/16, 09:32 - Cindy L: Whoops no
5/1/16, 09:32 - Cindy L: Argh
5/1/16, 09:32 - Mom: if flu, then need to take some med
5/1/16, 09:32 - Cindy L: So I went back to sleep right after going to the toilet
5/1/16, 09:32 - Cindy L: I don't think it's the flu
5/1/16, 09:32 - Mom: ic
5/1/16, 09:32 - Cindy L: But indoor air is bad quality
5/1/16, 09:33 - Cindy L: Killing my nose
5/1/16, 09:33 - Mom: oh
5/1/16, 09:33 - Cindy L: And when I turn my head around, I seem to sleep better
5/1/16, 09:33 - Mom: no heating? shudn't be that bad woooo?
5/1/16, 09:33 - Cindy L: I think heating makes the air worse.
5/1/16, 09:33 - Cindy L: There is heating.
5/1/16, 09:33 - Mom: yea
5/1/16, 09:34 - Cindy L: I said indoor air.
5/1/16, 09:34 - Mom: still have heating indoor?
5/1/16, 09:34 - Cindy L: When I go out the air is colder
5/1/16, 09:34 - Cindy L: But my nose is fine.
5/1/16, 09:34 - Mom: ic
5/1/16, 09:34 - Mom: that's the heating which makes air unpleasant
5/1/16, 09:34 - Mom: since u can't turn off the heating, no way
5/1/16, 09:34 - Cindy L: I don't know.
5/1/16, 09:35 - Mom: better open the window wide
5/1/16, 09:35 - Cindy L: I open the window to refresh the air.
5/1/16, 09:35 - Cindy L: But I doesn't work.
5/1/16, 09:35 - Mom: can u turn off the heating inside ur room?
5/1/16, 09:35 - Cindy L: My nose is still dying.
5/1/16, 09:35 - Cindy L: So I don't know if it's the heating or not.
5/1/16, 09:35 - Cindy L: And it's freezing in here, so I don't even know if it's the heating.
5/1/16, 09:36 - Mom: put a glass of water beside ur bed at the time of sleeping, this wud help
5/1/16, 09:36 - Mom: freezing inside ur room?
5/1/16, 09:36 - Mom: even colder than outdoors?
5/1/16, 09:36 - Cindy L: No
5/1/16, 09:37 - Cindy L: The rooms in this side r cold cuz we're facing the street, hence the wind
5/1/16, 09:37 - Mom: do u know the direction?
5/1/16, 09:38 - Cindy L: Went I go out I have the wind blow in my face. I don't need to know direction.
5/1/16, 09:38 - Cindy L: The other side faces the carpark
5/1/16, 09:38 - Cindy L: But their air is worse, they never open the windows back there.
5/1/16, 09:38 - Mom: no, i mean if it's NE, then it's freezing even indoors
5/1/16, 09:39 - Cindy L: It's only in HK üòë
5/1/16, 09:39 - Cindy L: I don't know which direction it's supposed to be here, the Windy direction.
5/1/16, 09:39 - Cindy L: It's windy in all directions.
5/1/16, 09:40 - Cindy L: Anyways
5/1/16, 09:40 - Mom: ok, try put water beside ur bed when u sleep, see if that help relieve ur nose
5/1/16, 09:40 - Cindy L: So I managed to go back to sleep after turning my head around to the other end of the bed
5/1/16, 09:41 - Mom: ok good
5/1/16, 09:41 - Cindy L: For now.
5/1/16, 09:41 - Mom: try new ways to sleep la
5/1/16, 09:41 - Cindy L: I seem to sleep better at the other end.
5/1/16, 09:41 - Cindy L: For now.
5/1/16, 09:41 - Mom: means ur heading the door?
5/1/16, 09:41 - Cindy L: Yah
5/1/16, 09:42 - Mom: ooooo
5/1/16, 09:43 - Cindy L: Or maybe it was only the morning.
5/1/16, 09:43 - Cindy L: I think i was sleep talking this morning
5/1/16, 09:43 - Mom: sleep talking?
5/1/16, 09:43 - Cindy L: Or maybe I was dreaming.
5/1/16, 09:44 - Mom: u heard what u talked?
5/1/16, 09:44 - Cindy L: I'm not sure, I feel like I said stuff out loud
5/1/16, 09:44 - Mom: just few words?
5/1/16, 09:44 - Mom: did u rmb ur dream?
5/1/16, 09:45 - Cindy L: No it was like I was arguing with someone
5/1/16, 09:45 - Cindy L: I was taking care of a lion like a dog
5/1/16, 09:46 - Mom: so u rlly had dream b4 waking up this morning
5/1/16, 09:47 - Cindy L: Yah
5/1/16, 09:50 - Cindy L: OK after a long deliberation
5/1/16, 09:51 - Cindy L: I think I'll go to northwestern
5/1/16, 09:52 - Cindy L: At least its easier to get a job afterwards, and the students dont hate the school
5/1/16, 09:53 - Cindy L: They hv study abroad to ucl anyways if I really wanted to.
5/1/16, 09:54 - Cindy L: Ill see if I can still apply for financial aid.
5/1/16, 09:55 - Mom: have u checked with ur senpai Janet Chen for the students' lives and satisafaction there?
5/1/16, 09:55 - Mom: and the actual teaching situation - small class or mass lectures?
5/1/16, 09:55 - Cindy L: I already checked those before I applied.
5/1/16, 09:56 - Mom: ic
5/1/16, 09:57 - Mom: i just read through nu's website for major declaration, i think u probably can finish it within the rest of 3 yrs there
5/1/16, 09:57 - Mom: since u have three yrs, not 2 yrs
5/1/16, 09:57 - Mom: neurosci + chem right?
5/1/16, 09:58 - Cindy L: No biolsci and chem
5/1/16, 09:58 - Mom: not neurosci?
5/1/16, 09:59 - Mom: i thought ur going to do neuroscience as major?
5/1/16, 09:59 - Cindy L: They hv a neurobio concentration
5/1/16, 09:59 - Cindy L: U need biolsci to do immunology and proteins and biochem
5/1/16, 09:59 - Mom: ok, i'll check it again
5/1/16, 10:00 - Cindy L: If u do neurosci and chem, it doesnt go as well together.
5/1/16, 10:00 - Mom: ru going to learn the functions of ur brain and how the neurons operate inside ur brain?
5/1/16, 10:00 - Cindy L: I think compsci and neurosci would go better with each other.
5/1/16, 10:01 - Cindy L: I'm coming for cell bio basically.
5/1/16, 10:01 - Mom: ok
5/1/16, 10:02 - Cindy L: Which is annoying because initially u need chem
5/1/16, 10:02 - Cindy L: And then right at the end u need physics
5/1/16, 10:02 - Cindy L: And if u need physics u need calculus.
5/1/16, 10:05 - Mom: u have ib physics and maths, not applicable?
5/1/16, 10:05 - Mom: didn't do calculus?
5/1/16, 10:05 - Cindy L: <Media omitted>
5/1/16, 10:06 - Cindy L: U have to learn everything again
5/1/16, 10:06 - Cindy L: Or pass the placement tests
5/1/16, 10:06 - Cindy L: They don't even allow ap to skip
5/1/16, 10:07 - Cindy L: Since I had so many pre reqs to do to get a pure science degree,  I thought I might look at the BME reqs as well
5/1/16, 10:08 - Cindy L: They poop on the ib as someone brilliantly put it in on reddit
5/1/16, 10:08 - Cindy L: I think I can skip some of the math though, I hope cuz I already did it in lse
5/1/16, 10:09 - Mom: sorry, the courses u listed above is for what major?
5/1/16, 10:10 - Cindy L: Biol sci and chem
5/1/16, 10:11 - Mom: so what r the major requirements to graduate?
5/1/16, 10:11 - Cindy L: Not even major, just pre reqs to do the 300 level courses
5/1/16, 10:11 - Cindy L: Can't remember its on the site.
5/1/16, 10:13 - Mom: this is not reasonable cuz even if u starts at freshman, u only need to take 12 courses every year and a total of 24 b4 doing ur major?
5/1/16, 10:13 - Mom: ur list looks more than 24 wow
5/1/16, 10:14 - Mom: if u've to take all those b4 allowing to proceed to junior?
5/1/16, 10:14 - Cindy L: Noo
5/1/16, 10:15 - Cindy L: Junior just means third year.
5/1/16, 10:15 - Mom: i know
5/1/16, 10:15 - Mom: if u said those courses on ur list r all pre-reqisite, u have to finish all? before do ur major at yr3?
5/1/16, 10:16 - Cindy L: I counted I needed to do at least 30 units before getting up to 300 level biol sci
5/1/16, 10:16 - Cindy L: Which is where all the neurobio stuff is.
5/1/16, 10:16 - Mom: and u still have to do major courses
5/1/16, 10:16 - Cindy L: Then I can do two or three of those
5/1/16, 10:17 - Cindy L: Those r major reqs
5/1/16, 10:17 - Mom: then altogether must be far more than 45/48 required for a Bachelor deg
5/1/16, 10:17 - Cindy L: All the shit I just listed
5/1/16, 10:17 - Cindy L: Those r major reqs
5/1/16, 10:18 - Cindy L: With the except for chem 101 102 and 103
5/1/16, 10:18 - Cindy L: All the 200+ ones r major reqs
5/1/16, 10:18 - Mom: <Media omitted>
5/1/16, 10:18 - Cindy L: I can't do chem 172
5/1/16, 10:19 - Cindy L: I don't have ib or ap chem
5/1/16, 10:19 - Cindy L: Basically I've never done chem before.
5/1/16, 10:19 - Mom: see this list which i just compiled from nu's website required for neurosci major deg
5/1/16, 10:19 - Mom: so u can start with 101, 102, 103
5/1/16, 10:20 - Cindy L: If u do neurosci u don't hv biochem
5/1/16, 10:21 - Cindy L: Which means u're basically a psychologist
5/1/16, 10:21 - Cindy L: U need to do neurobio to do biolsci 308
5/1/16, 10:21 - Cindy L: Which is biochem
5/1/16, 10:22 - Cindy L: Biochem is standard course for any further medical course
5/1/16, 10:22 - Mom: see the 2nd yr course: bio sci 217
5/1/16, 10:22 - Cindy L: So it mammalian physiology and anatomy
5/1/16, 10:23 - Cindy L: That's physiology OK fair enough, u sort of cover human physio but they also hv animal physio at 300
5/1/16, 10:24 - Mom: nvm
5/1/16, 10:24 - Mom: perhaps taking more time to finish that deg
5/1/16, 10:25 - Cindy L: <Media omitted>
5/1/16, 10:25 - Cindy L: See these are the core for ucl biomed sciences
5/1/16, 10:26 - Cindy L: My point is that they do biochem and human physio in first yr
5/1/16, 10:27 - Cindy L: And then yr 2 do nerves and pharmacology
5/1/16, 10:29 - Cindy L: And u can do immunology and drug design by yr 3
5/1/16, 10:30 - Cindy L: Well I guess it's sort of similar but there's more neuro options.
5/1/16, 10:31 - Cindy L: But I'll also hv to do med physics or stats stream
5/1/16, 10:32 - Cindy L: <Media omitted>
5/1/16, 10:32 - Cindy L: Unless I manage to completely switch to biomed once I get in
5/1/16, 10:32 - Cindy L: But that's another story
5/1/16, 10:33 - Cindy L: And they still treat u like shit.
5/1/16, 10:34 - Mom: u don't have ib bio and chem, i think that wud be rlly difficult to change to dept of life sci
5/1/16, 10:34 - Cindy L: Yea now I think abt it
5/1/16, 10:34 - Cindy L: It's kinda crazy to do pharmo without chem.
5/1/16, 10:35 - Cindy L: Ib chem does not cover that much u know
5/1/16, 10:35 - Cindy L: I bought a book and it's only abt the first 10%
5/1/16, 10:35 - Cindy L: Half of the stuff is the molecular and atomic calculations I already did in physics as well.
5/1/16, 10:36 - Mom: the point is u actually don't have any chem background after gcse
5/1/16, 10:36 - Cindy L: That's why I was gonna do the summer course.
5/1/16, 10:36 - Mom: i know
5/1/16, 10:36 - Cindy L: And chem is not math, u can learn it pretty quickly.
5/1/16, 10:37 - Cindy L: Okay seems like the nu pre reqs are more reasonable now.
5/1/16, 10:37 - Mom: but if u want to do biomed, u have to change to life sci dept?
5/1/16, 10:37 - Mom: is this possible?
5/1/16, 10:37 - Cindy L: It's the biomed dept
5/1/16, 10:37 - Cindy L: Dunno
5/1/16, 10:38 - Cindy L: Anything and nothing can happen in there
5/1/16, 10:38 - Cindy L: Nu would be the safer choice.
5/1/16, 10:40 - Cindy L: I was thinking if I major in biol sci and minor in chem that would be enough science background to do BME at masters level.
5/1/16, 10:41 - Mom: engrg?
5/1/16, 10:41 - Cindy L: Since after that it would just be matter of doing the professional and design courses
5/1/16, 10:41 - Cindy L: Biomed engineering
5/1/16, 10:42 - Cindy L: Hottest engineering discipline right now
5/1/16, 10:43 - Mom: for the ucl biomed course, do u mean B990?
5/1/16, 10:43 - Cindy L: Yes
5/1/16, 10:43 - Cindy L: Then u can do all the life sciences courses u want.
5/1/16, 10:45 - Mom: this's under the life sci faculty, so u have to ask life sci head for change?
5/1/16, 10:45 - Cindy L: I guess
5/1/16, 10:45 - Cindy L: Oh it's under life sciences?
5/1/16, 10:45 - Cindy L: I thought it was its own Dept.
5/1/16, 10:45 - Cindy L: Lse is easy to change course
5/1/16, 10:46 - Cindy L: Since both uol I assume process should be similar?
5/1/16, 10:47 - Cindy L: And realistically speaking if I were to change, I would do so around the end of year 1, sometime near mid lent term
5/1/16, 10:48 - Mom: B990 requires both chem and bio + phy/maths for entry at first yr
5/1/16, 10:48 - Cindy L: Or even year 3
5/1/16, 10:48 - Cindy L: Year 2
5/1/16, 10:48 - Mom: it looks a bit difficult
5/1/16, 10:48 - Cindy L: That's entry requirements
5/1/16, 10:49 - Cindy L: Once u enter, those reqs don't apply.
5/1/16, 10:49 - Mom: but u have to take those chem + bio course starting from yr 1, to fulfill the deg requirement
5/1/16, 10:50 - Mom: so approval at the start of the program looks reasonable
5/1/16, 10:50 - Mom: otherwise, u can't graduate?
5/1/16, 10:50 - Cindy L: I'm assuming most of the core courses I do in Nat sci would be similar.
5/1/16, 10:50 - Mom: don't think so
5/1/16, 10:50 - Mom: cuz core courses r maths based
5/1/16, 10:51 - Mom: and for the second term of yr 1, u've to choose streams according to the term calendar at natural sci course
5/1/16, 10:51 - Cindy L: Wait wait
5/1/16, 10:52 - Cindy L: Where r u looking at?
5/1/16, 10:52 - Mom: ucl website
5/1/16, 10:52 - Mom: and rmb that ur offered a place at natural sci programme
5/1/16, 10:53 - Cindy L: Yes I know
5/1/16, 10:53 - Cindy L: But under natsci there is a biomed stream
5/1/16, 10:53 - Cindy L: OK fair enough, even if u  can't switch to full biomed
5/1/16, 10:54 - Cindy L: Biomed and med physics is still a strong combination
5/1/16, 10:54 - Mom: CFG0 which is run by faculty of physics and maths
5/1/16, 10:54 - Cindy L: Yea but it's not taught by the faculty of physics and maths
5/1/16, 10:54 - Mom: i know
5/1/16, 10:54 - Cindy L: U just attend the biomed classes.
5/1/16, 10:55 - Mom: but the content of biomed stream is exactly as that under B990?
5/1/16, 10:55 - Cindy L: No only a few
5/1/16, 10:55 - Mom: yea, only a few
5/1/16, 10:55 - Cindy L: Like first yr b990 u need 7 required coursrs
5/1/16, 10:56 - Cindy L: Three of them r in Nat sci biomed stream
5/1/16, 10:56 - Cindy L: Which ofc makes sense cuz its only half a biomed course
5/1/16, 10:56 - Mom: that mean u might not be qualified for further studies at medical area after ur natural sci deg?
5/1/16, 10:56 - Cindy L: No u cover the absolute fundamentals.
5/1/16, 10:57 - Cindy L: There's anatomy, genetics, pharma, physiology, biochem
5/1/16, 10:57 - Cindy L: In the natsci stream
5/1/16, 10:57 - Cindy L: Just don't do much cell bio
5/1/16, 10:57 - Cindy L: But u could take it under option.
5/1/16, 10:58 - Cindy L: Not much chem though thats for sure, so a reasonable concern would be that the later courses would be really hard
5/1/16, 10:58 - Cindy L: Cuz u don't hv the Chem foundation
5/1/16, 10:59 - Cindy L: Maybe a better stream would be organic chem and biomed
5/1/16, 11:00 - Cindy L: But I heard organic chem is  much stricter with reqs
5/1/16, 11:01 - Mom: it looks like nu is a safer choice bc u hv the choice
5/1/16, 11:02 - Mom: i just read ucl natural sci career choice after graduation, it says nothing abt the medical path
5/1/16, 11:03 - Mom: only the med related techology
5/1/16, 11:03 - Mom: those r allied health, teaching, med journalism
5/1/16, 12:23 - Cindy L: Cuz u need a further med degree for tht?
5/1/16, 12:38 - Mom: no, i mean u can't do medical stuff
5/1/16, 12:38 - Mom: just med technical
5/1/16, 12:39 - Mom: btw, why u didn't apply bme when u applied for transfer to nu?
5/1/16, 12:44 - Mom: to remind u that u must attend the lse exam bc those results still count for further studies
5/1/16, 13:33 - Cindy L: Yes I know
5/1/16, 13:33 - Cindy L: Nu switch to engineering is easy
5/1/16, 13:33 - Cindy L: Bme can only minor
5/1/16, 13:33 - Cindy L: At nu
5/1/16, 13:34 - Cindy L: I am revising everyday.
5/1/16, 13:34 - Cindy L: I plan to ace the math so I can skip 220 and 230
5/1/16, 13:51 - Mom: so that Janet Chen also minor bme?
5/1/16, 14:20 - Cindy L: Yah I think so
5/1/16, 14:20 - Cindy L: I'll check
5/1/16, 14:24 - Cindy L: Should I still go to California though
5/1/16, 14:25 - Mom: u decide la
5/1/16, 14:25 - Mom: is that chem useful?
5/1/16, 14:25 - Cindy L: I was thinking of how many credits I could transfer
5/1/16, 14:25 - Cindy L: Max 8.
5/1/16, 14:25 - Mom: chem only I think if nu allow
5/1/16, 14:25 - Mom: how 8 units?
5/1/16, 14:25 - Cindy L: From lse I mean
5/1/16, 14:25 - Mom: ic
5/1/16, 14:26 - Cindy L: Thats not even a year
5/1/16, 14:26 - Mom: those r for maths and general core requirements only but not chem or bio
5/1/16, 14:26 - Cindy L: They do 4 courses per quarter so that 12 units a year
5/1/16, 14:26 - Mom: yea, i know
5/1/16, 14:26 - Cindy L: Yea but u need credits to graduate
5/1/16, 14:27 - Mom: total credits not a prob
5/1/16, 14:27 - Mom: it's rather the major pre-requisite
5/1/16, 14:27 - Cindy L: I got three years there so that's 12*3= 36
5/1/16, 14:27 - Cindy L: I need 9 more.
5/1/16, 14:27 - Mom: plus summer?
5/1/16, 14:28 - Cindy L: so that means I'll have to do at least a Summer there
5/1/16, 14:28 - Mom: can u do more than 12 every quarter
5/1/16, 14:28 - Cindy L: They do 4 courses a quarter
5/1/16, 14:29 - Mom: yea i know
5/1/16, 14:29 - Cindy L: 5 courses is probably max, or else the workload gets too much
5/1/16, 14:29 - Cindy L: People don't have time to do part time so that says something already
5/1/16, 14:30 - Mom: just for 1 or 2 quarters only, not for the three yrs
5/1/16, 14:30 - Cindy L: I know lah
5/1/16, 14:30 - Cindy L: So it's same as here
5/1/16, 14:30 - Mom: does nu hv summer course?
5/1/16, 14:30 - Cindy L: Yea they run summer sessions
5/1/16, 14:30 - Mom: how abt shift there to do summer course
5/1/16, 14:31 - Cindy L: Don't think it's for visiting students
5/1/16, 14:31 - Mom: summer courses r for visiting students only?
5/1/16, 14:31 - Cindy L: I mean not for non nu students
5/1/16, 14:31 - Mom: current student not possible?
5/1/16, 14:32 - Mom: but ur coming nu students?
5/1/16, 14:32 - Mom: either do 1 summer session next summer
5/1/16, 14:33 - Mom: u can have enough credits for graduation la
5/1/16, 14:33 - Cindy L: Yea I think summer session next year is better
5/1/16, 14:33 - Mom: so what abt ucb?
5/1/16, 14:33 - Mom: go or not go?
5/1/16, 14:34 - Mom: if go, might be too much and not of much use
5/1/16, 14:34 - Cindy L: No? Cuz i can only get I credit from the chem course?
5/1/16, 14:34 - Mom: exactly
5/1/16, 14:35 - Mom: 1 credit = 1 course? towards graduation degree?
5/1/16, 14:35 - Cindy L: I can try learning chem 101 and test out of that though
5/1/16, 14:35 - Mom: do they allow it?
5/1/16, 14:35 - Cindy L: But I can do that at home... üòì
5/1/16, 14:35 - Cindy L: They hv placement test
5/1/16, 14:35 - Cindy L: But I heard chem is notoriously hard.
5/1/16, 14:36 - Cindy L: Like econ here I guess.
5/1/16, 14:36 - Cindy L: Econ here is pretty hard.
5/1/16, 14:36 - Mom: that's bc u didn't have any prior knowledge b4
5/1/16, 14:36 - Mom: and econ at lse is no.1
5/1/16, 14:37 - Cindy L: I mean other people who do econ find it hard too
5/1/16, 14:37 - Mom: what do u think lse is ?
5/1/16, 14:37 - Mom: why it ranks world top?
5/1/16, 14:37 - Cindy L: Oh and the teaching can be very bad.

5/1/16, 14:42 - Cindy L: So that was quite interesting

5/1/16, 16:45 - Mom: if too much, i'll have to check with the seafarer
5/1/16, 17:06 - Cindy L: Noooo
5/1/16, 17:07 - Cindy L: No way, it will be so expensive to mail back

5/1/16, 17:25 - Cindy L: Ah whatever we'll see.
5/1/16, 17:25 - Cindy L: And then I need to find something else to do over the summer.
5/1/16, 17:41 - Mom: determined not going to ucb?
5/1/16, 17:42 - Mom: and the clothing rack can be dismantled and pack them together with ur other stuff la bc ur going to send back other items
5/1/16, 18:33 - Cindy L: Yea I think I might cancel the ucb thing.
5/1/16, 18:37 - Mom: oh
5/1/16, 18:38 - Mom: check with the financial aid at nu if ur free
5/1/16, 20:20 - Cindy L: Yea OK. I heard they r generous
5/1/16, 20:21 - Cindy L: But not sure if this is only for americans
5/1/16, 20:21 - Cindy L: They r filthy rich though as a school
5/1/16, 20:40 - Cindy L: I've been wondering if I hv actually switched to polyphasic sleeping
5/1/16, 20:42 - Cindy L: Looking at the frequency of the daytime naps, there's a sign of rem around every four hours
5/1/16, 22:42 - Mom: still sleep like polyphasic?
5/1/16, 22:43 - Mom: The means u sleep 6 times s day?
5/1/16, 23:02 - Cindy L: Over a 24 hr period yeah pretty much.
5/1/16, 23:02 - Cindy L: More than 6 times, but u get the point
5/1/16, 23:03 - Mom: This is rather annoying sleep do many times
5/1/16, 23:04 - Mom: *so
5/1/16, 23:04 - Cindy L: I hv incredible focus though
5/1/16, 23:04 - Cindy L: Cuz I hv to take advantage of all the non sleeping time I havr
5/1/16, 23:07 - Mom: slept for long time every sleep block or just short duration?
5/1/16, 23:07 - Mom: tbh, u didn't have focus prob before
5/1/16, 23:08 - Cindy L: That's true, I am not a procrastinator
5/1/16, 23:08 - Cindy L: Procrastination is a sign of depression
5/1/16, 23:09 - Cindy L: I think
5/1/16, 23:09 - Mom: rlly?
5/1/16, 23:09 - Cindy L: Max around 2-3 hr during night
5/1/16, 23:09 - Cindy L: Morning: 20-30 most freq
5/1/16, 23:10 - Cindy L: But can range from 20-50 min
5/1/16, 23:10 - Cindy L: U hate what u're doing, that's why u procrastinate. U hate life, u procrastinate all the time.
5/1/16, 23:11 - Mom: so u had depression at kgv? cuz u always hated to be there b4
5/1/16, 23:12 - Mom: and how long the total time in a day?
5/1/16, 23:15 - Mom: the critical point is whether ur refreshed after these polyphasic sleep schedules
5/1/16, 23:54 - Cindy L: Well I feel refreshed. And my body stops trying to go into rem
5/1/16, 23:54 - Cindy L: So I think it works?
5/1/16, 23:54 - Cindy L: Not sure.
5/1/16, 23:59 - Mom: o
5/1/16, 23:59 - Mom: ok
5/1/16, 23:59 - Mom: sleep time again
5/2/16, 00:53 - Cindy L: <Media omitted>
5/2/16, 04:30 - Cindy L: Financial aid is not offered to international transfer applicants
5/2/16, 04:51 - Cindy L: üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±
5/2/16, 04:52 - Cindy L: I forgot I get hallucinations if I don't sleep for a long time
5/2/16, 04:52 - Cindy L: I just fell asleep on the desk for 20 mins
5/2/16, 04:52 - Cindy L: Last time I slept was 0000
5/2/16, 04:53 - Cindy L: Then while I was sleeping I dreamt i heard on a radio that someone had commit suicide by jumping
5/2/16, 04:54 - Cindy L: And then when I woke up, I heard the scariest laugh ever in the middle of the night.
5/2/16, 04:55 - Cindy L: I heard it loud and clear, it was like hysterical laughter
5/2/16, 04:55 - Cindy L: Maybe smefects of sleep deprivation
5/2/16, 05:41 - Mom: what? nu's website said they did offer scholarship even to international student?
5/2/16, 05:43 - Mom: is that u had a dream inside ur dream?
5/2/16, 05:44 - Mom: and u heard that "laugh" in ur dream having waken up from the inside dream?
5/2/16, 06:00 - Mom: looking back u 1/5 sleep log, u've slept for a total of 11 hrs!!
5/2/16, 06:01 - Mom: u've eaten for dinner only?
5/2/16, 06:02 - Mom: dinner at 1830 or 2130?
5/2/16, 06:02 - Mom: the shaking at 1700 is like going into rem?
5/2/16, 06:02 - Mom: and do u shake everyday?
5/2/16, 07:01 - Cindy L: I don't know where they laUfh came from, I just heard it when the curtains were closed and i was gonna go sleep
5/2/16, 07:02 - Cindy L: I thought it was another crazy London person
5/2/16, 07:03 - Cindy L: Until I pulled back the curtains saw the window was closed.
5/2/16, 07:04 - Cindy L: I swear i heard it really clear, the window could not have been closed
5/2/16, 07:06 - Cindy L: I was AWAKE when I heard it cuz I was standing up packing my stuff
5/2/16, 07:07 - Cindy L: In my my mind, I sort of had the idea that there was a suicide
5/2/16, 07:09 - Cindy L: That suddenly sounded quite strange, so I put two and two together and realised that it could have been a hallucination
5/2/16, 07:10 - Cindy L: I freaked the hell out, cuz I didn't know if I was gonna get anymore of them
5/2/16, 07:10 - Cindy L: So I quickly went to sleep
5/2/16, 07:11 - Cindy L: I just woke up from a nightmare
5/2/16, 07:12 - Cindy L: Paralysis was much more intense and it was much more difficult to physically get up and wake up from the nightmare
5/2/16, 07:13 - Cindy L: Also less awareness of it as a dream
5/2/16, 07:19 - Mom: so u heard the laugh when u were packing stuff, not lying on bed?
5/2/16, 07:33 - Mom: "That suddenly sounded quite strange, so I put two and two together and realised that it could have been a hallucination" what does this mean? don't understand
5/2/16, 07:36 - Mom: "Also less awareness of it as a dream"? if u didn't aware that as a dream, what's in ur mind at that time?
5/2/16, 08:49 - Cindy L: Before I got up and started packing my stuff up on the desk, I had fell asleep there for 20min, I had a vague dream where I heard abt a suicide
5/2/16, 08:51 - Mom: but u said u slept at 0000?
5/2/16, 08:51 - Cindy L: So when I was AWAKE and heard the laugh at 4:30 am. I assumed it was a drunk person, cuz I couldn't see outside the window.
5/2/16, 08:51 - Mom: so u fell asleep on the desk at 0000? or 04xx?
5/2/16, 08:52 - Mom: is that "laugh" sound a man or a woman?
5/2/16, 08:52 - Cindy L: I slept once for 20min at 0000, I was still at the library at 12
5/2/16, 08:52 - Cindy L: Man
5/2/16, 08:52 - Cindy L: Crazy though
5/2/16, 08:52 - Cindy L: Definitely
5/2/16, 08:52 - Mom: perhaps that's just someone outside on the street?
5/2/16, 08:53 - Cindy L: Maybe
5/2/16, 08:53 - Cindy L: But the window was closed.
5/2/16, 08:53 - Mom: cuz sound might be heard even with window closed
5/2/16, 08:53 - Cindy L: The sound shouldn't hv been that clear.
5/2/16, 08:53 - Cindy L: Anyways apart from that.
5/2/16, 08:53 - Mom: but that window isn't a sound proof window?
5/2/16, 08:54 - Cindy L: It was really clear, like the person was in the room
5/2/16, 08:54 - Mom: oh, u said u tested that were hallucination? how did u test?
5/2/16, 08:55 - Cindy L: Tested?
5/2/16, 08:55 - Cindy L: Never said that
5/2/16, 08:56 - Mom: That suddenly sounded quite strange, so I put two and two together and realised that it could have been a hallucination - see 0709
5/2/16, 08:56 - Cindy L: That's not a test
5/2/16, 08:56 - Cindy L: TThats a moment of realisation
5/2/16, 08:57 - Mom: so u thought that laugh is hallucination, right?
5/2/16, 08:57 - Cindy L: ....
5/2/16, 08:57 - Cindy L: I don't know
5/2/16, 08:57 - Cindy L: I didn't knkw
5/2/16, 08:57 - Cindy L: I still don't know
5/2/16, 08:57 - Mom: other than this, did u feel anything?
5/2/16, 08:57 - Mom: like someone drag on ur body?
5/2/16, 08:58 - Cindy L: But let's say I was reminded that at this point I was very prone to scary hallucinations/ dreams
5/2/16, 08:59 - Cindy L: So I couldn't decide whether to go to sleep or stay awake and wait until dawn
5/2/16, 08:59 - Mom: u didn't sleep after that?
5/2/16, 08:59 - Cindy L: I chose to go to sleep
5/2/16, 08:59 - Cindy L: So I got a nightmare
5/2/16, 08:59 - Cindy L: As expected
5/2/16, 08:59 - Mom: poor....
5/2/16, 08:59 - Cindy L: Not really bad one though
5/2/16, 09:00 - Cindy L: Not fully blown SP
5/2/16, 09:00 - Mom: rmb that nightmare?
5/2/16, 09:00 - Cindy L: Yea I wrote abt it
5/2/16, 09:01 - Mom: what is it?
5/2/16, 09:02 - Cindy L: OK I thought I had wrote abt it
5/2/16, 09:02 - Cindy L: Now I hv to try remember
5/2/16, 09:02 - Cindy L: Rifles
5/2/16, 09:02 - Cindy L: Shooting elephants
5/2/16, 09:03 - Cindy L: Comedians forcing me to shoot elephants with a shotgun
5/2/16, 09:03 - Cindy L: And bbeing shot in general
5/2/16, 09:03 - Cindy L: Actually I don't remember
5/2/16, 09:04 - Cindy L: Just lots of stuff which I would usually associate with funny stuff turned into scary stuff.
5/2/16, 09:05 - Cindy L: Oh and I couldn't wake up
5/2/16, 09:07 - Cindy L: That kind of situation where I'm always screaming for help and I hear somebody outside but they can't hear me
5/2/16, 09:08 - Cindy L: Oh they were fake bullets at first until someone shot a real one.
5/2/16, 09:08 - Cindy L: And then all hell broke loose
5/2/16, 09:10 - Cindy L: I think I also sort of woke up in the dream from a dream as well....
5/2/16, 09:11 - Mom: anybody dead?
5/2/16, 09:11 - Cindy L: No
5/2/16, 09:11 - Cindy L: The dream with the suicide is supposed to be scarier if u think abt it
5/2/16, 09:12 - Cindy L: I wasn't exactly fully asleep
5/2/16, 09:13 - Cindy L: I thought a girl had just commit suicide nearby by jumping
5/2/16, 09:14 - Cindy L: But I didn't think much of it
5/2/16, 09:14 - Cindy L: I didn't even know that wasn't true until o started thinking back, realizing I had actually went into rem during my 20min nap
5/2/16, 09:17 - Mom: this girl suicide dream is rlly scary
5/2/16, 09:18 - Mom: ok la, forget that dream
5/2/16, 09:18 - Mom: otherwise, ur emotion wud be srsly affected
5/2/16, 09:19 - Mom: i rmb that u didn't have this kind of nightmare for quite a time right?
5/2/16, 09:19 - Mom: will that be the exam pressure?
5/2/16, 09:21 - Cindy L: No this is even chiller than normal
5/2/16, 09:22 - Cindy L: It's just I thought I might try to see when my body goes to sleep yesterday
5/2/16, 09:23 - Cindy L: And I discovered it doesnt and instead hallucinates like crazy if I don't sleep
5/2/16, 09:25 - Mom: sorry, what do u mean by "try to see when my body goes to sleep yesterday"?
5/2/16, 09:25 - Cindy L: See the weird thing is I didn't find the one with the suicide scary
5/2/16, 09:25 - Mom: don't get it
5/2/16, 09:26 - Cindy L: I found the funny things scary
5/2/16, 09:26 - Cindy L: Like the Laugh
5/2/16, 09:26 - Cindy L: And there was a comedian in my nightmare
5/2/16, 09:26 - Mom: a man?
5/2/16, 09:27 - Cindy L: Yes
5/2/16, 09:27 - Mom: so laugh = comedian?
5/2/16, 09:27 - Cindy L: No
5/2/16, 09:27 - Cindy L: They r like separate things man
5/2/16, 09:31 - Cindy L: My greatest fear is loosing my phone before I can backup this chat.
5/2/16, 09:35 - Mom: loosing ur phone? also a dream?
5/2/16, 10:04 - Cindy L: No this is a real fear.
5/2/16, 10:13 - Mom: ur srsly panaoid
5/2/16, 10:15 - Cindy L: Thanks we've established that
5/2/16, 10:16 - Cindy L: OK I don't think polyphasic is possible.
5/2/16, 10:16 - Cindy L: Or u need at least one block of core sleep to be sane.
5/2/16, 10:18 - Mom: ofc
5/2/16, 13:38 - Cindy L: <Media omitted>
5/2/16, 13:47 - Mom: earthworm?
5/2/16, 13:57 - Cindy L: Shit I write when I'm high
5/2/16, 13:58 - Cindy L: I feel like crap today.
5/2/16, 14:16 - Mom: i thought u were sleepy at that time?
5/2/16, 14:17 - Mom: u didn't sleep well last night, how can u function properly!
5/2/16, 14:17 - Mom: can u go back ur dorm and sleep for few hrs?
5/2/16, 14:58 - Cindy L: I'm in the dorm
5/2/16, 14:58 - Cindy L: There's no seats in the library in the morning
5/2/16, 14:59 - Mom: i thought u were in the lesson when u showed me the animal wrting
5/2/16, 15:00 - Cindy L: I wasn't in lesson.
5/2/16, 15:00 - Cindy L: Those were my math notes.
5/2/16, 15:01 - Cindy L: I'm showing u the crap I end up writing when I try to do math in a rem session.
5/2/16, 15:01 - Cindy L: I literally have no idea what I'm doing.
5/2/16, 15:01 - Mom: take a longer nap/rest
5/2/16, 15:02 - Mom: have lunch already?
5/2/16, 17:34 - Mom: hi, how u feel now?
5/2/16, 17:58 - Cindy L: I finally fell asleep in the kitchen for abt an hr
5/2/16, 17:59 - Cindy L: The back of my head had been hurting for the whole morning
5/2/16, 17:59 - Cindy L: So I went out to Sainsbury
5/2/16, 17:59 - Cindy L: It stopped hurting but I felt really tired and sudden went into a really bad mood
5/2/16, 18:01 - Cindy L: So I went back had lunch and fell asleep on the kitchen table
5/2/16, 18:02 - Cindy L: The Indian girl woke me up like 15 mins ago and when I woke up the back of my head was hurting like mad.
5/2/16, 18:03 - Cindy L: Now it is gone, and I actually don't remember much after immediately after I woke up and I had to go ask her just now.
5/2/16, 18:03 - Mom: i think it's the position u put ur head on the kitchen table that hurts ur head
5/2/16, 18:03 - Mom: ru ok now? no more pain?
5/2/16, 18:04 - Mom: next time, go back to sleep on ur bed if possible
5/2/16, 18:12 - Cindy L: So basically I think the main problem is ventilation
5/2/16, 18:13 - Cindy L: I haven't been reporting as much nightmares for the past two or three weeks cuz I've been spending everyday in the library instead of staying in holborn.
5/2/16, 18:14 - Cindy L: Something abt indoor air messes with my head.
5/2/16, 18:15 - Cindy L: Could be lack of oxygen but it doesn't really make much sense because u only need 20% and it's not like everything is completely sealed here.
5/2/16, 18:15 - Mom: so always keep ur window opened even during night time sleeping
5/2/16, 18:15 - Cindy L: Too much carbon dioxide?
5/2/16, 18:15 - Cindy L: I already do
5/2/16, 18:15 - Cindy L: It's cold as fuck
5/2/16, 18:16 - Cindy L: Something in the indoor air makes me hallucinate like a hippy
5/2/16, 18:16 - Mom: if u stay indoor like ur dorm for the whole day, probably insufficient oxygen
5/2/16, 18:16 - Cindy L: Probably.... I don't know, it's not terribly convincing
5/2/16, 18:16 - Mom: have u ever hallucinated in the street or in the lib?
5/2/16, 18:16 - Cindy L: No
5/2/16, 18:17 - Mom: try stay outside
5/2/16, 18:17 - Cindy L: The bottom floor on the library is extremely well ventilated
5/2/16, 18:17 - Cindy L: Cuz there's no ceiling.
5/2/16, 18:17 - Cindy L: So I can focus and work for long time no problem.
5/2/16, 18:17 - Mom: it maybe the ventilation in ur room too bad
5/2/16, 18:18 - Cindy L: Which brings me to my other point.
5/2/16, 18:18 - Mom: go there la and stay long time
5/2/16, 18:18 - Cindy L: What the hell happened today
5/2/16, 18:18 - Cindy L: I know I slept at 4 something.
5/2/16, 18:19 - Cindy L: But It's not that extreme for my body to go into so much wreakage
5/2/16, 18:19 - Cindy L: I've slept at around 03:30 and woke up fine the next day.
5/2/16, 18:20 - Mom: ur slept at 4 mid-night?
5/2/16, 18:21 - Cindy L: Omg do we have to go through this again
5/2/16, 18:21 - Mom: no
5/2/16, 18:21 - Cindy L: We already did this this morning when my head was in pain.
5/2/16, 18:21 - Mom: just confirm if ur talking abt the afternoon nap
5/2/16, 18:22 - Mom: but u had very bad nightmares last night, might be this is the reason u turned into so much moody
5/2/16, 18:22 - Cindy L: Not really
5/2/16, 18:22 - Cindy L: On a scale of 1-10 I would say they were abt a 6
5/2/16, 18:22 - Mom: when u said u slept at 0330 and still can wake up well, did u have similar nightmares for the whole night?
5/2/16, 18:22 - Cindy L: In terms of scariness
5/2/16, 18:23 - Cindy L: Sometimes
5/2/16, 18:23 - Cindy L: Before, the general trend uses to be that the later I slept the more weird things will happen to me.
5/2/16, 18:24 - Cindy L: Now I wouldn't say the same. I dunno.
5/2/16, 18:27 - Cindy L: And the headache.
5/2/16, 18:27 - Cindy L: Never had that bad of a headache before
5/2/16, 18:28 - Mom: sigh...
5/2/16, 18:28 - Cindy L: Esp back of the head
5/2/16, 18:28 - Mom: the pons
5/2/16, 18:28 - Cindy L: Surprisingly I still tried to do math this morning
5/2/16, 18:28 - Mom: but u can't right?
5/2/16, 18:29 - Cindy L: Yea I can't cuz I can't write.
5/2/16, 18:29 - Mom: can't write?
5/2/16, 18:29 - Cindy L: Motor control
5/2/16, 18:29 - Mom: sorry, how can't write?
5/2/16, 18:29 - Mom: can't hold the pen?
5/2/16, 18:29 - Cindy L: I can't control where the pen goes.
5/2/16, 18:29 - Cindy L: That's why I show u all the abstract art
5/2/16, 18:30 - Cindy L: All the squiggles
5/2/16, 18:30 - Mom: the animal behavior this morning?
5/2/16, 18:30 - Cindy L: Yah, hah the animal behavior is interesting
5/2/16, 18:30 - Mom: but there're still normal formulas
5/2/16, 18:30 - Cindy L: Cuz I don't know why I wrote that
5/2/16, 18:31 - Mom: u wrote that?
5/2/16, 18:31 - Mom: i was thinking if ur class teacher mark on it?
5/2/16, 18:31 - Cindy L: .... I told u I was doing math this morning. I wrote all of that
5/2/16, 18:32 - Mom: to me, those maths equations/computations r normal
5/2/16, 18:32 - Cindy L: I find it very difficult to do even easy tasks when my brain goes crazy
5/2/16, 18:33 - Cindy L: Yea cuz not all of them were done while my brain was fried
5/2/16, 18:33 - Cindy L: All the stuff below the scribbles is after I 'cleared out' and woke up
5/2/16, 18:33 - Cindy L: Regained control
5/2/16, 18:33 - Mom: sorry when u said ur brain goes crazy, u mean headache, brain fog or having hallucinations?
5/2/16, 18:34 - Cindy L: Maybe brain fog?
5/2/16, 18:34 - Cindy L: Not headache or hallucination
5/2/16, 18:34 - Mom: or u don't even know what ur brain is doing at that moment?
5/2/16, 18:34 - Cindy L: Yea I have no idea what I am doing during that moment.
5/2/16, 18:35 - Cindy L: Nooo that's confusing if I say that
5/2/16, 18:35 - Cindy L: Start again
5/2/16, 18:35 - Cindy L: It's like
5/2/16, 18:35 - Cindy L: I can sort of understand what to do
5/2/16, 18:35 - Mom: u still can move ur body, just can't control them as u wish?
5/2/16, 18:36 - Cindy L: But I can't concentrate enough to form the necessary links between the information I need in my head
5/2/16, 18:36 - Mom: this is even weird
5/2/16, 18:36 - Cindy L: So I was differentiating
5/2/16, 18:37 - Cindy L: I know the rules and how to differentiate and everything
5/2/16, 18:37 - Cindy L: I cant focus enough to apply them to the current question.
5/2/16, 18:37 - Cindy L: It's feels more like a focus thing.
5/2/16, 18:37 - Cindy L: Or maybe not.
5/2/16, 18:37 - Mom: add?
5/2/16, 18:38 - Cindy L: I just can't seem to do something.
5/2/16, 18:38 - Cindy L: And I can't write properly
5/2/16, 18:38 - Cindy L: Do I spend the whole time trying to rewrite the math nicely
5/2/16, 18:39 - Cindy L: And then I sort of forget what I was doing once I manage to do so.
5/2/16, 18:39 - Cindy L: I'll show u a better example of abstract art
5/2/16, 18:39 - Mom: to me, u tried to do that maths but later found out incorrect and redo it again
5/2/16, 18:40 - Cindy L: <Media omitted>
5/2/16, 18:40 - Cindy L: OK this is a better example
5/2/16, 18:40 - Cindy L: I was trying to draw a table.
5/2/16, 18:41 - Cindy L: That's like elementary school stuff right
5/2/16, 18:41 - Mom: this looks like u were sleeping but still try to do things
5/2/16, 18:41 - Cindy L: OK I guess to third party onlookers that's what I look like
5/2/16, 18:42 - Cindy L: That's why they all said I was just sleeping in math
5/2/16, 18:42 - Mom: yea, that's the sleeping quality not elementary work
5/2/16, 18:42 - Cindy L: But in my head I was still trying to do math
5/2/16, 18:43 - Cindy L: I spend in average at least an hr in that state everyday
5/2/16, 18:43 - Cindy L: Continuously
5/2/16, 18:43 - Mom: is this the same case as in yr13?
5/2/16, 18:43 - Mom: every maths class or even other subj?
5/2/16, 18:43 - Cindy L: Yes, this is what I hv been trying to explain to people
5/2/16, 18:44 - Cindy L: For the past two yrs
5/2/16, 18:44 - Cindy L: So far I'm still stuck in a glass box
5/2/16, 18:44 - Cindy L: Or more like a black box
5/2/16, 18:45 - Mom: u said u were trying to do maths at that moment, but in the end sleep right?
5/2/16, 18:45 - Cindy L: No, not exactly
5/2/16, 18:45 - Cindy L: I don't realise I fall asleep
5/2/16, 18:45 - Cindy L: That's why I continue to do math for the hour
5/2/16, 18:45 - Cindy L: And then suddenly
5/2/16, 18:45 - Cindy L: I 'wake up'
5/2/16, 18:45 - Cindy L: Just by itself
5/2/16, 18:46 - Cindy L: Like the rem sessions, I just suddenly stop shaking and I can control my body again.
5/2/16, 18:46 - Cindy L: It's not like I feel very tired but I still want to work
5/2/16, 18:46 - Cindy L: Nonono
5/2/16, 18:47 - Cindy L: More like ready to do math and start working on it, suddenly find myself stuck on a early supposedly easy question for the next hr.
5/2/16, 18:47 - Cindy L: See why I didn't ask for help
5/2/16, 18:48 - Mom: how did u classmates say this when they saw u? sleeping or not sleeping?
5/2/16, 18:48 - Cindy L: They said I was dozing.
5/2/16, 18:48 - Cindy L: Like nodding off
5/2/16, 18:49 - Cindy L: It was ib, everyone was tired and sleep deprived so nobody said anything.
5/2/16, 18:49 - Mom: if u were dozing for an hr, u can't even write any words?
5/2/16, 18:49 - Mom: but that pic isn't rlly that bad
5/2/16, 18:50 - Mom: yea, that maths table is like somebody is sleeping but not reasonable dozing for like an hr
5/2/16, 18:51 - Mom: does it happen only in maths? not other subj?
5/2/16, 18:52 - Cindy L: No just math
5/2/16, 18:52 - Cindy L: I think math just uses different part of the brain
5/2/16, 18:54 - Cindy L: Can't seem to do logic.
5/2/16, 18:55 - Mom: but as u said it's not the application prob, rather the concentration/focus prob?
5/2/16, 18:55 - Cindy L: Hmmm lemme think
5/2/16, 18:56 - Cindy L: It's hard to describe too cuz I don't really know what's going on and I can't remember most of it.
5/2/16, 18:56 - Cindy L: I also have a feeling it might have to do with memory
5/2/16, 18:56 - Mom: sometimes, it's like a student doesn't rlly understand the subj well so he can't apply the theory to question
5/2/16, 18:56 - Cindy L: No
5/2/16, 18:57 - Mom: i was just saying from my observation of those work, it looks like that
5/2/16, 18:57 - Cindy L: More like when u recognize a word, but u can't say it.
5/2/16, 18:58 - Mom: so i had asked u if u had prob with the maths?
5/2/16, 18:58 - Cindy L: No evidently not because I did manage to get a six in hl math
5/2/16, 18:58 - Mom: that's the cognition prob?
5/2/16, 18:59 - Cindy L: Maybe?
5/2/16, 18:59 - Cindy L: Rem is triggered by prefrontal cortex
5/2/16, 18:59 - Cindy L: No sorry that nrem
5/2/16, 19:00 - Mom: rem shud be triggered somewhere at the pons
5/2/16, 19:01 - Cindy L: I can only say it's like I'm out of it
5/2/16, 19:01 - Cindy L: Like I know I need to move the blocks from a to b
5/2/16, 19:01 - Mom: like being possessed?
5/2/16, 19:01 - Cindy L: But I can't do so.
5/2/16, 19:02 - Cindy L: I don't know what being possesses feels like.
5/2/16, 19:03 - Mom: feels like ur soul is out of ur body, hovering above and u saw something happened and want to tell ur body to react but can't
5/2/16, 19:03 - Cindy L: No it's not an oob
5/2/16, 19:04 - Mom: i'll google it tmr
5/2/16, 19:04 - Cindy L: Out of body
5/2/16, 19:05 - Mom: feel better now? no more head hurt?
5/2/16, 19:05 - Cindy L: No but I don't know what to do
5/2/16, 19:05 - Cindy L: Do math I guess.
5/2/16, 19:05 - Mom: can u do maths now?
5/2/16, 19:05 - Cindy L: I think so I don't know
5/2/16, 19:06 - Cindy L: I pretty much don't work in my room anymore cuz I can't do anything here.
5/2/16, 19:06 - Mom: those thing happened only in the morning?
5/2/16, 19:06 - Cindy L: What thing?
5/2/16, 19:07 - Mom: i mean unable to focus
5/2/16, 19:07 - Cindy L: When I just start to work
5/2/16, 19:07 - Mom: and dozing off at maths class
5/2/16, 19:07 - Cindy L: Or post meal
5/2/16, 19:07 - Mom: every time starting to work?
5/2/16, 19:07 - Cindy L: In the beginning, I had that in every single class.
5/2/16, 19:07 - Cindy L: Not everytime
5/2/16, 19:08 - Cindy L: Post meal is more regular
5/2/16, 19:08 - Cindy L: Esp post noodles or sandwiches
5/2/16, 19:09 - Mom: "In the beginning, I had that in every single class." do u mean situation improve
5/2/16, 19:09 - Cindy L: Yeah
5/2/16, 19:10 - Cindy L: I sleep less in lectures and I don't sleep in classes
5/2/16, 19:10 - Cindy L: That is big improvement
5/2/16, 19:10 - Mom: is this the same case in yr13?
5/2/16, 19:11 - Cindy L: In yr13 I started sleeping in math classes first until it got pretty regular that I basically was sleeping every single lesson and then it just move out and happened in all the other classes as well
5/2/16, 19:12 - Cindy L: And then I couldn't even watch a complete movie without falling asleep
5/2/16, 19:12 - Mom: as far as i know, u didn't take drugs/supplements, no exercise and even didn't sleep well at night, why there's improvement?
5/2/16, 19:12 - Cindy L: That's when I sort of lost interest in film cuz basically well I couldn't even sit through a complete film.
5/2/16, 19:13 - Cindy L: I always zoned out or Dell asleep for 5 mins and then I don't know what happened and stuff.
5/2/16, 19:14 - Mom: where? in class or lib, coffee shop?
5/2/16, 19:14 - Cindy L: Talking abt watching a movie.
5/2/16, 19:14 - Mom: oooh
5/2/16, 19:15 - Cindy L: And then I couldn't read more than 10 pages either because I wouldn't remember when my eyes were closed and I started remming.
5/2/16, 19:16 - Mom: take break/rest after reading 10 pages
5/2/16, 19:16 - Cindy L: That is if I can get to page 10
5/2/16, 19:17 - Cindy L: And then I just stopped doing those two things cuz I couldn't do them.
5/2/16, 19:17 - Mom: how many pages u normally can read in an hr?
5/2/16, 19:17 - Cindy L: So I lost all my hobbies and my friends and I fell into depression
5/2/16, 19:18 - Mom: do other stuff ma? like archery, takwondo
5/2/16, 19:20 - Mom: hi, still there?
5/2/16, 19:20 - Cindy L: Sorry.
5/2/16, 19:20 - Mom: doze off?
5/2/16, 19:20 - Cindy L: No
5/2/16, 19:21 - Cindy L: U don't really understand depression do u
5/2/16, 19:21 - Mom: still in depression?
5/2/16, 19:21 - Mom: tbh i never had depression even after giving birth of baby
5/2/16, 19:22 - Cindy L: I think I'm ook
5/2/16, 19:22 - Mom: maybe i never had experienced such great prob in my life
5/2/16, 19:23 - Cindy L: I clawed my way out of depression hell myself
5/2/16, 19:23 - Mom: ru still in depression or just not in a very good mood
5/2/16, 19:24 - Cindy L: I'm ok
5/2/16, 19:24 - Cindy L: I don't think I'm depressed anymore.
5/2/16, 19:24 - Cindy L: Depressed state very prone to addiction
5/2/16, 19:24 - Cindy L: That's problem no. 2
5/2/16, 19:25 - Cindy L: That's the real problem
5/2/16, 19:25 - Cindy L: Cuz that's a biochemical problem
5/2/16, 19:25 - Mom: so u said depression will come back easily
5/2/16, 19:28 - Mom: üëÄ
5/2/16, 19:30 - Cindy L: Yra
5/2/16, 19:30 - Cindy L: Cuz addiction and depression go hand in hand
5/2/16, 19:31 - Cindy L: Well that's what I think
5/2/16, 19:31 - Cindy L: Some papers say there r neurons which can turn off depression
5/2/16, 19:31 - Cindy L: But I think that's for serious cases
5/2/16, 19:31 - Cindy L: Like if u want to kill herself.
5/2/16, 19:32 - Cindy L: Yourself
5/2/16, 19:32 - Cindy L: That's a different thing
5/2/16, 19:39 - Cindy L: Anyways this is a different matter
5/2/16, 19:40 - Cindy L: Question is still why did I get so high yesterday
5/2/16, 19:41 - Mom: high? excited? or depressed?
5/2/16, 19:41 - Mom: lack of sleep the night before?
5/2/16, 19:57 - Cindy L: Go to sleep
5/2/16, 20:00 - Cindy L: I'm gonna accept the nu offer btw
5/2/16, 23:45 - Cindy L: Oh have u received the welcome pack get?

5/3/16, 00:24 - Mom: why not sleep? 12xx
5/3/16, 00:24 - Cindy L: U can do it again if u don't pass
5/3/16, 00:24 - Cindy L: Or get an a*
5/3/16, 00:25 - Mom: don't pass? how abt if she only get an A?
5/3/16, 00:25 - Cindy L: Narumi did it again cuz she didn't get an a*
5/3/16, 00:25 - Cindy L: Or so people say
5/3/16, 00:26 - Mom: ok, let see
5/3/16, 00:26 - Cindy L: Better get a star thought, this is an easy star
5/3/16, 00:26 - Mom: but her bio is rlly bad!!!
5/3/16, 00:26 - Mom: just B
5/3/16, 00:26 - Cindy L: Oh really, why?
5/3/16, 00:27 - Mom: cuz she didn't revise a lot
5/3/16, 00:27 - Mom: and i can't push her
5/3/16, 00:27 - Cindy L: Oh right, Emos is natural genius type
5/3/16, 00:27 - Mom: genius = shit
5/3/16, 00:28 - Cindy L: Natural genius is good
5/3/16, 00:28 - Mom: ha ha ha
5/3/16, 00:28 - Cindy L: But still get beat down by institutional rules at the end of the day ah
5/3/16, 00:28 - Mom: there's no natural genius in this world
5/3/16, 00:28 - Mom: everybody just work hard
5/3/16, 00:29 - Mom: and play hard
5/3/16, 00:29 - Cindy L: There is natural genius ah
5/3/16, 00:29 - Mom: but she work less and play little
5/3/16, 00:29 - Cindy L: Plato says so
5/3/16, 00:29 - Mom: oh, i never heard that
5/3/16, 00:29 - Cindy L: But even genius need to put effort to learn rules of the game
5/3/16, 00:29 - Mom: yea
5/3/16, 00:29 - Cindy L: Machiavelli says so
5/3/16, 00:30 - Mom: üëç
5/3/16, 00:30 - Cindy L: Because at the end of the day, institutional rules determine everythinf
5/3/16, 00:30 - Cindy L: Cindy says so
5/3/16, 00:30 - Mom: looks like u can do ur studies rather good wow
5/3/16, 00:30 - Mom: what's institutional rule?
5/3/16, 00:31 - Cindy L: Rule of the game.
5/3/16, 00:31 - Mom: oh
5/3/16, 00:31 - Cindy L: How things r run
5/3/16, 00:31 - Cindy L: I.e. the law
5/3/16, 00:31 - Mom: well, Emos def knows it very well
5/3/16, 00:31 - Mom: rule of the game = law?
5/3/16, 00:32 - Mom: not exactly
5/3/16, 00:33 - Cindy L: Yea the legal code is a set of rules which governs aspects of life
5/3/16, 00:34 - Mom: that's the theory, but in reality not necessary ma
5/3/16, 00:34 - Mom: in reality, rule of game = power
5/3/16, 00:35 - Cindy L: Yea but u can't go around murdering ppl in a modern society right
5/3/16, 00:35 - Cindy L: Even if u hv power
5/3/16, 00:36 - Mom: why not? if u hv that absolute power
5/3/16, 00:36 - Mom: you can make up ur excuse
5/3/16, 00:36 - Cindy L: Then thats North korea
5/3/16, 00:36 - Cindy L: Not modern society
5/3/16, 00:36 - Cindy L: I thought u were talking abt in reality
5/3/16, 00:36 - Mom: no, that's in China, and appearing in hk
5/3/16, 00:36 - Cindy L: Not hypothetical situations.
5/3/16, 00:37 - Cindy L: OK so ur neighbour has been murdered?

5/3/16, 01:07 - Cindy L: The French people r not bad.

5/3/16, 01:09 - Cindy L: Over public education
5/3/16, 01:09 - Mom: sort of know
5/3/16, 01:09 - Cindy L: The point of education is not to get a job.
5/3/16, 01:10 - Mom: agree
5/3/16, 01:10 - Cindy L: It's to make sure u hv a population who can run a country justly
5/3/16, 01:11 - Mom: but this is also the way a govt(politician) use to reduce unemployment rate to polish up their success
5/3/16, 01:11 - Cindy L: That's problem with the system
5/3/16, 01:12 - Cindy L: Why they need to show success?
5/3/16, 01:12 - Cindy L: Cuz they hv limited terms
5/3/16, 01:12 - Cindy L: They want to be reelectes

5/3/16, 01:12 - Mom: they got to protect themselves and the ones in their political group ma
5/3/16, 01:13 - Cindy L: Then those r economic problems

5/3/16, 01:20 - Mom: well i think this is for the undergrad only
5/3/16, 01:20 - Mom: cuz if ur in graduate skl, u need to do research stuff at ur time
5/3/16, 01:20 - Cindy L: Yeah I think grad is better
5/3/16, 01:20 - Mom: and lse's reputation comes from grad skl right
5/3/16, 01:20 - Cindy L: The attitude is different
5/3/16, 01:21 - Cindy L: Cuz undergrad is annoying, everybody still in HS mood
5/3/16, 01:21 - Mom: lots of well-known uni in us also don't care much abt their undergrad
5/3/16, 01:21 - Cindy L: Yea
5/3/16, 01:21 - Mom: like ucb.... u know
5/3/16, 01:21 - Cindy L: I was gonna say that
5/3/16, 01:22 - Cindy L: Ppl say Harvard undergrad is not good either.
5/3/16, 01:22 - Cindy L: But the thing with us uni is that transfer is easy
5/3/16, 01:22 - Cindy L: So there is always a threat of losing your studenta
5/3/16, 01:22 - Mom: üëç

5/3/16, 15:03 - Cindy L: In soup form, it is especially easy to digest

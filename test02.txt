23/09/2016, 07:57 - Mom: don't worry, those buddhist charms will protect u

23/09/2016, 07:58 - Mom: üò±üò±üò±üò±
23/09/2016, 07:58 - Cindy LEUNG: I feel like this one is similar to the last nightmare I had
23/09/2016, 07:58 - Mom: same nightmare?
23/09/2016, 07:59 - Cindy LEUNG: Once I try to control my actions in the dream, the people turn weird
23/09/2016, 07:59 - Cindy LEUNG: I.e. they sort of stop being people and act like dolls or die in horrible way
23/09/2016, 08:00 - Mom: same group of people?
23/09/2016, 08:01 - Cindy LEUNG: No unknown people
23/09/2016, 08:01 - Mom: actually did they do any harm to u b4 u want to control them?
23/09/2016, 08:01 - Cindy LEUNG: No
23/09/2016, 08:02 - Cindy LEUNG: They act normal
23/09/2016, 08:02 - Cindy LEUNG: Not exactly control them
23/09/2016, 08:02 - Cindy LEUNG: More like once I gain more control over my own actions
23/09/2016, 08:02 - Mom: what if u just do nothing to them, do u think they'll turn into bad things?
23/09/2016, 08:02 - Cindy LEUNG: Dunno
23/09/2016, 08:03 - Cindy LEUNG: I'm guessing this is probably cuz its close to final rem
23/09/2016, 08:03 - Cindy LEUNG: That's why the dream turns lucid?
23/09/2016, 08:04 - Mom: those dreams usually happen b4 u wake up?
23/09/2016, 08:05 - Cindy LEUNG: Yah
23/09/2016, 08:06 - Mom: yea
23/09/2016, 08:07 - Mom: for dream immediate b4 u wake up, ur sensations r most noticeable
23/09/2016, 08:07 - Mom: and that's why u thought they're so real and frightened sometimes
23/09/2016, 08:08 - Mom: nvm, that's normal
23/09/2016, 08:10 - Cindy LEUNG: OK
23/09/2016, 08:10 - Cindy LEUNG: I just thought the content seem to have change
23/09/2016, 08:11 - Mom: how? more down to reality?
23/09/2016, 08:11 - Cindy LEUNG: Before they chase and attack me throughout the whole night
23/09/2016, 08:11 - Cindy LEUNG: Now it's like
23/09/2016, 08:11 - Cindy LEUNG: They r nice people
23/09/2016, 08:12 - Cindy LEUNG: And act like normal people
23/09/2016, 08:13 - Cindy LEUNG: But once I act out of line, they turn into doll-like and decay or just turn unhuman-like
23/09/2016, 08:13 - Mom: if ur haunted, it's the normal progress that those buddhist charms r protecting u
23/09/2016, 08:13 - Cindy LEUNG: ??
23/09/2016, 08:14 - Mom: if not, then ur anxiety level changes
23/09/2016, 08:14 - Cindy LEUNG: I feel like anxiety change is more plausible
23/09/2016, 08:14 - Cindy LEUNG: But of what
23/09/2016, 08:14 - Cindy LEUNG: ü§î
23/09/2016, 08:15 - Mom: cause u understand urself more now
23/09/2016, 08:15 - Cindy LEUNG: I think its partly my fault as well

23/09/2016, 08:15 - Mom: and knows how to deal with difficult situations

26/09/2016, 17:57 - Cindy LEUNG: What is the wattage of our vacuum
26/09/2016, 17:57 - Mom: better to use broom or wet wipe
26/09/2016, 17:57 - Mom: can't rmb
26/09/2016, 17:57 - Mom: like 1600w
26/09/2016, 17:57 - Cindy LEUNG: It says on the vacuum
26/09/2016, 17:58 - Mom: 2000w with turbo
26/09/2016, 17:58 - Cindy LEUNG: Shit
26/09/2016, 17:58 - Cindy LEUNG: That's strong
26/09/2016, 17:59 - Mom: i've watched the video on youtube for those upright VC, they work quite well even with a 600w (they said) Vc
26/09/2016, 18:00 - Cindy LEUNG: Ok
26/09/2016, 18:00 - Mom: but they all sound great

26/09/2016, 18:00 - Mom: i know
26/09/2016, 18:00 - Mom: that's why i recomended those cheap upright VC initially
26/09/2016, 18:01 - Cindy LEUNG: Ok
26/09/2016, 18:01 - Mom: i thought one with 800w is strong enough for suction
26/09/2016, 18:01 - Cindy LEUNG: I'll buy one of those
26/09/2016, 18:03 - Mom: actually the vonhaus and duronic look pretty much the same
26/09/2016, 18:03 - Mom: but for vonhaus they charge a high delivery charge that i think is not quite reasonable
26/09/2016, 18:04 - Mom: *higher
26/09/2016, 18:05 - Cindy LEUNG: I thought it's free delivery
26/09/2016, 18:06 - Cindy LEUNG: What abt the Russell Hobbs one
26/09/2016, 18:08 - Cindy LEUNG: I bet u were like ¬£40 for an upright one, might as well buy a cylinder vacuum
26/09/2016, 18:22 - Mom: no
26/09/2016, 18:22 - Mom: i see the spec
26/09/2016, 18:22 - Mom: *compare
26/09/2016, 18:23 - Cindy LEUNG: OK I saw it was very low wattage so nvm
26/09/2016, 18:23 - Mom: 450w
26/09/2016, 18:23 - Cindy LEUNG: I'm now deciding which stick vacuum to buy
26/09/2016, 18:23 - Mom: i like the russell hobbs as well, but too low power

26/09/2016, 19:29 - Mom: Good night
26/09/2016, 20:38 - Cindy LEUNG: So I just had a rapid hr episode
26/09/2016, 20:38 - Cindy LEUNG: My hr suddenly increased a lot
26/09/2016, 20:39 - Cindy LEUNG: I was sitting at my desk looking at amazon
26/09/2016, 20:39 - Cindy LEUNG: This happened around 20:20
26/09/2016, 20:40 - Cindy LEUNG: And then I tried to measure my hr on my phone
26/09/2016, 20:40 - Cindy LEUNG: But I could cuz my hand kept shaking
26/09/2016, 20:40 - Cindy LEUNG: Couldn't
26/09/2016, 20:40 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea tried a few times
26/09/2016, 20:41 - Cindy LEUNG: And then I remembered that I recovered really fast last time I played some music
26/09/2016, 20:41 - Cindy LEUNG: So quickly turned on Spotify and played something
26/09/2016, 20:43 - Cindy LEUNG: And the shaking really stopped almost immediately
26/09/2016, 20:44 - Cindy LEUNG: And then hr dropped back to normal as well within the same song (abt 2-3 mins)
26/09/2016, 20:45 - Cindy LEUNG: There was a point where I decided to put on headphones after the shaking stopped
26/09/2016, 20:48 - Cindy LEUNG: my hr was still really high, I closed my eyes and could like see these curves which pulsed to the music and I thought bloody hell I can see music now
26/09/2016, 20:49 - Cindy LEUNG: And then I went back to normal and couldn't see them anymore
26/09/2016, 23:21 - Cindy LEUNG: Ugh
26/09/2016, 23:21 - Cindy LEUNG: Just had a series of really bad nightmare
26/09/2016, 23:21 - Cindy LEUNG: I sleep around 2130
26/09/2016, 23:21 - Cindy LEUNG: I think I have jet lag
26/09/2016, 23:22 - Cindy LEUNG: Anyways I fell asleep with the lights on
26/09/2016, 23:23 - Cindy LEUNG: First ending there was a fire
26/09/2016, 23:23 - Cindy LEUNG: And then people got burnt and died in that
26/09/2016, 23:24 - Cindy LEUNG: I woke up and rolled around to sleep on my other side
26/09/2016, 23:24 - Cindy LEUNG: And then second ending
26/09/2016, 23:26 - Cindy LEUNG: Some crazy person starts to threaten me and then tells me that bad shit will start happening to me after 5.50
26/09/2016, 23:27 - Cindy LEUNG: I wake up, sort of see smoke at the end of the bed and hear soft crackling sounds
26/09/2016, 23:27 - Cindy LEUNG: I actually see the smoke
26/09/2016, 23:28 - Cindy LEUNG: And then I try to get up but off I hv sleep para so I can't move
26/09/2016, 23:29 - Cindy LEUNG: Sorry I forget to mention that I thought there was an actual fire in my room
26/09/2016, 23:31 - Cindy LEUNG: So I manage to get up
26/09/2016, 23:31 - Cindy LEUNG: And then I discover there is no fire
26/09/2016, 23:32 - Cindy LEUNG: Already feeling scared
26/09/2016, 23:32 - Cindy LEUNG: All this happened with lights on btw
26/09/2016, 23:33 - Cindy LEUNG: I started to think abt 5.50
26/09/2016, 23:35 - Cindy LEUNG: The time u see in dreams are often flipped, so if u think abt an analog clock, then they were referring to 7.40
26/09/2016, 23:39 - Cindy LEUNG: That's abt 0240 HK time
26/09/2016, 23:40 - Cindy LEUNG: Hmmm
26/09/2016, 23:40 - Cindy LEUNG: Back to the jet lag issue
26/09/2016, 23:41 - Cindy LEUNG: I realise I'm sleeping really early here
26/09/2016, 23:41 - Cindy LEUNG: Like around 2130
26/09/2016, 23:42 - Cindy LEUNG: I assume this is jet lag, or adjustment cuz I have wacky sleep schedules
26/09/2016, 23:42 - Cindy LEUNG: Anyways
26/09/2016, 23:42 - Cindy LEUNG: And while I was thinking abt this stuff, I fell asleep again
26/09/2016, 23:43 - Cindy LEUNG: And then the nightmare continues (this is weird already)
26/09/2016, 23:44 - Cindy LEUNG: So I end up in the same place with the same crazy guy
26/09/2016, 23:44 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea he turns into a nonhuman looking monster
26/09/2016, 23:45 - Cindy LEUNG: Basically I just get attacked in this ending
26/09/2016, 23:46 - Cindy LEUNG: The monster grabs me and flings me round so that my body hits the wall hard
26/09/2016, 23:47 - Cindy LEUNG: That happens like twice
26/09/2016, 23:47 - Cindy LEUNG: And then it does some mental thing
26/09/2016, 23:48 - Cindy LEUNG: So it's hard to describe but I sort of know it's not real at this point
26/09/2016, 23:48 - Cindy LEUNG: But even then I still feel terrible
26/09/2016, 23:50 - Cindy LEUNG: Its like it puts u under its spell and makes u feel really scared and confused
26/09/2016, 23:50 - Cindy LEUNG: Ugh
26/09/2016, 23:51 - Cindy LEUNG: If u ask me what the monster looked like
26/09/2016, 23:52 - Cindy LEUNG: Hard to say, cuz Everytime I looked at it, it kind of looked like a bunch of mosaic tiles
26/09/2016, 23:52 - Cindy LEUNG: Like as if my brain already censored it lol
26/09/2016, 23:52 - Cindy LEUNG: But it's some scary shit
26/09/2016, 23:53 - Cindy LEUNG: So scary u can't see it properly
26/09/2016, 23:54 - Cindy LEUNG: So shit
26/09/2016, 23:54 - Cindy LEUNG: What do I do
26/09/2016, 23:55 - Cindy LEUNG: I hope it doesn't continue
26/09/2016, 23:56 - Cindy LEUNG: Sometimes I really feel there's something instead my head which seeks to destroy me
27/09/2016, 00:00 - Cindy LEUNG: And that thing is not me, its like there's someone which is not supposed to be in there
27/09/2016, 00:02 - Cindy LEUNG: Audio hallucinations are definite now
27/09/2016, 00:04 - Mom: Hi
27/09/2016, 00:04 - Cindy LEUNG: I forgot to mention when I had the seizure? At 2030 I heard two Indian girls chatting outside and other stuff before I started shaking
27/09/2016, 00:05 - Mom: They spoke english or indian
27/09/2016, 00:06 - Cindy LEUNG: Dunno, just heard 'chatter'
27/09/2016, 00:06 - Cindy LEUNG: But somehow I knew they were indian
27/09/2016, 00:06 - Cindy LEUNG: There are no Indians on this floor btw

27/09/2016, 00:08 - Cindy LEUNG: All of above happened between those times
27/09/2016, 00:09 - Cindy LEUNG: I would like to go back to sleep but I don't want to be burnt alive or skinned etc
27/09/2016, 00:10 - Cindy LEUNG: The monster is specifically out for me
27/09/2016, 00:10 - Cindy LEUNG: It thinks I'm responsible for something
27/09/2016, 00:11 - Mom: is this the first time u had this kind of bad dream?
27/09/2016, 00:11 - Cindy LEUNG: Like one this long and continuous? Yah

27/09/2016, 00:40 - Cindy LEUNG: not right now, i don't think so
27/09/2016, 00:40 - Cindy LEUNG: i think it was being inside the monastery as well
27/09/2016, 00:41 - Mom: no, that buddha sound has the same effect even outside monastery
27/09/2016, 00:42 - Cindy LEUNG: no i mean i felt safe cuz i was inside the monastery
27/09/2016, 00:42 - Cindy LEUNG: not just cuz of the sound
27/09/2016, 00:42 - Cindy LEUNG: and anyways

27/09/2016, 00:48 - Mom: so that u can sleep well

27/09/2016, 00:56 - Mom: falling out a lot?
27/09/2016, 00:56 - Mom: that can be a result of anxiety or thyroid

30/09/2016, 13:42 - Mom: unreasonable
30/09/2016, 13:42 - Cindy LEUNG: Like the course page wasn't even ready
30/09/2016, 13:42 - Mom: cuz econ ppl need to handle lots of data
30/09/2016, 13:42 - Mom: i think this relates that person only
30/09/2016, 13:42 - Cindy LEUNG: And then the macro guy basically drones for an hr
30/09/2016, 13:42 - Mom: not the whole dept
30/09/2016, 13:43 - Cindy LEUNG: ....
30/09/2016, 13:43 - Cindy LEUNG: So rare to get good econ lecturer
30/09/2016, 13:43 - Mom: chi seen

30/09/2016, 13:44 - Mom: go to states la
30/09/2016, 13:44 - Cindy LEUNG: The upenn lady and the guy from Columbia r the only good macro lecturers
30/09/2016, 13:45 - Cindy LEUNG: And then micro, I don't even know why the explanation was so confusing
30/09/2016, 13:45 - Mom: so lse is backed up by upenn and columbia
30/09/2016, 13:45 - Cindy LEUNG: I watched the same thing from MIT this morning and I could understand pretty well
30/09/2016, 13:46 - Mom: and then micro is backed up by ppl from mit/ uchicage/ nu
30/09/2016, 13:46 - Cindy LEUNG: üôàüôàüôà econ
30/09/2016, 13:46 - Cindy LEUNG: The gov Dept is quite good though
30/09/2016, 13:46 - Mom: don't understand why lse econ is the best in the world
30/09/2016, 13:46 - Cindy LEUNG: Their lecturers actually teach
30/09/2016, 13:46 - Cindy LEUNG: Yaaaah
30/09/2016, 13:47 - Mom: now u hv a grasp of the teaching qualities of different unis
30/09/2016, 13:47 - Cindy LEUNG: Well yaah
30/09/2016, 13:47 - Mom: so u know how to choose for the second deg
30/09/2016, 13:48 - Cindy LEUNG: No this mean need to choose third year courses carefully
30/09/2016, 13:48 - Mom: u still hv to choose one econ course
30/09/2016, 13:49 - Cindy LEUNG: Yes
30/09/2016, 13:49 - Cindy LEUNG: I need to pick one with good lecturer
30/09/2016, 13:49 - Mom: will the third yr econ course be taught by professors or RA??
30/09/2016, 13:49 - Cindy LEUNG: Professor? I dunno
30/09/2016, 13:50 - Mom: lse may change course lecturer every year
30/09/2016, 13:50 - Cindy LEUNG: Not that much people per course in third year
30/09/2016, 13:50 - Mom: it'd difficult to predict
30/09/2016, 13:50 - Cindy LEUNG: So they teach it themselves I think
30/09/2016, 13:51 - Cindy LEUNG: Though this year my econ courses r massive
30/09/2016, 13:51 - Cindy LEUNG: And for finance, the lecture hall is full
30/09/2016, 13:51 - Mom: ...
30/09/2016, 13:51 - Cindy LEUNG: To the brim
30/09/2016, 13:51 - Cindy LEUNG: I had to sit in first row
30/09/2016, 13:52 - Cindy LEUNG: Meanwhile, I think gov got better
30/09/2016, 13:52 - Mom: for a student who's late for the whole lecture except last 10 mins to sit in the front roll
30/09/2016, 13:52 - Mom: rlly funny
30/09/2016, 14:04 - Cindy LEUNG: Lol
30/09/2016, 14:05 - Cindy LEUNG: I wouldn't have to do that for econ
01/10/2016, 08:52 - Cindy LEUNG: Hi

01/10/2016, 09:39 - Cindy LEUNG: Like last night
01/10/2016, 09:42 - Cindy LEUNG: I was running from this pervert who likes to tie girls up and hang them upside down so that their T-shirt would roll down their chest, but stop just before the nipples so you get a peek of them
01/10/2016, 09:43 - Cindy LEUNG: Oh he also films them, so thats how I know
01/10/2016, 09:44 - Cindy LEUNG: And then there was also this camera monitoring app I downloaded on my phone and I couldn't erase
01/10/2016, 09:46 - Cindy LEUNG: And then there were also giant giraffes? Which exploded whenever one climbed on top of another one
01/10/2016, 09:47 - Mom: looks like a movie

01/10/2016, 09:49 - Cindy LEUNG: I just run off in the end
01/10/2016, 09:50 - Cindy LEUNG: I don't think I'll ever get weapons
01/10/2016, 09:50 - Cindy LEUNG: Only very bad people have weapons in my dreams

01/10/2016, 10:02 - Mom: do u feel the pain if ur shot?
01/10/2016, 10:02 - Cindy LEUNG: But not very often
01/10/2016, 10:02 - Cindy LEUNG: No pain
01/10/2016, 10:02 - Cindy LEUNG: Pain requires external stimulation I think
01/10/2016, 10:03 - Mom: no, i was thinking if u felt pain then physically ur sick at that part of ur body
01/10/2016, 10:04 - Cindy LEUNG: Oh
01/10/2016, 10:04 - Cindy LEUNG: No then
01/10/2016, 10:04 - Cindy LEUNG: No pain
01/10/2016, 10:07 - Mom: any emotional disturbances after these dreams?
01/10/2016, 10:07 - Cindy LEUNG: Erm yea
01/10/2016, 10:07 - Cindy LEUNG: I tend to wake up quickly from them
01/10/2016, 10:08 - Cindy LEUNG: So when I wake up, I get very confused and still think it's dream
01/10/2016, 10:09 - Mom: why confused??
01/10/2016, 10:09 - Mom: u know they're dreams only
01/10/2016, 10:09 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz u r still thinking with emotional part of brain
01/10/2016, 10:10 - Cindy LEUNG: Lately I've been able to recognize this situation more quickly
01/10/2016, 10:10 - Cindy LEUNG: So I don't get that scared
01/10/2016, 10:11 - Mom: before, ur scared becuz u can't differentiate those dreams with the reality??
01/10/2016, 10:15 - Cindy LEUNG: no before i get really scared because the emotional memory of them are very strong, and i'm not exactly conscious when i am 'awake'
01/10/2016, 10:15 - Cindy LEUNG: now i recognize the situation, and i kind of tell my brain to wake the fuck up or turn on the lights
01/10/2016, 10:17 - Mom: very good analogy
01/10/2016, 10:17 - Cindy LEUNG: hahaha
01/10/2016, 10:17 - Mom: still have sleep paralysis?

01/10/2016, 10:21 - Mom: this morning, i watched a tv show saying that eating veggie at ur breakfast time everyday helps u lower ur overall BG level
01/10/2016, 10:22 - Cindy LEUNG: i eat two bananas every morning
01/10/2016, 10:23 - Mom: the main point is eating fislbres in the morning helps ur small intestine absorbing glucose more slowly
01/10/2016, 10:23 - Mom: so that ur BG level won't surge very much when u eat
01/10/2016, 10:24 - Cindy LEUNG: oh well, yea i've only been eating bananas

01/10/2016, 14:15 - Cindy LEUNG: TO ADD MONEY INTO MY BLOODY LAUNDRY CARD
01/10/2016, 14:16 - Mom: ....

01/10/2016, 14:16 - Mom: i mean how did u pay for ur laundry last yr
01/10/2016, 14:17 - Cindy LEUNG: i added in 20pp like a month ago
01/10/2016, 14:17 - Cindy LEUNG: before i needed to use the moeny
01/10/2016, 14:17 - Cindy LEUNG: because it takes a money for bank to transfer
01/10/2016, 14:17 - Cindy LEUNG: a month
01/10/2016, 14:17 - Cindy LEUNG: in the beginning i was on paypal hk
01/10/2016, 14:17 - Cindy LEUNG: so i used my credit card
01/10/2016, 14:18 - Cindy LEUNG: and then i realised they carded like 3% service charge everytime i use my card
01/10/2016, 14:18 - Mom: no ah
01/10/2016, 14:18 - Mom: it's 1.95%
01/10/2016, 14:19 - Cindy LEUNG: oh
01/10/2016, 14:19 - Cindy LEUNG: well whatever
01/10/2016, 14:19 - Cindy LEUNG: they charged me service basically
01/10/2016, 14:20 - Cindy LEUNG: so i opened up a uk paypal
01/10/2016, 14:20 - Cindy LEUNG: and then i released that paypal is seriously the spawn of satan
01/10/2016, 14:20 - Cindy LEUNG: and that elon musk is not that great of a guy after all
01/10/2016, 14:21 - Cindy LEUNG: why would anyone in their right mind, create an online paying service which doesn't let you enter an international address?
01/10/2016, 14:22 - Mom: this is a very interesting question
01/10/2016, 14:22 - Cindy LEUNG: oh right
01/10/2016, 14:22 - Mom: btw, what service charge paypal charges u?
01/10/2016, 14:22 - Cindy LEUNG: if i use an hk paypal account
01/10/2016, 14:22 - Cindy LEUNG: and pay for pounds
01/10/2016, 14:23 - Cindy LEUNG: they charge me for conversion
01/10/2016, 14:23 - Mom: what?
01/10/2016, 14:23 - Mom: how?
01/10/2016, 14:23 - Mom: u mean conversion rate
01/10/2016, 14:23 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz to them i'm transferring money overseas
01/10/2016, 14:23 - Mom: u can choose to be charged on original currency
01/10/2016, 14:24 - Mom: like if u need to pay pound, u shud select to pay pound or hk$
01/10/2016, 14:24 - Mom: i mean in hk
01/10/2016, 14:24 - Cindy LEUNG: yea but u see
01/10/2016, 14:24 - Mom: if u use the paypal hk
01/10/2016, 14:24 - Cindy LEUNG: i want to enter my intl credit card
01/10/2016, 14:24 - Cindy LEUNG: and so because it is registered to a hk address
01/10/2016, 14:25 - Cindy LEUNG: i need to use hk paypal
01/10/2016, 14:25 - Mom: and then visa charges 1% and the bank charges 0.95% on forex
01/10/2016, 14:25 - Mom: u can use my paypal ac
01/10/2016, 14:25 - Cindy LEUNG: ok
01/10/2016, 14:25 - Mom: so no need to open another one
01/10/2016, 14:25 - Cindy LEUNG: i might as well close my uk one
01/10/2016, 14:25 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz it's useless
01/10/2016, 14:26 - Mom: nvm
01/10/2016, 14:26 - Cindy LEUNG: plus they blocked my uk card
01/10/2016, 14:26 - Cindy LEUNG: so hence paypal is a dumb fuck
01/10/2016, 14:26 - Mom: cuz that's a debit card not a credit card
01/10/2016, 14:26 - Cindy LEUNG: no u can enter in debit cards
01/10/2016, 14:26 - Cindy LEUNG: but u can't enter an hk address
01/10/2016, 14:27 - Mom: that's why i ask if u better apply for a uk credit card last week
01/10/2016, 14:27 - Cindy LEUNG: sigh
01/10/2016, 14:27 - Mom: then ask bea to change address la
01/10/2016, 14:27 - Cindy LEUNG: then i'll have to change it every year
01/10/2016, 14:27 - Cindy LEUNG: =.=
01/10/2016, 14:27 - Mom: errrr

03/10/2016, 10:50 - Mom: it's only habit
03/10/2016, 10:50 - Cindy LEUNG: This lateness thing is obviously a structural problem
03/10/2016, 10:51 - Cindy LEUNG: Target a certain group of individuals
03/10/2016, 10:51 - Cindy LEUNG: Hence school should review late policy

03/10/2016, 10:53 - Cindy LEUNG: Lulz

05/10/2016, 23:17 - Cindy LEUNG: And then they screened out 88
05/10/2016, 23:17 - Cindy LEUNG: Of us
05/10/2016, 23:18 - Mom: Wow
05/10/2016, 23:18 - Mom: That's a lot of chance
05/10/2016, 23:20 - Mom: 88/300 ~ 30% acceptance rate
05/10/2016, 23:20 - Mom: Which is greater than that for applying to lse
05/10/2016, 23:21 - Cindy LEUNG: No it's a lse only event
05/10/2016, 23:21 - Cindy LEUNG: So u gotta be from lse first

05/10/2016, 23:25 - Cindy LEUNG: And then u go out and talk to a trader
05/10/2016, 23:25 - Cindy LEUNG: They're like dude Ur competition is like a guy with PhD in physics or maths
05/10/2016, 23:26 - Cindy LEUNG: Ofc u need econ base
05/10/2016, 23:26 - Cindy LEUNG: Or math
05/10/2016, 23:26 - Mom: Yea
05/10/2016, 23:27 - Mom: They pick all kinds of candidates
05/10/2016, 23:27 - Mom: Priority goes to someone from famous uni
05/10/2016, 23:28 - Cindy LEUNG: No everyone is from lse there
05/10/2016, 23:28 - Cindy LEUNG: The point is
05/10/2016, 23:29 - Cindy LEUNG: If u want to do Quanto, u need high level of math and computing knowledge
05/10/2016, 23:31 - Mom: Ur just doing intern as a second yr student
05/10/2016, 23:32 - Mom: Everyone there is abt the same level
05/10/2016, 23:33 - Mom: How can someone got so high level quanto & computer skills?
05/10/2016, 23:35 - Mom: besides, ppl there r from lse, they won't be taught with maths and physics skills like imperial or mit??
05/10/2016, 23:36 - Cindy LEUNG: ok u misunderstood me
05/10/2016, 23:36 - Cindy LEUNG: so i asked about fintech
05/10/2016, 23:36 - Cindy LEUNG: and then the guy was like everybody trading with algorithms nowadays
05/10/2016, 23:37 - Cindy LEUNG: so he was like tbh u need at least msc econ to be on par with those phd maths guys
05/10/2016, 23:39 - Cindy LEUNG: so he says, ofc u need econ or finance background
05/10/2016, 23:39 - Mom: so, r they saying they're not going to take in a second yr student for internship??
05/10/2016, 23:39 - Cindy LEUNG: no
05/10/2016, 23:39 - Cindy LEUNG: lol
05/10/2016, 23:39 - Cindy LEUNG: this is like post internship world i think
05/10/2016, 23:39 - Mom: ur worrying abt the actual job market?

05/10/2016, 23:41 - Cindy LEUNG: plus im glad i took finance
05/10/2016, 23:41 - Cindy LEUNG: i have no idea what they are talking about
05/10/2016, 23:41 - Mom: what?? no idea?
05/10/2016, 23:42 - Mom: well
05/10/2016, 23:43 - Mom: ur understanding abt the qualitative and quanto reminds me that a-level education system is correct
05/10/2016, 23:44 - Cindy LEUNG: yah
05/10/2016, 23:44 - Cindy LEUNG: well just in general i'm really confused about how the industry works
05/10/2016, 23:44 - Mom: cuz it clearly distinguish ppl's interest and abilities on quanto and qualitative jobs
05/10/2016, 23:45 - Cindy LEUNG: it's like applying to university situation all over again
05/10/2016, 23:45 - Mom: i don't get ur prob?
05/10/2016, 23:45 - Mom: why?
05/10/2016, 23:46 - Mom: ppl can always switch between trading and sales positions during their lives
05/10/2016, 23:47 - Mom: in fact ppl always need to do both at the same
05/10/2016, 23:47 - Cindy LEUNG: yeah too bad
05/10/2016, 23:47 - Cindy LEUNG: people can't switch between econ and engineering
05/10/2016, 23:48 - Mom: no
05/10/2016, 23:48 - Mom: ppl from engrg can do a master in econ
05/10/2016, 23:48 - Cindy LEUNG: not the other way round
05/10/2016, 23:49 - Cindy LEUNG: unless u go to boston u
05/10/2016, 23:49 - Mom: only that ppl from econ has to start engrg from the start
05/10/2016, 23:49 - Mom: sigh...
05/10/2016, 23:49 - Cindy LEUNG: at this point, i think i understand why there is an industrial engineering
05/10/2016, 23:50 - Cindy LEUNG: they do more structural side of things
05/10/2016, 23:50 - Mom: i think u rlly missed ur NU vacancy
05/10/2016, 23:51 - Cindy LEUNG: nah i dont think so
05/10/2016, 23:51 - Mom: what's the structural side of things?
05/10/2016, 23:52 - Cindy LEUNG: like people who work on teh microstructures of markets
05/10/2016, 23:52 - Cindy LEUNG: essentially the quanto guys
05/10/2016, 23:52 - Mom: ai ya
05/10/2016, 23:53 - Cindy LEUNG: meanwhile i have to deal with an angry tibetian
05/10/2016, 23:53 - Mom: sci deg does quanto thingy, and ba deg does bullshit thingy

06/10/2016, 00:08 - Mom: they ruin ppl's properties there
06/10/2016, 00:08 - Cindy LEUNG: so japanese are protective of their stuff
06/10/2016, 00:12 - Mom: sigh
06/10/2016, 00:14 - Mom: the world is somewhat having a "locust disaster"
06/10/2016, 00:16 - Cindy LEUNG: seems like continuing study is a good idea
06/10/2016, 00:17 - Cindy LEUNG: did u know most americans have very little savings?
06/10/2016, 00:20 - Mom: i thought the americans used to have debts
06/10/2016, 00:21 - Cindy LEUNG: they come out of college with huge debt
06/10/2016, 00:21 - Mom: sigh
06/10/2016, 00:21 - Mom: so hugh college costs
06/10/2016, 00:22 - Cindy LEUNG: but just in general americans have little savings
06/10/2016, 00:22 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz their tax is like 40%
06/10/2016, 00:22 - Mom: did u read the link which i sent to u yesterday abt the costs of living in us
06/10/2016, 00:22 - Cindy LEUNG: but they have to pay extra for a lot of basic services which should be provided by gov but aren't
06/10/2016, 00:23 - Mom: that's why i don't even understand where the taxes go to in america
06/10/2016, 00:23 - Mom: americans pay rlly high tax
06/10/2016, 00:24 - Cindy LEUNG: yea
06/10/2016, 00:24 - Cindy LEUNG: national defense
06/10/2016, 00:24 - Cindy LEUNG: is  huge part of the budget
06/10/2016, 00:24 - Mom: in uk, at least u get free nhs
06/10/2016, 00:24 - Mom: low cost college
06/10/2016, 00:24 - Cindy LEUNG: yea
06/10/2016, 00:25 - Cindy LEUNG: did u know hk has the most efficient health system in the world
06/10/2016, 00:25 - Mom: ofc la
06/10/2016, 00:25 - Cindy LEUNG: according to bloomberg or BI
06/10/2016, 00:25 - Cindy LEUNG: wow
06/10/2016, 00:25 - Mom: that's what uk creates for hk
06/10/2016, 00:26 - Mom: i always wonder why british so smat but can't even fix probs in uk??
06/10/2016, 00:27 - Cindy LEUNG: because look at the tube
06/10/2016, 00:27 - Cindy LEUNG: i feel like the mtr is a better version of the tube
06/10/2016, 00:27 - Cindy LEUNG: pretty sure the guys who designed the mtr probably built the tube as well
06/10/2016, 00:28 - Mom: what's ur theory?
06/10/2016, 00:29 - Mom: tube in uk is good ah
06/10/2016, 00:30 - Cindy LEUNG: dude the mtr is hands down a better designed and built system
06/10/2016, 00:34 - Mom: u think so? how?
06/10/2016, 00:37 - Cindy LEUNG: Think abt it
06/10/2016, 00:37 - Mom: ok
06/10/2016, 00:37 - Cindy LEUNG: When u change lines all u hv to do is walk to opposite side
06/10/2016, 00:37 - Mom: i think u shud sleep la
06/10/2016, 00:38 - Mom: oooh
06/10/2016, 00:38 - Mom: space in london is limited ma
06/10/2016, 00:39 - Mom: so brits need to dig deep into the ground for more space
06/10/2016, 00:39 - Mom: ur rite, platforms in uk tube r so narrrow
06/10/2016, 00:40 - Mom: i wonder if ppl be pushed into the track when there're lots of ppl waiting for the train
06/10/2016, 00:42 - Cindy LEUNG: the most annoying thing is u always gotta walk like a mile to switch trains
06/10/2016, 00:43 - Cindy LEUNG: no people don't push on the tube
06/10/2016, 00:44 - Mom: i hate it too
06/10/2016, 00:44 - Mom: but the tube has been design and built for long long time ago
06/10/2016, 00:45 - Mom: u see those new stations like st pancreas, they have big station platform and much more convenient
06/10/2016, 00:45 - Mom: bare in mind that there're lots of lines in uk tube
06/10/2016, 00:46 - Mom: whereas in hk, there're only two in the beginning
06/10/2016, 00:48 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea that's why I say the MTR is probably a refined version of the tube
06/10/2016, 00:49 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz Brits built both of them rite
06/10/2016, 00:49 - Cindy LEUNG: Its so windy these couple of days

08/10/2016, 03:43 - Cindy LEUNG: Wow
08/10/2016, 03:44 - Cindy LEUNG: But I'm guessing he probably does something ir or econ related
08/10/2016, 03:44 - Mom: i swear that he must be loving nu soooo much
08/10/2016, 03:44 - Cindy LEUNG: Or else u wouldn't come

08/10/2016, 03:46 - Cindy LEUNG: No like gv100
08/10/2016, 03:46 - Cindy LEUNG: Intro to ir
08/10/2016, 03:47 - Mom: what?

08/10/2016, 03:50 - Cindy LEUNG: And less contact time
08/10/2016, 03:50 - Cindy LEUNG: So Hl econ is a piece of cake imo
08/10/2016, 03:50 - Mom: i think lse courses r rlly value for money if u can follow through the courses
08/10/2016, 03:51 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea but then there's so much to read if u want to do the qualitative courses properly
08/10/2016, 03:51 - Cindy LEUNG: IMO the Quanto courses are more manageable
08/10/2016, 03:51 - Mom: u guys have plenty of time to do those reading ma
08/10/2016, 03:52 - Cindy LEUNG: Reading for one course takes six hrs üòíüòíüòíüòí

08/10/2016, 15:13 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea I think so
08/10/2016, 15:13 - Cindy LEUNG: Or else it would take a day to charge
08/10/2016, 15:14 - Mom: fast charging makes ur battery turns rlly hot

08/10/2016, 15:14 - Mom: is it ur plastic cover looks burnt or the phone itself?
08/10/2016, 15:16 - Cindy LEUNG: Just The cover
08/10/2016, 15:17 - Mom: use more time to do charging la
08/10/2016, 15:17 - Mom: or just use fast charging for short time
08/10/2016, 15:17 - Mom: not until 100% full

10/10/2016, 12:00 - Cindy LEUNG: I don't have that many paper or books...
10/10/2016, 12:00 - Cindy LEUNG: I thought maybe the cardboard
10/10/2016, 12:01 - Cindy LEUNG: Or the wood? But it looks well treated
10/10/2016, 12:01 - Mom: having some incense burning in ur room
10/10/2016, 12:01 - Mom: the smell helps get rid of those tiny paper dust bugs
10/10/2016, 12:01 - Cindy LEUNG: No lah
10/10/2016, 12:01 - Cindy LEUNG: That would set off the fire a
10/10/2016, 12:01 - Cindy LEUNG: Alarm
10/10/2016, 12:02 - Mom: perhaps the wood isn't dry enough??
10/10/2016, 12:02 - Mom: u never know
10/10/2016, 12:02 - Mom: that building is one yr old, the wood might be still wet inside
10/10/2016, 12:02 - Cindy LEUNG: But that was definitely a paper bug
10/10/2016, 12:03 - Mom: lots of cardboard??
10/10/2016, 12:03 - Cindy LEUNG: No I put them away...
10/10/2016, 12:03 - Mom: wud it be from the partition between the rooms?

10/10/2016, 12:04 - Mom: they might use cardboard for partition
10/10/2016, 12:04 - Cindy LEUNG: God knows it might hv come from next door
10/10/2016, 12:04 - Mom: sigh
10/10/2016, 12:04 - Cindy LEUNG: The girl is disgusting
10/10/2016, 12:04 - Mom: BJ girl?

10/10/2016, 12:08 - Cindy LEUNG: Not sure who allocates rooms
10/10/2016, 12:08 - Mom: urbanest i think

10/10/2016, 12:10 - Mom: ok
10/10/2016, 12:10 - Cindy LEUNG: Plus I haven't paid second installment
10/10/2016, 12:10 - Mom: if u keep living with those flatmates, no good ah
10/10/2016, 12:10 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea I hear people who live in Carr saunders
10/10/2016, 12:11 - Cindy LEUNG: They seem to hv better community there
10/10/2016, 12:11 - Cindy LEUNG: I.e. the group is more diverse
10/10/2016, 12:11 - Cindy LEUNG: Here is like
10/10/2016, 12:12 - Cindy LEUNG: It can't be coincidence that all the Chinese ppl ended up together and all the white ppl ended up together
10/10/2016, 12:12 - Mom: find some reasons and ask for a change la
10/10/2016, 12:12 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz I've seen that there r actually a lot of white people on my floor
10/10/2016, 12:12 - Cindy LEUNG: I swear the room next door is all white
10/10/2016, 12:13 - Mom: sigh
10/10/2016, 12:13 - Cindy LEUNG: So what r the chances of three chinese ppl in one room if it's random
10/10/2016, 12:13 - Cindy LEUNG: They don't just sort by color
10/10/2016, 12:13 - Cindy LEUNG: I think they seriously just allocated by ethnicity
10/10/2016, 12:14 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz I see all the Koreans ended up together
10/10/2016, 12:14 - Cindy LEUNG: And all the Indians are together
10/10/2016, 12:14 - Mom: still race prob
10/10/2016, 12:14 - Cindy LEUNG: Like theres an Indian flat opposite me
10/10/2016, 12:14 - Cindy LEUNG: .....
10/10/2016, 12:14 - Mom: what happen on their brain
10/10/2016, 12:14 - Mom: they eat shit
10/10/2016, 12:14 - Cindy LEUNG: I can't believe lse ppl would allocate like that
10/10/2016, 12:15 - Mom: so, i think it's the urbanest prob not lse
10/10/2016, 12:15 - Cindy LEUNG: I hope it's urbanest
10/10/2016, 12:15 - Cindy LEUNG: Or else I'm having serious doubts abt lsr
10/10/2016, 12:15 - Cindy LEUNG: Lse
10/10/2016, 12:15 - Mom: why r they doing this, create so much race prob
10/10/2016, 12:15 - Cindy LEUNG: Yah exactly
10/10/2016, 12:16 - Cindy LEUNG: This is deliberately creating racial tension
10/10/2016, 12:16 - Mom: ok, just ask if u can change ur room mixed with other race and see how they respond
10/10/2016, 12:17 - Cindy LEUNG: I'll see what I can do
10/10/2016, 12:18 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz I've come to the conclusion that there aren't actually that many mandonese ppl here
10/10/2016, 12:18 - Mom: they thought ur from china as well
10/10/2016, 12:19 - Cindy LEUNG: Its just they somehow find each other really quickly and then they go in big groups
10/10/2016, 12:19 - Mom: so give u a room with those mando
10/10/2016, 12:19 - Cindy LEUNG: Well they r white
10/10/2016, 12:19 - Cindy LEUNG: They can't even tell the difference between Japanese and Chinese
10/10/2016, 12:20 - Mom: they have ur personal info from lse
10/10/2016, 12:20 - Cindy LEUNG: Well yeaa
10/10/2016, 12:20 - Mom: before they allocate a room to u, lse give them ur personal info
10/10/2016, 12:20 - Cindy LEUNG: There r so actually very little Korean here as well
10/10/2016, 12:21 - Cindy LEUNG: So I just find it weird that everybody seems to find their race group so quickly?
10/10/2016, 12:21 - Cindy LEUNG: Not convincing
10/10/2016, 12:21 - Mom: so i think it's urbanest which allocate u into a group of chinese
10/10/2016, 12:21 - Mom: they don't even know the difference between hong kong and mainland china
10/10/2016, 12:21 - Cindy LEUNG: I've heard one or two hker
10/10/2016, 12:22 - Cindy LEUNG: But I don't think there r many here
10/10/2016, 12:22 - Mom: even better to live with hongkie then mando la
10/10/2016, 12:22 - Cindy LEUNG: Well yah
10/10/2016, 12:22 - Mom: sigh...
10/10/2016, 12:23 - Cindy LEUNG: The other guy is okay
10/10/2016, 12:23 - Cindy LEUNG: He keeps clean
10/10/2016, 12:23 - Mom: but what's the point of go study abroad
10/10/2016, 12:23 - Cindy LEUNG: He said he was from somewhere close to shanghai
10/10/2016, 12:23 - Mom: if i wanna see my ppl often, i prefer to stay in my home land
10/10/2016, 12:24 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea what's the point of study abroad
10/10/2016, 12:24 - Cindy LEUNG: üòûüòû
10/10/2016, 12:24 - Mom: those brits r somewhat stupid
10/10/2016, 12:24 - Cindy LEUNG: U know I only know londoners cuz I do society work with them
10/10/2016, 12:25 - Mom: üòûüòû
10/10/2016, 12:25 - Cindy LEUNG: Even my Kings friend said he had a study buddy yesterday
10/10/2016, 12:25 - Cindy LEUNG: I've never seen a study group in lse I swear
10/10/2016, 12:26 - Mom: sigh
10/10/2016, 12:26 - Cindy LEUNG: Though I do suspect some racial sorting is happening
10/10/2016, 12:26 - Cindy LEUNG: I just went to my gv class
10/10/2016, 12:27 - Cindy LEUNG: Its pretty mixed
10/10/2016, 12:27 - Mom: i wonder if all the students at lse behave like that
10/10/2016, 12:27 - Cindy LEUNG: Mostly Brits and a few french
10/10/2016, 12:27 - Cindy LEUNG: And then there are two HK ppl.
10/10/2016, 12:27 - Cindy LEUNG: I feel that that was deliberate
10/10/2016, 12:28 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz I know that there r only two HK ppl in the gov and econ course
10/10/2016, 12:28 - Cindy LEUNG: And what are the chances that we both end up in the same seminar group
10/10/2016, 12:28 - Cindy LEUNG: There are like 4+ groups in total
10/10/2016, 12:28 - Mom: u mean lse intentionally makes this allocation?
10/10/2016, 12:28 - Cindy LEUNG: I suspect that
10/10/2016, 12:29 - Cindy LEUNG: Though to be fair I think she probably took finance as outside option too
10/10/2016, 12:29 - Cindy LEUNG: So we probably have similar timetable
10/10/2016, 12:30 - Mom: but lse can
10/10/2016, 12:30 - Mom: lse can't control ppl's option choice
10/10/2016, 12:30 - Cindy LEUNG: But still, I don't need them to give me someone of my own race to talk to
10/10/2016, 12:30 - Cindy LEUNG: That really insulting.
10/10/2016, 12:30 - Cindy LEUNG: Thats
10/10/2016, 12:31 - Mom: üòûüòûüòû
10/10/2016, 12:31 - Cindy LEUNG: Ofc if I go up and ask them, ofc none of this is happening
10/10/2016, 12:31 - Cindy LEUNG: But seriously what are the chances
10/10/2016, 12:31 - Mom: reaonable guess
10/10/2016, 12:32 - Mom: brits !!!
10/10/2016, 12:32 - Mom: and race seems a rlly big issue
10/10/2016, 12:32 - Cindy LEUNG: If I found a couple of mixed flats I would be chiller
10/10/2016, 12:33 - Mom: don't give a shit la
10/10/2016, 12:33 - Mom: don't waste time
10/10/2016, 12:33 - Cindy LEUNG: I'm really angry, this is not ok
10/10/2016, 12:34 - Mom: only solution is to move

11/10/2016, 12:21 - Mom: yeah
11/10/2016, 12:21 - Mom: he went to ucsd and then stanford
11/10/2016, 12:22 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea he was a badass
11/10/2016, 12:22 - Cindy LEUNG: U make me feel bad again
11/10/2016, 12:22 - Mom: sigh...
11/10/2016, 12:22 - Cindy LEUNG: üò¢
11/10/2016, 12:22 - Cindy LEUNG: Hahah
11/10/2016, 12:22 - Cindy LEUNG: Let's forget abt ucsd
11/10/2016, 12:23 - Mom: he did biochemist, which is good at ucsd
11/10/2016, 12:23 - Cindy LEUNG: What he did biochemistry?
11/10/2016, 12:23 - Mom: google it
11/10/2016, 12:23 - Cindy LEUNG: He did phd comp sci at Columbia
11/10/2016, 12:23 - Mom: i read it from wiki
11/10/2016, 12:23 - Cindy LEUNG: Well anyways
11/10/2016, 12:24 - Cindy LEUNG: Proves u need a PhD to do real stuff
11/10/2016, 12:24 - Cindy LEUNG: Sigh
11/10/2016, 12:24 - Cindy LEUNG: Ok thank god I didn't blow my funds
11/10/2016, 12:25 - Mom: hahaha
11/10/2016, 12:26 - Cindy LEUNG: Masters seems like a necessity nowadays
11/10/2016, 12:26 - Mom: ofc
11/10/2016, 12:26 - Cindy LEUNG: Unless u want a sales job
11/10/2016, 12:26 - Mom: at least a masters
11/10/2016, 12:27 - Cindy LEUNG: So graduate is basic an unskilled worker
11/10/2016, 12:27 - Cindy LEUNG: I see why so many ppl regret getting degree now
11/10/2016, 12:27 - Mom: no first deg
11/10/2016, 12:27 - Mom: how come u get a masters
11/10/2016, 12:28 - Cindy LEUNG: There r ppl who plan to get undergrad an be done with studying
11/10/2016, 12:29 - Cindy LEUNG: And then u end up in not a substantially better position than if u hadn't done the degree (they don't learn anything anyways) and student debt
11/10/2016, 12:29 - Cindy LEUNG: I see why Masters students r much more serious
11/10/2016, 12:30 - Cindy LEUNG: They're like a different bunch
11/10/2016, 12:30 - Mom: but the point is u need a good first deg for a second good university
11/10/2016, 12:32 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea
11/10/2016, 12:33 - Cindy LEUNG: So I see internship is not that important at this level right?
11/10/2016, 12:33 - Cindy LEUNG: If I do social work or like entrepreneurship stuff that's pretty much equivalent right?
11/10/2016, 12:33 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz I plan to do masters after anyways
11/10/2016, 12:34 - Cindy LEUNG: I'm thinking right now maybe research experience is more crucial cuz the Americans really focus on that
11/10/2016, 12:34 - Cindy LEUNG: What do you think?
11/10/2016, 12:35 - Mom: ü§îü§îü§î
11/10/2016, 12:37 - Mom: if u can find summer internship, that's a work experience that u can have touch of the real financial market
11/10/2016, 12:37 - Mom: but even if no internship, not a rlly big deal
11/10/2016, 12:38 - Mom: cuz u wud go to masters right after lse rite?
11/10/2016, 12:38 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea
11/10/2016, 12:38 - Cindy LEUNG: Some people work and then go back to Masters
11/10/2016, 12:38 - Mom: yea
11/10/2016, 12:38 - Cindy LEUNG: But then that's like interruption of career path?
11/10/2016, 12:38 - Mom: doesn't matter
11/10/2016, 12:38 - Mom: not rlly
11/10/2016, 12:38 - Cindy LEUNG: Really?
11/10/2016, 12:39 - Cindy LEUNG: But don't u need to build network and stuff
11/10/2016, 12:39 - Mom: cuz ppl want to have a sense of the job market and then determine whether they shud go further in that direction or not
11/10/2016, 12:39 - Cindy LEUNG: I see
11/10/2016, 12:40 - Cindy LEUNG: So maybe they do grad program and then go back to school?
11/10/2016, 12:40 - Mom: so ppl sometimes change their career after doing masters deg
11/10/2016, 12:40 - Cindy LEUNG: I see
11/10/2016, 12:40 - Cindy LEUNG: So people who do that r career switchers?
11/10/2016, 12:41 - Cindy LEUNG: Or they want to boost their profile?
11/10/2016, 12:41 - Mom: both
11/10/2016, 12:41 - Cindy LEUNG: But I want to do high tech stuff
11/10/2016, 12:41 - Cindy LEUNG: So I should continue studying right?
11/10/2016, 12:42 - Mom: yes
11/10/2016, 12:42 - Cindy LEUNG: I see
11/10/2016, 12:42 - Mom: better to continue ur master or even phd
11/10/2016, 12:42 - Cindy LEUNG: I've been thinking of what to talk abt with advisor tmr

11/10/2016, 12:43 - Cindy LEUNG: Dunno
11/10/2016, 12:43 - Cindy LEUNG: Where to find research experience
11/10/2016, 12:44 - Mom: ppl do research only at masters studies
11/10/2016, 12:45 - Mom: just follow the main path - go find  internship if u can
11/10/2016, 12:46 - Mom: but unsuccessful, find other volunteer work experience
11/10/2016, 12:46 - Mom: like un experience
11/10/2016, 12:47 - Cindy LEUNG: Well I already found volunteer stuff
11/10/2016, 12:49 - Mom: what's that?
11/10/2016, 12:49 - Cindy LEUNG: Enactus
11/10/2016, 12:50 - Cindy LEUNG: Its quite easy to find volunteer stuff for me cuz I hv a lot of skills...

11/10/2016, 12:51 - Mom: i wud advise u to find summer internship as well cuz that's a rather good add-on to ur profile if u can go to some reputable organisation
11/10/2016, 12:51 - Cindy LEUNG: A lot of my friends are going back to learn mando
11/10/2016, 12:52 - Mom: cuz they're preparing to go back china for jobs

13/10/2016, 08:13 - Mom: Its been 1 1/2 months, u wud hv difficulties catching up with the ma5hs course
13/10/2016, 08:13 - Mom: *maths
13/10/2016, 08:30 - Mom: watch the deadline for dropping course
13/10/2016, 08:30 - Mom: Oct 10
13/10/2016, 09:40 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea but u just need advisor approval
13/10/2016, 09:40 - Cindy LEUNG: No it's been 3 weeks
13/10/2016, 09:40 - Cindy LEUNG: Its not too bad
13/10/2016, 09:40 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz he really stressed stats and metric yesterday
13/10/2016, 09:41 - Cindy LEUNG: And I know I don't hv linear algebra
13/10/2016, 09:42 - Cindy LEUNG: So I was thinking of just doing the continuation of ma107
13/10/2016, 09:42 - Cindy LEUNG: There's a 207
13/10/2016, 09:42 - Cindy LEUNG: And similar for stats
13/10/2016, 09:42 - Cindy LEUNG: I like FM but it's a grad course
13/10/2016, 09:42 - Cindy LEUNG: U can do it at any time
13/10/2016, 09:43 - Cindy LEUNG: But math is like if u don't hv them, then u can't do a lot of advanced stuff
13/10/2016, 09:43 - Mom: is maths course more important in applying comp sci at masters level?
13/10/2016, 09:43 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea definitely
13/10/2016, 09:44 - Mom: ok lah, then go ahead asap
13/10/2016, 09:44 - Cindy LEUNG: Basically I said I wanted to go down the quant path
13/10/2016, 09:44 - Cindy LEUNG: And then hr was like do you have metrics and stats
13/10/2016, 09:44 - Mom: but make sure u won't hv serious prob when u do maths prob
13/10/2016, 09:44 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea. But finance is also basically math.
13/10/2016, 09:45 - Cindy LEUNG: This year is basically math.
13/10/2016, 09:45 - Mom: is ur advisor maths base?
13/10/2016, 09:45 - Cindy LEUNG: He's an econ guy
13/10/2016, 09:45 - Mom: no maths?
13/10/2016, 09:45 - Cindy LEUNG: What u mean background?
13/10/2016, 09:46 - Mom: if no maths, disadvantage in apply grad comp sci?
13/10/2016, 09:46 - Cindy LEUNG: Not sure
13/10/2016, 09:46 - Cindy LEUNG: Here's the thing.
13/10/2016, 09:46 - Mom: i mean his major in uni? econ only or maths guy?
13/10/2016, 09:46 - Cindy LEUNG: I looked at lse grad courses
13/10/2016, 09:47 - Cindy LEUNG: And theres actually computing but only in advanced math courses
13/10/2016, 09:47 - Mom: so no comp sci in lse rite?
13/10/2016, 09:47 - Cindy LEUNG: Comp sci is really broad
13/10/2016, 09:48 - Cindy LEUNG: Ofc there r conversion masters with less maths
13/10/2016, 09:48 - Cindy LEUNG: But I'm looking at computational finance and that looks like it's very math heavy
13/10/2016, 09:49 - Mom: as u said, finance also has maths
13/10/2016, 09:49 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea
13/10/2016, 09:49 - Mom: i don't even understand the difference in maths and stat and that in finance?
13/10/2016, 09:49 - Cindy LEUNG: But by comp sci I'm not talking abt software dev
13/10/2016, 09:49 - Mom: ofc
13/10/2016, 09:50 - Mom: no more software dev
13/10/2016, 09:50 - Cindy LEUNG: I'm looking more towards algos
13/10/2016, 09:50 - Mom: what's it?
13/10/2016, 09:50 - Cindy LEUNG: Algorithms
13/10/2016, 09:51 - Mom: the base which jp morgan uses to hire ppl??
13/10/2016, 09:51 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea it's like data analytics
13/10/2016, 09:51 - Cindy LEUNG: That's stuff
13/10/2016, 09:51 - Mom: hmmm
13/10/2016, 09:51 - Cindy LEUNG: Ways to sort information
13/10/2016, 09:52 - Mom: u decide la, but is it harder or easier than finance?
13/10/2016, 09:52 - Cindy LEUNG: Dunno
13/10/2016, 09:52 - Mom: rmb u need good grades this yr
13/10/2016, 09:52 - Mom: and who's the lecturer for this course?
13/10/2016, 09:52 - Cindy LEUNG: So far fm seems easy
13/10/2016, 09:53 - Mom: rmb last yr, the maths course tutor made u so angry?
13/10/2016, 09:53 - Cindy LEUNG: My point is that there's no point in getting an good grade for finance
13/10/2016, 09:53 - Cindy LEUNG: And then I cant apply for the masters I want to do with that
13/10/2016, 09:53 - Mom: u need good grades for masters applications
13/10/2016, 09:54 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea but I'm pretty sure u need linear algebra as well
13/10/2016, 09:54 - Mom: okok
13/10/2016, 09:54 - Cindy LEUNG: So wht am I gonna do abt that?
13/10/2016, 09:54 - Mom: no linear algebra in finance course?
13/10/2016, 09:55 - Cindy LEUNG: Its called principles of finance
13/10/2016, 09:55 - Mom: ic
13/10/2016, 09:55 - Cindy LEUNG: Why would there be linear algebra
13/10/2016, 09:55 - Mom: i get ur point la
13/10/2016, 09:56 - Mom: agree with what u think
13/10/2016, 09:56 - Cindy LEUNG: Unless I do the learn it over the summer thing again
13/10/2016, 09:56 - Cindy LEUNG: Then there's the matter of accreditation
13/10/2016, 09:56 - Mom: u might need more time to do more maths to catch up with the maths course
13/10/2016, 09:57 - Mom: what accreditation prob?
13/10/2016, 09:57 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea probably üòû
13/10/2016, 09:57 - Mom: cuz three weeks is a lot in lse
13/10/2016, 09:57 - Cindy LEUNG: Like if I learn outside
13/10/2016, 09:57 - Mom: no lah
13/10/2016, 09:58 - Mom: u can't pay so much time in learning maths outside lse
13/10/2016, 09:58 - Cindy LEUNG: I mean o could just buy the textbook and do over summer, but no accreditation
13/10/2016, 09:58 - Cindy LEUNG: That's my point.
13/10/2016, 09:58 - Mom: ur now run out of time, just concentrate on ur course work
13/10/2016, 09:59 - Cindy LEUNG: Gov and econ is really not a good combo I've realised
13/10/2016, 09:59 - Mom: too much materials?
13/10/2016, 09:59 - Cindy LEUNG: No it's not quant enough and too quant at the same time.
13/10/2016, 09:59 - Cindy LEUNG: Its a good end studies course
13/10/2016, 10:00 - Cindy LEUNG: That's it.
13/10/2016, 10:00 - Mom: ok la
13/10/2016, 10:00 - Mom: if u rlly wanna to change, ask ur advisor asap
13/10/2016, 10:00 - Mom: to catch up with the course materials
13/10/2016, 10:00 - Cindy LEUNG: Hai that's why I hv linear algebra problem now
13/10/2016, 10:00 - Mom: btw, do u need textbooks??
13/10/2016, 10:01 - Mom: what linear algebra prob?
13/10/2016, 10:01 - Cindy LEUNG: From last year u mean?
13/10/2016, 10:01 - Mom: for this yr's maths course
13/10/2016, 10:01 - Cindy LEUNG: That I don't hv a required course to apply for an econ masters
13/10/2016, 10:02 - Mom: okok
13/10/2016, 10:02 - Cindy LEUNG: U know I can't even apply for econ masters at this point cuz I hv no rigorous stats and metrics
13/10/2016, 10:02 - Mom: okok
13/10/2016, 10:02 - Mom: change it la
13/10/2016, 10:02 - Mom: hurry
13/10/2016, 10:02 - Mom: no more delay
13/10/2016, 10:03 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea yea
13/10/2016, 10:03 - Mom: check for the maths timetable and go attend it immediately
13/10/2016, 10:03 - Cindy LEUNG: Changing takes a day
13/10/2016, 10:03 - Mom: just sit in
13/10/2016, 10:03 - Cindy LEUNG: Its really faat
13/10/2016, 10:03 - Cindy LEUNG: Fast

13/10/2016, 10:03 - Cindy LEUNG: I just talked to him yesterday
13/10/2016, 10:03 - Cindy LEUNG: He knows abt it
13/10/2016, 10:04 - Mom: and spend more time in doing maths to catch up the coursework
13/10/2016, 10:04 - Mom: u shud meet with him earlier
13/10/2016, 10:04 - Cindy LEUNG: he's in finland

13/10/2016, 10:07 - Cindy LEUNG: i have no politics courses this year
13/10/2016, 10:07 - Mom: econ is hard rite?
13/10/2016, 10:07 - Cindy LEUNG: ok
13/10/2016, 10:07 - Mom: take nap in the lib
13/10/2016, 10:07 - Cindy LEUNG: plus the internship stuff
13/10/2016, 10:08 - Mom: don't waste time to travel back to ur room and sleep
13/10/2016, 10:08 - Cindy LEUNG: no its just after 5pm its downhill
13/10/2016, 10:08 - Cindy LEUNG: its like no more work after that....
13/10/2016, 10:08 - Mom: for internship, don't bother too much
13/10/2016, 10:08 - Cindy LEUNG: yea i'm thinking likewise
13/10/2016, 10:08 - Mom: cuz i said that's not very important for u atm
13/10/2016, 10:08 - Cindy LEUNG: takes too much effort to go to attend those career events
13/10/2016, 10:08 - Cindy LEUNG: and do research for that crap
13/10/2016, 10:09 - Cindy LEUNG: u know they screen cvs even for career events
13/10/2016, 10:09 - Mom: don't waste too much time in that kind of career event cuz ur going to grad course
13/10/2016, 10:09 - Cindy LEUNG: kay
13/10/2016, 10:09 - Mom: just keep ur time on ur coursework
13/10/2016, 10:09 - Cindy LEUNG: i didn't tell u about merill lynch right
13/10/2016, 10:09 - Mom: career thingy just side track thing
13/10/2016, 10:10 - Cindy LEUNG: i talked to them at the fiar
13/10/2016, 10:10 - Cindy LEUNG: fair
13/10/2016, 10:10 - Cindy LEUNG: and then they were basically like
13/10/2016, 10:10 - Mom: what?
13/10/2016, 10:10 - Cindy LEUNG: if u don't have previous experience in banking don't even think about it
13/10/2016, 10:10 - Mom: hahaha
13/10/2016, 10:10 - Mom: forget abt it
13/10/2016, 10:10 - Cindy LEUNG: and yea
13/10/2016, 10:10 - Cindy LEUNG: so i forgot about it
13/10/2016, 10:10 - Cindy LEUNG: they even need experience for spring
13/10/2016, 10:11 - Cindy LEUNG: first year spring internship
13/10/2016, 10:11 - Mom: ur road is not confined to ib
13/10/2016, 10:11 - Cindy LEUNG: they cray
13/10/2016, 10:11 - Mom: chi seen
13/10/2016, 10:11 - Cindy LEUNG: all of the banks also screen cvs even just for career events
13/10/2016, 10:11 - Mom: they're saying that they need someone with relationship üò°
13/10/2016, 10:11 - Cindy LEUNG: yea literally that's what one intern told me
13/10/2016, 10:11 - Cindy LEUNG: he was like
13/10/2016, 10:12 - Mom: don't take so much concern abt the ib
13/10/2016, 10:12 - Cindy LEUNG: look through ur father, mother, uncle, antie
13/10/2016, 10:12 - Mom: see it as a little exp
13/10/2016, 10:12 - Mom: that's the game of the rule, relationship relationship and relationship
13/10/2016, 10:13 - Cindy LEUNG: yep i think i can only apply ubs at this point, cuz i've signed up for a few career events and they're the only one i've heard back from
13/10/2016, 10:13 - Mom: just concentrate on ur coursework atm, and think abt other more concrete jobs after masters level
13/10/2016, 10:13 - Cindy LEUNG: yea ok
13/10/2016, 10:14 - Mom: cuz ur not going into the market directly after first deg, rtie?
13/10/2016, 10:14 - Mom: no need to rush
13/10/2016, 10:14 - Cindy LEUNG: i've got some social entrepreneurship thing going on anyways
13/10/2016, 10:14 - Cindy LEUNG: so that's cv covered
13/10/2016, 10:14 - Cindy LEUNG: and then i'll ditch the film soc next term or something
13/10/2016, 10:14 - Mom: and u might possibly go into other tech area instead of the ib, rite?
13/10/2016, 10:14 - Mom: exactly
13/10/2016, 10:15 - Mom: assign some other person to do those film soc stuff
13/10/2016, 10:15 - Cindy LEUNG: well here's the thing
13/10/2016, 10:15 - Cindy LEUNG: since i didn't do a comp sci undergrad
13/10/2016, 10:16 - Cindy LEUNG: i think i need to follow more focused goals
13/10/2016, 10:16 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz comp sci undergrad is essentially an engineering degree
13/10/2016, 10:16 - Mom: k
13/10/2016, 10:17 - Mom: just stick to ur plan
13/10/2016, 10:17 - Mom: and don't swing away from time to time
13/10/2016, 10:17 - Mom: this is the point
13/10/2016, 10:17 - Cindy LEUNG: okie doke
13/10/2016, 10:18 - Cindy LEUNG: g2g lecture time
13/10/2016, 10:20 - Mom: kk
13/10/2016, 10:41 - Mom: don't waste time on the spring internship, apply 2 or 3 will be ok
13/10/2016, 10:42 - Mom: even if no spring internship offered, don't think it matters too much cuz ur not going directly into the workforce 2 yr later
13/10/2016, 10:53 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea ofc
13/10/2016, 10:54 - Cindy LEUNG: They only take first yr for spring anyways
13/10/2016, 10:54 - Cindy LEUNG: 2 or 3
13/10/2016, 10:54 - Cindy LEUNG: Ok
13/10/2016, 10:54 - Cindy LEUNG: I feel like this is like applying for transfer again üòÖ
13/10/2016, 11:41 - Mom: first yr? so why ur still working on the internship?
13/10/2016, 11:41 - Mom: for summer?
13/10/2016, 12:53 - Cindy LEUNG: Summer internship application is now
13/10/2016, 12:54 - Mom: oh
13/10/2016, 12:54 - Cindy LEUNG: Crazy
13/10/2016, 12:54 - Mom: ...
13/10/2016, 12:54 - Mom: why rush?
13/10/2016, 12:54 - Cindy LEUNG: Not to mention u need to do the four rounds even for internship
13/10/2016, 12:54 - Mom: most ppl don't even think of further studies?
13/10/2016, 12:54 - Mom: what? four rounds?
13/10/2016, 12:54 - Mom: omg
13/10/2016, 12:55 - Cindy LEUNG: Like u do this online thing
13/10/2016, 12:55 - Mom: then i'll apply one or two co.
13/10/2016, 12:55 - Cindy LEUNG: And then I gotta do a couple of aptitude tests
13/10/2016, 12:55 - Cindy LEUNG: And then there's interviews
13/10/2016, 12:55 - Mom: .......
13/10/2016, 12:55 - Mom: wtf
13/10/2016, 12:55 - Cindy LEUNG: And then assessment centre
13/10/2016, 12:55 - Cindy LEUNG: Ikr
13/10/2016, 12:55 - Mom: the world is going crazy
13/10/2016, 12:55 - Cindy LEUNG: Every single company is like this though
13/10/2016, 12:56 - Mom: i have never come across with this kind of competition
13/10/2016, 12:56 - Mom: i just attend two rounds interview for a post
13/10/2016, 12:57 - Cindy LEUNG: Dude u don't know how insane it is
13/10/2016, 12:58 - Cindy LEUNG: The online app is like common app basically
13/10/2016, 12:58 - Cindy LEUNG: U gotta answer why ubs or why jp Morgan
13/10/2016, 12:58 - Cindy LEUNG: Creatively
13/10/2016, 12:59 - Mom: üò©üò©üò©üò©
13/10/2016, 13:02 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea and then
13/10/2016, 13:02 - Cindy LEUNG: The interviews require a lot of prep
13/10/2016, 13:03 - Cindy LEUNG: There's the standard competency questions
13/10/2016, 13:03 - Cindy LEUNG: U know like tell us abt yourself
13/10/2016, 13:03 - Mom: i'd rather choose to do McDonalds
13/10/2016, 13:03 - Cindy LEUNG: But then they also test u on technical knowledge
13/10/2016, 13:03 - Cindy LEUNG: Wtf
13/10/2016, 13:04 - Mom: yea
13/10/2016, 13:04 - Mom: wtf
13/10/2016, 13:04 - Cindy LEUNG: Like why do u think I'm doing an internship
13/10/2016, 13:04 - Cindy LEUNG: And then
13/10/2016, 13:04 - Cindy LEUNG: There's a couple of rounds right
13/10/2016, 13:05 - Cindy LEUNG: So u gotta do group activities
13/10/2016, 13:05 - Mom: i wonder if those companies r actually hiring staff or playing ppl
13/10/2016, 13:05 - Cindy LEUNG: And then do case studies
13/10/2016, 13:05 - Cindy LEUNG: Case studies
13/10/2016, 13:05 - Mom: don't waste time on these stupid stuff
13/10/2016, 13:05 - Cindy LEUNG: I literally think u need to prep one year to apply
13/10/2016, 13:06 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea
13/10/2016, 13:06 - Cindy LEUNG: Abd at the end of the day, u get a freaking sales position
13/10/2016, 13:06 - Cindy LEUNG: This is the unskilled labor market
13/10/2016, 13:06 - Mom: ur just going for intern
13/10/2016, 13:07 - Mom: those companies r not guarantee u guys permanent post after grad
13/10/2016, 13:07 - Cindy LEUNG: Well cuz interns usually get conversion
13/10/2016, 13:07 - Mom: don't waste time
13/10/2016, 13:07 - Mom: not necessary
13/10/2016, 13:07 - Cindy LEUNG: But then they'll also fire you in a few years time
13/10/2016, 13:08 - Mom: how can a second yr student spare so much time preparing for this exercise
13/10/2016, 13:08 - Mom: they need to get good grades, particularly in yr2
13/10/2016, 13:09 - Cindy LEUNG: Well thats why they only require 2:1
13/10/2016, 13:09 - Cindy LEUNG: They don't need Ur uni education basically
13/10/2016, 13:09 - Cindy LEUNG: Those people r basically unskilled
13/10/2016, 13:09 - Mom: the fact is to get a first hon is not easy
13/10/2016, 13:10 - Mom: uni can't give everyone a first even if they're all genius
13/10/2016, 13:10 - Mom: cuz ur uni knowledge doesn't help ur work
13/10/2016, 13:11 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea first is not easy
13/10/2016, 13:11 - Cindy LEUNG: I think masters might look for first
13/10/2016, 13:12 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz it shows u actually come here to learn
13/10/2016, 13:12 - Mom: good uni or famous unis prefer good grades student for higher deg

13/10/2016, 13:14 - Mom: hard?
13/10/2016, 13:14 - Cindy LEUNG: The prof even teaches the class
13/10/2016, 13:14 - Mom: nobody in lse wants to do maths?
13/10/2016, 13:14 - Cindy LEUNG: I dunno
13/10/2016, 13:14 - Mom: is the prof good?
13/10/2016, 13:14 - Cindy LEUNG: Its the same guy
13/10/2016, 13:14 - Mom: this is the prob??

13/10/2016, 13:16 - Mom: be prepared to work harder
13/10/2016, 13:16 - Cindy LEUNG: I should focus on academic
13/10/2016, 13:16 - Mom: ur not sales person
13/10/2016, 13:16 - Mom: better
13/10/2016, 13:16 - Mom: at least u can still go into ib after masters or phd
13/10/2016, 13:17 - Mom: but then i think u wud choose a different career
13/10/2016, 13:17 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea tbh I think they would be more keen to hire masters students right?
13/10/2016, 13:17 - Mom: consultancy is also sales
13/10/2016, 13:17 - Mom: dunno
13/10/2016, 13:18 - Mom: but u have more time to prepare for those many many rounds interview
13/10/2016, 13:18 - Cindy LEUNG: I dunno, Im looking at those positions and I think structuralist looks interesting
13/10/2016, 13:18 - Cindy LEUNG: But they go under sales
13/10/2016, 13:19 - Mom: structuralists r supporting staff then
13/10/2016, 13:19 - Cindy LEUNG: No they make the financial products
13/10/2016, 13:19 - Mom: oh
13/10/2016, 13:19 - Cindy LEUNG: Supporting staff is back office
13/10/2016, 13:19 - Mom: some days later, they'll be sales as well
13/10/2016, 13:19 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea
13/10/2016, 13:19 - Mom: nvm
13/10/2016, 13:19 - Cindy LEUNG: Well they r part of the sales team
13/10/2016, 13:20 - Mom: as least u have time to suit the environment first
13/10/2016, 13:20 - Cindy LEUNG: I see why the ubs guy says they do everything noe
13/10/2016, 13:20 - Mom: tbh only sales persons survive at the end
13/10/2016, 13:20 - Mom: cuz a company need revenue
13/10/2016, 13:21 - Cindy LEUNG: Well trader and researcher is also front office
13/10/2016, 13:21 - Mom: doctors r also sales in the end, rite?
13/10/2016, 13:21 - Cindy LEUNG: But the European market is so regulated now
13/10/2016, 13:21 - Mom: so?
13/10/2016, 13:21 - Cindy LEUNG: So many compliance rules
13/10/2016, 13:21 - Mom: u still need to do compliance work
13/10/2016, 13:21 - Mom: yea
13/10/2016, 13:21 - Cindy LEUNG: And monitoring
13/10/2016, 13:22 - Mom: this is legal la
13/10/2016, 13:22 - Cindy LEUNG: I feel like trader could very easily be replaced by machine
13/10/2016, 13:22 - Mom: hmmm
13/10/2016, 13:22 - Mom: questionable??
13/10/2016, 13:22 - Cindy LEUNG: At the end of the day, they just give quotes
13/10/2016, 13:23 - Mom: those r floor traders
13/10/2016, 13:23 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea those r wht I mean by tradee
13/10/2016, 13:23 - Cindy LEUNG: They make deals
13/10/2016, 13:23 - Mom: u maybe rite cuz online trading is getting popular
13/10/2016, 13:24 - Cindy LEUNG: Basically generate revenue through spread
13/10/2016, 13:24 - Cindy LEUNG: Thats something like even I could potentially write a simple code for
13/10/2016, 13:24 - Mom: u can't widen the spread too much
13/10/2016, 13:25 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea but u jist follow general rules right
13/10/2016, 13:25 - Cindy LEUNG: Like if demand is at this point, then make spread this percent
13/10/2016, 13:25 - Mom: i think companies aim at creating more new products
13/10/2016, 13:26 - Mom: anyway, skills r transferable between industries
13/10/2016, 13:26 - Cindy LEUNG: Out of trader, sales and research I feel like trader is more susceptible imo
13/10/2016, 13:26 - Mom: so i advise u to do research in the first place
13/10/2016, 13:27 - Cindy LEUNG: Research
13/10/2016, 13:27 - Cindy LEUNG: Aha
13/10/2016, 13:27 - Cindy LEUNG: U see they don't actually produce research as per say
13/10/2016, 13:27 - Cindy LEUNG: I feel like they r more like PR ppl
13/10/2016, 13:28 - Mom: this research doesn't mean scientific research
13/10/2016, 13:28 - Cindy LEUNG: I guess they produce research which incentives people to trade
13/10/2016, 13:28 - Mom: they just go do pr thingy and collect insider info
13/10/2016, 13:28 - Mom: hahaha
13/10/2016, 13:29 - Cindy LEUNG: ... I think corporate intelligence is more suitable title
13/10/2016, 13:29 - Mom: yea they'll produce research paper in the end but with a  definite intention or purpose
13/10/2016, 13:29 - Cindy LEUNG: Like those ppl who talk on tv
13/10/2016, 13:29 - Mom: that purpose is not to give advise to potential investors
13/10/2016, 13:30 - Cindy LEUNG: Its like native advertising
13/10/2016, 13:30 - Mom: yea
13/10/2016, 13:30 - Mom: sort of
13/10/2016, 13:30 - Cindy LEUNG: PR is evil
13/10/2016, 13:30 - Mom: advertising +
13/10/2016, 13:30 - Mom: ÈÄ†Â∏Ç
13/10/2016, 13:31 - Cindy LEUNG: I think I would do that stuff
13/10/2016, 13:31 - Mom: üëç
13/10/2016, 13:31 - Cindy LEUNG: But I don't want to get involved in that crap again
13/10/2016, 13:31 - Mom: u got to be very good liar

14/10/2016, 17:57 - Mom: yea private gp
14/10/2016, 17:57 - Cindy LEUNG: Or I'll just go to NHS to ask them for referral
14/10/2016, 17:57 - Mom: like what we did in hk at the ocean park time

14/10/2016, 18:00 - Mom: then u need medical paper
14/10/2016, 18:00 - Cindy LEUNG: I feel like anything at 9, I hv severe disadvantage
14/10/2016, 18:00 - Cindy LEUNG: The earliest I can manage is 10am I swear
14/10/2016, 18:00 - Mom: same situation for these 3 weeks?
14/10/2016, 18:01 - Cindy LEUNG: Well yah.
14/10/2016, 18:01 - Cindy LEUNG: I only had two weeks of classes so far
14/10/2016, 18:01 - Cindy LEUNG: And both Thursdays were baad
14/10/2016, 18:01 - Cindy LEUNG: And then last Friday I barely slept at night
14/10/2016, 18:01 - Mom: no sleep?
14/10/2016, 18:01 - Mom: why?
14/10/2016, 18:01 - Cindy LEUNG: This Friday I thought I'd be better, but still bad
14/10/2016, 18:02 - Cindy LEUNG: Remember the night I talked to u on the phone?
14/10/2016, 18:02 - Mom: if u didn't sleep, how's ur day on Saturday?

14/10/2016, 18:02 - Mom: don't feel tired?
14/10/2016, 18:02 - Mom: ....
14/10/2016, 18:02 - Cindy LEUNG: Wednesday is still productive
14/10/2016, 18:02 - Mom: so weird
14/10/2016, 18:03 - Cindy LEUNG: Thursday just needed to sleep all day
14/10/2016, 18:03 - Cindy LEUNG: And then Friday cannot operate
14/10/2016, 18:03 - Mom: ok
14/10/2016, 18:03 - Cindy LEUNG: I think it might be the morning nap
14/10/2016, 18:03 - Mom: the situation is: if u didn't sleep much, u can operate quite normal
14/10/2016, 18:03 - Cindy LEUNG: C uz on Thurs and fri
14/10/2016, 18:04 - Cindy LEUNG: I have stuff at 9 or 10
14/10/2016, 18:04 - Mom: but if u sleep alot, u can't do things
14/10/2016, 18:04 - Cindy LEUNG: No I think because I skipped the morning nap
14/10/2016, 18:04 - Cindy LEUNG: And then I couldn't function for the day
14/10/2016, 18:04 - Mom: how long u need morning nap to help u function well?
14/10/2016, 18:05 - Cindy LEUNG: Something abt the first nap, gives me energy
14/10/2016, 18:05 - Cindy LEUNG: Like 10-20 min? Its the one after breakfast
14/10/2016, 18:05 - Mom: is that u wake up too early in the morning, so need a morning nap?
14/10/2016, 18:06 - Cindy LEUNG: Hmm
14/10/2016, 18:06 - Cindy LEUNG: I wake up naturally around 7
14/10/2016, 18:06 - Cindy LEUNG: So I don't think so
14/10/2016, 18:06 - Cindy LEUNG: ESP yesterday, shouldn't be lack of sleep
14/10/2016, 18:06 - Mom: what time u take breakfast?
14/10/2016, 18:07 - Cindy LEUNG: No breakfast
14/10/2016, 18:07 - Mom: everyday?
14/10/2016, 18:07 - Cindy LEUNG: Only depends
14/10/2016, 18:07 - Cindy LEUNG: Like sometimes I eat stuff cuz I bought it the day before
14/10/2016, 18:07 - Mom: what if u took breakfast, did u fall asleep in class?
14/10/2016, 18:07 - Cindy LEUNG: Mostly yogurt
14/10/2016, 18:07 - Cindy LEUNG: Hmmm
14/10/2016, 18:07 - Cindy LEUNG: Not sure, will hv to try
14/10/2016, 18:08 - Cindy LEUNG: But I tend to sleep immediately after breakfast
14/10/2016, 18:08 - Cindy LEUNG: So I might miss class
14/10/2016, 18:08 - Mom: even if no food, just take a cup of hot chocolate or whatever
14/10/2016, 18:08 - Cindy LEUNG: My point is I don't think it helps me wake up
14/10/2016, 18:08 - Cindy LEUNG: But rather breakfast helps me get the first nap
14/10/2016, 18:09 - Cindy LEUNG: My eyes r literally hurting at this point
14/10/2016, 18:09 - Cindy LEUNG: I think it's due to lack of sleep
14/10/2016, 18:09 - Mom: if that's the case, try to eat breakfast b4 0730 and take nap during 0730 to 0830
14/10/2016, 18:09 - Cindy LEUNG: Hmm ok
14/10/2016, 18:10 - Mom: take a rest first cuz ur eyes r telling u to rest
14/10/2016, 18:10 - Cindy LEUNG: I've already taken a lot of rest
14/10/2016, 18:10 - Cindy LEUNG: It doesn't work
14/10/2016, 18:10 - Cindy LEUNG: It has to be those special naps
14/10/2016, 18:10 - Mom: but ur eyes r not working
14/10/2016, 18:10 - Mom: u need to follow it
14/10/2016, 18:11 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea I skip one and my body in jeopardy
14/10/2016, 18:11 - Mom: just close ur eyes for them to rest
14/10/2016, 18:11 - Cindy LEUNG: I think those short naps get rid of sleep toxins
14/10/2016, 18:11 - Mom: maybe
14/10/2016, 18:11 - Cindy LEUNG: Like I thought this last year already when I tried the pramiracetam
14/10/2016, 18:12 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz that speeds up processes on the brain
14/10/2016, 18:12 - Cindy LEUNG: And I had a short nap after taking that, and I could feel my brain doing a lot of work
14/10/2016, 18:12 - Cindy LEUNG: Like a whirring CPU
14/10/2016, 18:13 - Mom: but u can't depend on that for long time
14/10/2016, 18:13 - Cindy LEUNG: Yeah if I see a private doc, can I tell them this stuff?
14/10/2016, 18:13 - Mom: u tried pramiracetam thing?
14/10/2016, 18:14 - Cindy LEUNG: Well yea
14/10/2016, 18:14 - Mom: not ok ah
14/10/2016, 18:14 - Cindy LEUNG: Its not illegal
14/10/2016, 18:14 - Cindy LEUNG: I need an OTC doctor seriously
14/10/2016, 18:14 - Mom: ur telling ppl u took drug which probably can't be covered by normal insurance
14/10/2016, 18:15 - Cindy LEUNG: Right I see
14/10/2016, 18:15 - Cindy LEUNG: U gotta point
14/10/2016, 18:15 - Cindy LEUNG: I'll try find a med student
14/10/2016, 18:15 - Cindy LEUNG: On wbsa
14/10/2016, 18:44 - Mom: just read some website, vision colour change is a suggestion of blood glucose level changes??
14/10/2016, 20:18 - Cindy LEUNG: We tested glucose
14/10/2016, 20:18 - Cindy LEUNG: There's no prob
14/10/2016, 20:18 - Cindy LEUNG: I just took nap in bed
14/10/2016, 20:18 - Cindy LEUNG: Sure enough, had nightmare
14/10/2016, 20:23 - Mom: yea, ur blood glucose level in ur body is normal, but we don't know if this is the same level at ur brain???
14/10/2016, 20:23 - Mom: what nightmare is it?
14/10/2016, 20:34 - Cindy LEUNG: Like vivid stuff
14/10/2016, 20:34 - Cindy LEUNG: I turned into a mermaid and went under sea
14/10/2016, 20:34 - Cindy LEUNG: And then all the fish attacked me
14/10/2016, 20:36 - Cindy LEUNG: and falling
14/10/2016, 20:36 - Cindy LEUNG: there's always falling
14/10/2016, 20:36 - Cindy LEUNG: i had three dreams
14/10/2016, 20:36 - Cindy LEUNG: before i gave up on naping
14/10/2016, 20:36 - Cindy LEUNG: now my eye is fine now though, the rem sleep got rid of something inside it which increased the pressure in it
14/10/2016, 20:37 - Mom: Ur dreams always contains being attacked by others
14/10/2016, 20:37 - Cindy LEUNG: so we know for sure now that rem sleep, seems to get rid of something inside my eyes/ probably extending to head
14/10/2016, 20:37 - Cindy LEUNG: yea
14/10/2016, 20:38 - Cindy LEUNG: my dreams always contains being attacked at the end
14/10/2016, 20:38 - Cindy LEUNG: and falling
14/10/2016, 20:38 - Mom: It must be stress
14/10/2016, 20:38 - Cindy LEUNG: feeling of falling is really vivid
14/10/2016, 20:38 - Cindy LEUNG: like i've never been in free fall before, so i don't even know how the brain knows how to recreate this experience
14/10/2016, 20:38 - Mom: Cuz that's ur heart reaction
14/10/2016, 20:39 - Cindy LEUNG: hmm, could be
14/10/2016, 20:39 - Cindy LEUNG: that's a reasonable guess
14/10/2016, 20:40 - Cindy LEUNG: and then it's when i notice that its a dream they start attacking me.
14/10/2016, 20:41 - Cindy LEUNG: and then i pull out (i.e. wake up) - and can't move
14/10/2016, 20:41 - Cindy LEUNG: i think i induce the sleep paralysis by not waking up naturally.
14/10/2016, 20:41 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz i sort of think myself awake
14/10/2016, 20:41 - Mom: i told u that i watched a tv program abt sleep science in which the professor from harvard med school said that ur dream content must have some relations with ur dialy experience
14/10/2016, 20:41 - Cindy LEUNG: ....
14/10/2016, 20:41 - Cindy LEUNG: why
14/10/2016, 20:42 - Mom: he didn't explain why
14/10/2016, 20:42 - Mom: he just said so
14/10/2016, 20:42 - Cindy LEUNG: must know why
14/10/2016, 20:43 - Mom: he said our daily experience is stored in our brain in separate pictures, like u does editing for a film
14/10/2016, 20:43 - Cindy LEUNG: hmmm
14/10/2016, 20:43 - Cindy LEUNG: okay i know what he means
14/10/2016, 20:43 - Mom: and then different scene come up up brain without any meaning
14/10/2016, 20:43 - Cindy LEUNG: yes i think i've said this before as well
14/10/2016, 20:43 - Cindy LEUNG: like about half a year ago
14/10/2016, 20:44 - Mom: and then ur long term memories and the hippocampus try to form relations and create dream which we might not be familiar with
14/10/2016, 20:44 - Cindy LEUNG: yea like it's all in little bits
14/10/2016, 20:44 - Cindy LEUNG: and then u use association/ tags to find stuff
14/10/2016, 20:44 - Mom: that explains why u had falling and attack dreams
14/10/2016, 20:44 - Cindy LEUNG: why?
14/10/2016, 20:45 - Cindy LEUNG: don't get it
14/10/2016, 20:45 - Mom: u had memories of falling, attacking events
14/10/2016, 20:45 - Mom: and then ur brain forms new stories abt them
14/10/2016, 20:45 - Cindy LEUNG: no, never fell before
14/10/2016, 20:45 - Cindy LEUNG: anyways even if i have 'fallen' before, say i.e. ride roller coaster
14/10/2016, 20:45 - Mom: but u have seen movies abt falling rite?
14/10/2016, 20:45 - Cindy LEUNG: that's only one memories
14/10/2016, 20:45 - Cindy LEUNG: one memory
14/10/2016, 20:46 - Mom: and u learn of what falling means
14/10/2016, 20:46 - Cindy LEUNG: it doesn't make sense for it to keep pulling up falling
14/10/2016, 20:46 - Cindy LEUNG: why does it keep pulling up falling
14/10/2016, 20:46 - Cindy LEUNG: or falling is a main link in my brain?
14/10/2016, 20:46 - Mom: i think the events or experience not necessary come from personal experience
14/10/2016, 20:46 - Cindy LEUNG: hmm ok
14/10/2016, 20:47 - Mom: ur brain cud generate it by ur learning
14/10/2016, 20:47 - Cindy LEUNG: but still
14/10/2016, 20:47 - Cindy LEUNG: ok i did physics
14/10/2016, 20:47 - Cindy LEUNG: that's about all the falling i know
14/10/2016, 20:47 - Cindy LEUNG: its' not like i have dreams about javascript
14/10/2016, 20:48 - Cindy LEUNG: i looked at that like everyday during the summer
14/10/2016, 20:48 - Mom: no
14/10/2016, 20:48 - Cindy LEUNG: and u don't have dreams about bubble worlds
14/10/2016, 20:48 - Mom: falling doesn't necessary mean physical falling experience
14/10/2016, 20:48 - Mom: in ur dream, it's kind of representation of ur emotions
14/10/2016, 20:48 - Cindy LEUNG: ok
14/10/2016, 20:49 - Mom: so falling might have some reference to ur emotions right now?
14/10/2016, 20:49 - Mom: but what does it mean?
14/10/2016, 20:49 - Mom: what kind of emotions?
14/10/2016, 20:49 - Mom: fear? worries? or anxiety?
14/10/2016, 20:49 - Mom: it's logical
14/10/2016, 20:49 - Cindy LEUNG: as in the link is logical?
14/10/2016, 20:49 - Mom: because ur now in a state of unstable emotions all the time
14/10/2016, 20:49 - Cindy LEUNG: i agree its linked with emotions
14/10/2016, 20:50 - Cindy LEUNG: because the dream state is a very emotion dominated state
14/10/2016, 20:50 - Mom: yes
14/10/2016, 20:50 - Cindy LEUNG: so following ur line of argument
14/10/2016, 20:50 - Cindy LEUNG: once i realise its a dream
14/10/2016, 20:50 - Cindy LEUNG: my emotions change
14/10/2016, 20:50 - Cindy LEUNG: that's why those fish attack me
14/10/2016, 20:51 - Mom: no, those fish attacking u is a kind of ur emotion
14/10/2016, 20:51 - Cindy LEUNG: yea i mean, as in the fish suddenly attacking me is a representation of change in emotion/
14/10/2016, 20:52 - Mom: dunno what u mean change of emotion? but anyway it represents ur different emotion
14/10/2016, 20:52 - Cindy LEUNG: like once i realise its a dream
14/10/2016, 20:53 - Cindy LEUNG: my emotions change
14/10/2016, 20:53 - Mom: rmb that ur dreams always full of being attacked by objects
14/10/2016, 20:53 - Cindy LEUNG: like i probably get scared
14/10/2016, 20:53 - Mom: this is kind of consistency
14/10/2016, 20:53 - Cindy LEUNG: yea
14/10/2016, 20:53 - Cindy LEUNG: i think being attacked represents fear
14/10/2016, 20:54 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz my instinctive response is flight
14/10/2016, 20:54 - Mom: how can u tell urself that u know u were dreaming in a dream?
14/10/2016, 20:54 - Cindy LEUNG: i dunno, i think i get closer to the awake level and i just 'realize' its a dream
14/10/2016, 20:55 - Mom: those nightmare or bad dream ususally happen at the end of ur sleep?
14/10/2016, 20:55 - Cindy LEUNG: end
14/10/2016, 20:55 - Cindy LEUNG: always get attacked at the end
14/10/2016, 20:55 - Mom: ic
14/10/2016, 20:56 - Cindy LEUNG: for the third dream
14/10/2016, 20:56 - Cindy LEUNG: i was face down on the pillow
14/10/2016, 20:56 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz i couldn't move because of sleep para from waking up from the second dream
14/10/2016, 20:56 - Cindy LEUNG: and i saw green and black stripes
14/10/2016, 20:57 - Cindy LEUNG: and then there was a big black gap in the middle
14/10/2016, 20:57 - Cindy LEUNG: and then i was falling through it
14/10/2016, 20:57 - Mom: ur talking abt what u saw in ur dream?
14/10/2016, 20:57 - Cindy LEUNG: yes, it only lasted like 10 seconds cuz i was falling and then i knew it was going to be good
14/10/2016, 20:58 - Cindy LEUNG: so i forced myself to open my eyes and roll on the floor
14/10/2016, 20:58 - Cindy LEUNG: that's how i get p
14/10/2016, 20:58 - Cindy LEUNG: up
14/10/2016, 20:58 - Mom: why on the floor?
14/10/2016, 20:58 - Mom: fell on the floor from ur bed?
14/10/2016, 20:58 - Cindy LEUNG: no, i kind of drag each limb at a time
14/10/2016, 20:59 - Cindy LEUNG: and force myself out of the bed
14/10/2016, 20:59 - Cindy LEUNG: once i'm off the bed, i can normally move freely again
14/10/2016, 20:59 - Mom: why don't just wait unless ur fully conscious?
14/10/2016, 20:59 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz i forced my brain to wake up from the dream
14/10/2016, 20:59 - Cindy LEUNG: and then my body hasn't waken yet
14/10/2016, 21:00 - Cindy LEUNG: so if i don't move the body, then i'll go back to sleep
14/10/2016, 21:00 - Mom: ...
14/10/2016, 21:00 - Cindy LEUNG: and then continue nightmare or start new one
14/10/2016, 21:00 - Cindy LEUNG: i'm afraid of being attacked
14/10/2016, 21:00 - Cindy LEUNG: so i get up no matter what
14/10/2016, 21:00 - Mom: why just nap on the chair?
14/10/2016, 21:00 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz it's not as restful
14/10/2016, 21:00 - Cindy LEUNG: the effect is not the same
14/10/2016, 21:01 - Cindy LEUNG: these naps are special
14/10/2016, 21:01 - Mom: but ur kind of going into a vicious cycle
14/10/2016, 21:01 - Cindy LEUNG: yea i think so to
14/10/2016, 21:02 - Mom: ur afraid of the bed and u need the bed
14/10/2016, 21:02 - Cindy LEUNG: i feel that i'm partly causing these sleep paralysis as well
14/10/2016, 21:02 - Mom: even though u sleep on the bed, ur nap aren't restful cuz u wud have nightmares
14/10/2016, 21:02 - Cindy LEUNG: no that's different
14/10/2016, 21:03 - Cindy LEUNG: i REMed, so it was restful
14/10/2016, 21:03 - Cindy LEUNG: something happened in the brain, so my eyes don't hurt now
14/10/2016, 21:03 - Mom: feeling restful after bad dreams or nightmares?
14/10/2016, 21:03 - Cindy LEUNG: so physiologically, it was a restfull sleep
14/10/2016, 21:03 - Cindy LEUNG: but maybe in term of mentally, it wasn't
14/10/2016, 21:04 - Mom: did u lay down on bed or just sit on the bed for nap?
14/10/2016, 21:05 - Cindy LEUNG: lay down
14/10/2016, 21:05 - Mom: and when u said ur face down on the pillow, is there any lack of oxygen feeling?
14/10/2016, 21:05 - Cindy LEUNG: no it was only for a brief moment that i was in that position
14/10/2016, 21:10 - Cindy LEUNG: so yea
14/10/2016, 23:40 - Cindy LEUNG: I just tried sleeping again
14/10/2016, 23:41 - Cindy LEUNG: No good
15/10/2016, 00:23 - Mom: Nightmare again?
15/10/2016, 00:23 - Mom: Do stuff la
15/10/2016, 00:23 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea
15/10/2016, 00:23 - Cindy LEUNG: I saw a happy face smiley
15/10/2016, 00:24 - Cindy LEUNG: And then it turned evil looking
15/10/2016, 00:24 - Mom: ...
15/10/2016, 00:24 - Cindy LEUNG: And then I saw shadow of hands on the wall
15/10/2016, 00:24 - Cindy LEUNG: Cast from my clothes on the clothes rack
15/10/2016, 00:25 - Mom: ...
15/10/2016, 00:25 - Mom: Do some other stuff
15/10/2016, 00:27 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea
15/10/2016, 00:27 - Cindy LEUNG: I tried to watch lecture and then my head started hurting and all the words became bright green
15/10/2016, 00:27 - Cindy LEUNG: After 30 mins
15/10/2016, 00:28 - Cindy LEUNG: So I gave up on that too
15/10/2016, 00:28 - Mom: Wtf
15/10/2016, 00:28 - Cindy LEUNG: I'm doing society stuff atm
15/10/2016, 00:31 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea literally all my lecture notes turned green
15/10/2016, 00:31 - Cindy LEUNG: I even flipped the page and the next page was green as well
15/10/2016, 00:32 - Cindy LEUNG: But then my laptop had a black edge and when I looked at that, it didn't turn green
15/10/2016, 00:33 - Mom: No panic
15/10/2016, 00:33 - Mom: Its the cones inside ur eyes that become tired
15/10/2016, 00:34 - Mom: So they turn normal after rest
15/10/2016, 00:34 - Mom: Close ur eyes for rest
15/10/2016, 00:35 - Mom: U probably not seeing it
15/10/2016, 00:35 - Cindy LEUNG: U think so
15/10/2016, 00:35 - Cindy LEUNG: Ok
15/10/2016, 00:35 - Cindy LEUNG: Why green though
15/10/2016, 00:35 - Cindy LEUNG: And I never had this before
15/10/2016, 00:36 - Mom: Not what i think
15/10/2016, 00:36 - Mom: I learnt it from those website
15/10/2016, 00:36 - Mom: I know
15/10/2016, 00:36 - Cindy LEUNG: Ok
15/10/2016, 00:37 - Mom: Thats why i told u see eye doc
15/10/2016, 00:38 - Cindy LEUNG: Right
15/10/2016, 00:38 - Cindy LEUNG: I sees
15/10/2016, 00:38 - Cindy LEUNG: Or not
15/10/2016, 00:38 - Cindy LEUNG: Hahaha
15/10/2016, 00:39 - Mom: Go to nhs ask if they can refer u to eye doc
15/10/2016, 00:40 - Cindy LEUNG: I think so too
15/10/2016, 00:41 - Cindy LEUNG: But then they'd be like I think it's just eye strain
15/10/2016, 00:41 - Cindy LEUNG: She was going to say that
15/10/2016, 00:41 - Cindy LEUNG: I saw her
15/10/2016, 00:41 - Cindy LEUNG: Until I said they were migraines
15/10/2016, 00:43 - Mom: Vision color change + migraines
15/10/2016, 00:43 - Mom: Need to chk with eye doc la
15/10/2016, 00:44 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea I hv so much hope for nhs
15/10/2016, 00:45 - Mom: Did u hv these incidents during the summer in hk
15/10/2016, 00:45 - Cindy LEUNG: Probably once or twice
15/10/2016, 00:45 - Cindy LEUNG: The migraines yes
15/10/2016, 00:46 - Mom: Vision color change?
15/10/2016, 00:46 - Cindy LEUNG: None
15/10/2016, 00:46 - Cindy LEUNG: Maybe once
15/10/2016, 00:47 - Mom: U had been doing alot of learning over the summer, still looked ok
15/10/2016, 00:47 - Mom: But then when ur back to uk
15/10/2016, 00:48 - Mom: Things seems dont go alright
15/10/2016, 00:48 - Mom: Is this something related to emotions?
15/10/2016, 00:49 - Cindy LEUNG: Definitely doing a lot more studying here
15/10/2016, 00:49 - Cindy LEUNG: What I did over the summer was lightweight
15/10/2016, 00:49 - Mom: Ok
15/10/2016, 00:49 - Cindy LEUNG: I pretty much just spent three weeks trying to choose courses for nu
15/10/2016, 00:50 - Mom: This means ur threshold is just at low level
15/10/2016, 00:51 - Mom: But u still work on ur computer for the whole day
15/10/2016, 00:52 - Cindy LEUNG: I don't think it's to do with computer
15/10/2016, 00:52 - Cindy LEUNG: Its not strain on eyes
15/10/2016, 00:53 - Cindy LEUNG: Its just too much logical thinking
15/10/2016, 00:54 - Mom: Ic
15/10/2016, 01:09 - Mom: Take taurine ah
15/10/2016, 01:09 - Cindy LEUNG: Ok
15/10/2016, 01:09 - Cindy LEUNG: Wow it's 1
15/10/2016, 01:09 - Mom: Yea
15/10/2016, 04:14 - Mom: hi
15/10/2016, 04:14 - Mom: wake up now?
15/10/2016, 04:15 - Cindy LEUNG: Hi
15/10/2016, 04:15 - Cindy LEUNG: Yes
15/10/2016, 04:15 - Mom: u just slept for 3 hrs rite?
15/10/2016, 04:16 - Cindy LEUNG: 1-3
15/10/2016, 04:16 - Mom: woke up at 3?
15/10/2016, 04:16 - Cindy LEUNG: No two hrs
15/10/2016, 04:16 - Cindy LEUNG: Yes, I showered
15/10/2016, 04:16 - Mom: omg
15/10/2016, 04:16 - Mom: how can u have rest of ur brain?
15/10/2016, 04:16 - Mom: those toxin must be washed away during ur sleep time
15/10/2016, 04:17 - Cindy LEUNG: Look im reading the stuff on waste clearance in the brain.
15/10/2016, 04:17 - Cindy LEUNG: And I'm having a very bad feeling abt this.
15/10/2016, 04:17 - Mom: what bad feeling?
15/10/2016, 04:18 - Cindy LEUNG: The study was on clearance of beta amyloid
15/10/2016, 04:18 - Mom: yea, i know
15/10/2016, 04:18 - Cindy LEUNG: Which is a toxic protein which is associated with Alzheimer's right
15/10/2016, 04:18 - Mom: yea
15/10/2016, 04:18 - Mom: fear of having alzheimers
15/10/2016, 04:18 - Cindy LEUNG: So I started to look at Alzheimer's
15/10/2016, 04:19 - Mom: then?
15/10/2016, 04:19 - Cindy LEUNG: to see if there are similar symptoms
15/10/2016, 04:20 - Cindy LEUNG: to see if they get things like visual hallucinations and brain fog, cognitive problems, i.e. stuff that happened to me on thursday and friday
15/10/2016, 04:20 - Mom: don't try to frighten urself la
15/10/2016, 04:20 - Cindy LEUNG: sure enough, there are a lot of similar symptoms
15/10/2016, 04:21 - Cindy LEUNG: i think it's not necessary frighten
15/10/2016, 04:21 - Mom: ur brain is telling u to sleep trying to clear up all those toxin in ur brain
15/10/2016, 04:21 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz i have a real reason to actually worry.
15/10/2016, 04:21 - Cindy LEUNG: yea and what are those toxins
15/10/2016, 04:21 - Mom: dunno
15/10/2016, 04:21 - Cindy LEUNG: probably proteins
15/10/2016, 04:21 - Mom: the main prob is u can't sleep at night time
15/10/2016, 04:21 - Cindy LEUNG: yea i guess
15/10/2016, 04:21 - Mom: so u need to take nap during the day
15/10/2016, 04:21 - Cindy LEUNG: anyways
15/10/2016, 04:22 - Cindy LEUNG: no
15/10/2016, 04:22 - Cindy LEUNG: i think the lympathic system is linked to rem sleep
15/10/2016, 04:22 - Mom: see u only sleep for 2 - 4 hrs at night
15/10/2016, 04:22 - Cindy LEUNG: but they haven't progress to that point yet
15/10/2016, 04:22 - Mom: how can an ordinary person has enough sleep to do daily lives
15/10/2016, 04:23 - Mom: ur fear/ worries r totally reflected in ur dreams at night
15/10/2016, 04:23 - Cindy LEUNG: tell me how can i not worry.
15/10/2016, 04:24 - Cindy LEUNG: look, once u get alzheimer's u're a gonner
15/10/2016, 04:24 - Cindy LEUNG: u forget everything
15/10/2016, 04:24 - Cindy LEUNG: and lose sense of reality.
15/10/2016, 04:24 - Mom: sigh
15/10/2016, 04:24 - Cindy LEUNG: and pretty much anybody can get it
15/10/2016, 04:24 - Mom: this is the emotions happening in ur dreams
15/10/2016, 04:25 - Cindy LEUNG: can u just move on from the dreams for a sec
15/10/2016, 04:25 - Mom: live the day everyday as ur not having tmr
15/10/2016, 04:25 - Mom: then u wudn't bother too much
15/10/2016, 04:26 - Cindy LEUNG: let's just think hypothetically, that my waste clearance system has some sort of malfunction
15/10/2016, 04:26 - Mom: duuno
15/10/2016, 04:26 - Cindy LEUNG: then i think if u ignore the problem, it won't solve itself
15/10/2016, 04:26 - Mom: not to ignore it
15/10/2016, 04:27 - Cindy LEUNG: like if the toilet bowl is covered in shit, it won't suddenly all go away one day
15/10/2016, 04:27 - Mom: ur brain is actually working on it
15/10/2016, 04:27 - Cindy LEUNG: no i don't think so
15/10/2016, 04:27 - Mom: ur brain is active, not a passive thingy
15/10/2016, 04:27 - Cindy LEUNG: i think it is just 'coping'
15/10/2016, 04:28 - Cindy LEUNG: with some sort of malfunction
15/10/2016, 04:28 - Cindy LEUNG: obviously there's nothing wrong with the glial cells themselves
15/10/2016, 04:28 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz i can still clear stuff
15/10/2016, 04:28 - Cindy LEUNG: but those things are regulated by noradrenaline
15/10/2016, 04:29 - Mom: then?
15/10/2016, 04:29 - Cindy LEUNG: noradrenaline is something which came up before in my research
15/10/2016, 04:29 - Mom: and?
15/10/2016, 04:29 - Cindy LEUNG: basically it increases alertness
15/10/2016, 04:30 - Cindy LEUNG: would it be, i'm secreting too much of that stuff or at inappropiate times?
15/10/2016, 04:30 - Mom: at ur yr12??
15/10/2016, 04:31 - Cindy LEUNG: just i think rem sleep has something to do with noradrenaline
15/10/2016, 04:31 - Mom: how?
15/10/2016, 04:31 - Cindy LEUNG: now what they did in the experiment was use a noradrenaline blocker
15/10/2016, 04:32 - Cindy LEUNG: that put the mice to sleep and reduced beta amyloid by half
15/10/2016, 04:32 - Mom: yea, i read that research already
15/10/2016, 04:33 - Cindy LEUNG: now what if i took something like that
15/10/2016, 04:36 - Mom: took what?
15/10/2016, 04:36 - Cindy LEUNG: i'm looking at my notes, yea i started thinking about noradrenline (NE) when i looked at dopamine
15/10/2016, 04:38 - Cindy LEUNG: i've thought about the possibility of beta-blockers before
15/10/2016, 04:38 - Mom: https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/news/story/3956/to-sleep-perchance-to-clean.aspx
15/10/2016, 04:38 - Mom: this is the research abt the drainage system of ur brain
15/10/2016, 04:38 - Cindy LEUNG: but that stuff is use to lower heart rate. so i thought i was on the wrong track
15/10/2016, 04:39 - Cindy LEUNG: yea ok i read it
15/10/2016, 04:39 - Mom: no, that drainage system is independent of the body's lymphatic system
15/10/2016, 04:41 - Cindy LEUNG: i've been talking about the one in the brain all this time so far.... =.=
15/10/2016, 04:43 - Mom: üòû
15/10/2016, 04:47 - Cindy LEUNG: why i think its convincing is that i remember looking at rem atonia
15/10/2016, 04:47 - Cindy LEUNG: and NE levels was involved in that as well
15/10/2016, 04:48 - Cindy LEUNG: and it also seems to be related to functions in the heart as well
15/10/2016, 04:48 - Cindy LEUNG: plus its a 'stress' hormone
15/10/2016, 04:48 - Mom: ok
15/10/2016, 04:49 - Mom: review ur notes again to see if we can get any sound findings
15/10/2016, 04:50 - Cindy LEUNG: yea
15/10/2016, 04:50 - Cindy LEUNG: will be back
15/10/2016, 04:50 - Mom: k
15/10/2016, 09:00 - Mom: low blood sugar cuz u wake up in the mid-night
15/10/2016, 10:23 - Mom: Here‚Äôs something interesting for you‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ I have been off medications for 5 yrs now. I have N, cat, and sp. I took myself off meds when I became pregnant for my 2nd son. Could not handle the nodding attacks when meds where waring off. Cyber makes a very good point! I lost all cravings for sweets after my son was born! And now that I think about it, My sleep attacks and cat. episodes had reduced majorly! very controllable! SP (night terrors) had gone away. 5 yrs later‚Ä¶I am getting that craving back for sweets and I can tell the difference! N, C, and SP is back full force again!
15/10/2016, 10:23 - Mom: from this link http://www.talkaboutsleep.com/message-boards/topic/narcolepsy-and-low-blood-sugar-levels/
15/10/2016, 10:49 - Cindy LEUNG: so you think it's related to blood sugar levels?
15/10/2016, 10:49 - Cindy LEUNG: i am eating less food on average here
15/10/2016, 10:52 - Mom: i do think so
15/10/2016, 10:52 - Mom: rmb how u ate sugar at yr12?
15/10/2016, 10:52 - Mom: and then weird things happened
15/10/2016, 10:53 - Mom: next time when u wake up at 3am, eat a boiled egg to see if u can sleep better then
15/10/2016, 10:54 - Mom: also, u can't walk steadily every time after meal ??
15/10/2016, 10:54 - Mom: is this something related to blood sugar level??
15/10/2016, 10:54 - Cindy LEUNG: hmmm
15/10/2016, 10:54 - Cindy LEUNG: okay
15/10/2016, 10:55 - Cindy LEUNG: i get sleepy after eating food
15/10/2016, 10:55 - Mom: becos blood glucose level surge immediate after the meal
15/10/2016, 10:56 - Mom: and it seems ur body is lacking enough ??? to help balance ur BG level
15/10/2016, 10:56 - Mom: ??? = insulin ??? i dunno know
15/10/2016, 10:57 - Cindy LEUNG: hmmm possibly
15/10/2016, 10:57 - Cindy LEUNG: i told the doctor at nhs that i tend to sleep after meals
15/10/2016, 10:57 - Mom: how she respond?
15/10/2016, 10:58 - Cindy LEUNG: and then she said it was normal
15/10/2016, 10:58 - Cindy LEUNG: that people get tired after meals
15/10/2016, 10:58 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz ur gut uses more energy.
15/10/2016, 10:58 - Mom: becos BG level goes up
15/10/2016, 10:58 - Cindy LEUNG: so i thought she was going down the wrong path already
15/10/2016, 10:58 - Mom: that makes u sleepy
15/10/2016, 10:58 - Mom: not sure ah
15/10/2016, 10:59 - Mom: but can't eat too much starchy stuff
15/10/2016, 10:59 - Cindy LEUNG: its definitely not to do with energy
15/10/2016, 10:59 - Cindy LEUNG: there's something called postprandial
15/10/2016, 10:59 - Cindy LEUNG: hyperglycemia
15/10/2016, 11:00 - Mom: better buy a BG tester to test ur BG level especially at 3am
15/10/2016, 11:00 - Cindy LEUNG: ok
15/10/2016, 11:00 - Mom: to see if ur at LOW BG level
15/10/2016, 11:00 - Cindy LEUNG: i have been eating less carbs here that's for sure
15/10/2016, 11:00 - Mom: at that moment
15/10/2016, 11:00 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz i felt that the sleeping had something to do with eating too much carbs
15/10/2016, 11:01 - Mom: at the time u ate too much sugar, u might have alter the insulin level at ur body
15/10/2016, 11:01 - Mom: how abt napping after eating? feeling refresh?
15/10/2016, 11:02 - Cindy LEUNG: yes.

16/10/2016, 13:36 - Cindy LEUNG: And then he was like that's the million dollar question
16/10/2016, 13:37 - Mom: why?
16/10/2016, 13:37 - Mom: difficult question
16/10/2016, 13:37 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz if u know, then u can invest now
16/10/2016, 13:37 - Cindy LEUNG: Duh.

16/10/2016, 13:41 - Mom: what abt singapore office?
16/10/2016, 13:41 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz oriental people who actually speak English are a rarity in finance
16/10/2016, 13:42 - Cindy LEUNG: Dude have u not seen Singapore job market lately
16/10/2016, 13:42 - Mom: in fact, everywhere almost the same
16/10/2016, 13:42 - Mom: except us
16/10/2016, 13:42 - Cindy LEUNG: There's a job crisis there
16/10/2016, 13:42 - Mom: us's job market looks better
16/10/2016, 13:43 - Cindy LEUNG: Yah cuz us is mostly self contained
16/10/2016, 13:43 - Cindy LEUNG: IMO they don't really hv an immigration problem
16/10/2016, 13:43 - Mom: job crisis is everywhere cuz over-supply of graduates
16/10/2016, 13:43 - Mom: especially in china
16/10/2016, 13:43 - Cindy LEUNG: China ofc lah
16/10/2016, 13:44 - Cindy LEUNG: that's their problem
16/10/2016, 13:44 - Mom: no ah, this is the world prob
16/10/2016, 13:44 - Cindy LEUNG: a lot of them go overseas and get a foreign degree
16/10/2016, 13:44 - Mom: if china economy explodes, the world will be affected
16/10/2016, 13:44 - Cindy LEUNG: but then in all honesty, only degrees from top 100 unis are recognized
16/10/2016, 13:44 - Cindy LEUNG: yea ofc
16/10/2016, 13:45 - Mom: yesssss
16/10/2016, 13:45 - Cindy LEUNG: that's why i think china is unstable
16/10/2016, 13:45 - Cindy LEUNG: and most chinese students don't actually speak english well
16/10/2016, 13:45 - Mom: so ranking and popularity is crit
16/10/2016, 13:45 - Cindy LEUNG: so they're not gonna pass the four rounds of interviews
16/10/2016, 13:45 - Mom: crucial
16/10/2016, 13:46 - Cindy LEUNG: anyways, if u look at lse
16/10/2016, 13:46 - Mom: they pass the interviews through connection ma
16/10/2016, 13:46 - Cindy LEUNG: yea but foreign firm
16/10/2016, 13:46 - Cindy LEUNG: what sort of connections do they have?
16/10/2016, 13:46 - Cindy LEUNG: like they're not gonna get into merill lynch
16/10/2016, 13:46 - Mom: $$$$$
16/10/2016, 13:46 - Cindy LEUNG: even at the ubs careers event
16/10/2016, 13:46 - Cindy LEUNG: there weren't a lot of mainland ppl
16/10/2016, 13:46 - Cindy LEUNG: fluency in english is like bare min requiremnet
16/10/2016, 13:47 - Cindy LEUNG: and they don't value degrees like anf and management
16/10/2016, 13:47 - Cindy LEUNG: ib look for economics and quants
16/10/2016, 13:47 - Cindy LEUNG: sales they look for language  skills
16/10/2016, 13:47 - Mom: we can't say alot, but few mainlander wud/ can go into ib through connections including $$$$ and power
16/10/2016, 13:47 - Cindy LEUNG: yea they are a few
16/10/2016, 13:48 - Cindy LEUNG: like if their dad invest like half a bil capital
16/10/2016, 13:48 - Cindy LEUNG: but dude, the russians have that capital as well
16/10/2016, 13:48 - Cindy LEUNG: and they all speak english
16/10/2016, 13:48 - Cindy LEUNG: and russian
16/10/2016, 13:48 - Cindy LEUNG: and like a couple of other languages
16/10/2016, 13:48 - Mom: yea, ur right
16/10/2016, 13:48 - Cindy LEUNG: dude, its like
16/10/2016, 13:48 - Cindy LEUNG: how the fuck do u compete
16/10/2016, 13:49 - Mom: i was wondering why russians r not the centre of talk, but mainlander always were
16/10/2016, 13:50 - Cindy LEUNG: lol
16/10/2016, 13:50 - Cindy LEUNG: hahah that's quite true
16/10/2016, 13:50 - Cindy LEUNG: they are quiet sitting there
16/10/2016, 13:50 - Cindy LEUNG: but yea the russians are like pro
16/10/2016, 13:51 - Cindy LEUNG: there's this ukrainian girl who sat next to me in 225
16/10/2016, 13:51 - Cindy LEUNG: and she was filling out apps in class
16/10/2016, 13:51 - Mom: she's multi-tasking??
16/10/2016, 13:51 - Cindy LEUNG: no basically she didn't give a shit about 225
16/10/2016, 13:51 - Mom: haha
16/10/2016, 13:52 - Cindy LEUNG: though to be fair, 225 is quite easy
16/10/2016, 13:52 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz i did the game theory course
16/10/2016, 13:52 - Mom: sigh
16/10/2016, 13:52 - Cindy LEUNG: yeah so u see i started to realise that i have to take masters
16/10/2016, 13:53 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz i have no money or connection or language skills and i don't want a skills job
16/10/2016, 13:53 - Mom: ofc
16/10/2016, 13:53 - Cindy LEUNG: my only strategy is to gain skills right
16/10/2016, 13:53 - Mom: yea
16/10/2016, 13:53 - Cindy LEUNG: i mean sales job
16/10/2016, 13:54 - Mom: from now on, u have to acquire more skills like languages
16/10/2016, 13:54 - Cindy LEUNG: yea
16/10/2016, 13:54 - Cindy LEUNG: and focus on stats and computing
16/10/2016, 13:54 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz those are most valuable.
16/10/2016, 13:54 - Mom: exactly
16/10/2016, 13:54 - Cindy LEUNG: u see the indians have those skills
16/10/2016, 13:54 - Mom: so now u have very clear objective
16/10/2016, 13:55 - Cindy LEUNG: the indians are damn smart
16/10/2016, 13:55 - Cindy LEUNG: u know why
16/10/2016, 13:55 - Cindy LEUNG: i've figured out why
16/10/2016, 13:55 - Mom: sigh
16/10/2016, 13:55 - Mom: there're lots of smart guys out there
16/10/2016, 13:55 - Cindy LEUNG: its not that they are smart as individuals
16/10/2016, 13:55 - Cindy LEUNG: its that they have strong community
16/10/2016, 13:55 - Mom: u just have to do ur own good
16/10/2016, 13:56 - Cindy LEUNG: a team brainstorming will always beat a single person
16/10/2016, 13:56 - Mom: üòû
16/10/2016, 13:56 - Cindy LEUNG: i can prove that mathematically
16/10/2016, 13:56 - Cindy LEUNG: they have good culture
16/10/2016, 13:56 - Mom: üòû
16/10/2016, 13:56 - Cindy LEUNG: i think teh jews are like that too
16/10/2016, 13:56 - Mom: i think so
16/10/2016, 13:56 - Cindy LEUNG: chinese are like super reserved
16/10/2016, 13:56 - Mom: or jews r even smarter
16/10/2016, 13:57 - Cindy LEUNG: and they are actually not very smart, business-wise
16/10/2016, 13:57 - Cindy LEUNG: chinese people who make good researchers imo
16/10/2016, 13:57 - Cindy LEUNG: white people are too individual
16/10/2016, 13:57 - Cindy LEUNG: and they talk about random crap when they sit together
16/10/2016, 13:57 - Cindy LEUNG: there's no mentorship culture
16/10/2016, 13:57 - Mom: hmmm
16/10/2016, 13:58 - Mom: u mean whites?
16/10/2016, 13:58 - Mom: or chinese?
16/10/2016, 13:58 - Cindy LEUNG: white people have no mentorship culture
16/10/2016, 13:58 - Cindy LEUNG: well now chinese ppl don't either
16/10/2016, 13:58 - Cindy LEUNG: but they have stronger community imo
16/10/2016, 13:59 - Cindy LEUNG: japanese and korean have strength that their culture is based on mentorship so strong community
16/10/2016, 13:59 - Cindy LEUNG: indians have the most soft power cuz they look more like caucasians and they have strong community and math skills
16/10/2016, 14:00 - Mom: so ur conclusion: indians r the best??
16/10/2016, 14:00 - Mom: no way
16/10/2016, 14:00 - Cindy LEUNG: comparable difference is latin americans -- they have similar qualities, but they have poor work ethic
16/10/2016, 14:01 - Cindy LEUNG: like european work ethic
16/10/2016, 14:01 - Mom: ai ya, the most powerful Romans also vanished at the end of the day
16/10/2016, 14:01 - Cindy LEUNG: scandinavians have good education and natural privilege cuz they are white.
16/10/2016, 14:01 - Mom: u can't be perfect
16/10/2016, 14:02 - Cindy LEUNG: hmm the romans
16/10/2016, 14:02 - Cindy LEUNG: don't know enough about them
16/10/2016, 14:02 - Cindy LEUNG: but these are my golden nuggets of wisdom
16/10/2016, 14:03 - Cindy LEUNG: oh i forgot the americans
16/10/2016, 14:04 - Mom: i was thinking i u wud turn to be an archaeologist some days later
16/10/2016, 14:04 - Mom: *if
16/10/2016, 14:04 - Cindy LEUNG: americans have grit.
16/10/2016, 14:05 - Cindy LEUNG: that's all i can say
16/10/2016, 14:06 - Cindy LEUNG: they get no working holidays in a year, pay all that freaking tax and health insurance on top of that, live in quite shitty living conditions for an advanced industrial country and still think they're the best in the world
16/10/2016, 14:06 - Cindy LEUNG: i think that is some admirable quality.
16/10/2016, 14:06 - Mom: lolz
16/10/2016, 14:07 - Cindy LEUNG: it's like the guy who is not physically fit enough to run a marathon but still finishes it because he's stubborn and ends up in hospital afterwards.
16/10/2016, 14:08 - Mom: üòÇ
16/10/2016, 14:08 - Mom: ur observations and descriptions r so funny
16/10/2016, 14:09 - Cindy LEUNG: yah what is the lse for if not reenforcing more cultural stereotypes
16/10/2016, 14:11 - Mom: dunno get what u mean?

16/10/2016, 14:15 - Cindy LEUNG: i'm thinking of doing econ tutoring if i don't get an internship over the summer üòè
16/10/2016, 14:16 - Mom: yea, u can
16/10/2016, 14:16 - Cindy LEUNG: yes i definitely can
16/10/2016, 14:16 - Cindy LEUNG: i can derive the demand function.
16/10/2016, 14:16 - Cindy LEUNG: i definitely can
16/10/2016, 14:16 - Mom: lots of uni student do so in their summer vacation

16/10/2016, 14:16 - Cindy LEUNG: no comp
16/10/2016, 14:17 - Mom: becoz lse students mostly go to internship, i think
16/10/2016, 14:17 - Cindy LEUNG: ikr
16/10/2016, 14:17 - Mom: they don't bother to give tutorial lessons
16/10/2016, 14:20 - Cindy LEUNG: what else is she taking?
16/10/2016, 14:21 - Mom: other than econ, she doesn't care
16/10/2016, 14:21 - Cindy LEUNG: lol
16/10/2016, 14:21 - Cindy LEUNG: don't take math studies.
16/10/2016, 14:21 - Cindy LEUNG: and its not good to be overly fascinated with one subject.
16/10/2016, 14:21 - Mom: ofc not la
16/10/2016, 14:21 - Mom: like film studies?
16/10/2016, 14:21 - Cindy LEUNG: or history
16/10/2016, 14:21 - Cindy LEUNG: i would say econ ee is quite easy though
16/10/2016, 14:21 - Mom: she def won't
16/10/2016, 14:22 - Mom: maybe chem and bio
16/10/2016, 14:22 - Cindy LEUNG: hmm
16/10/2016, 14:22 - Cindy LEUNG: standard math
16/10/2016, 14:22 - Mom: if she can manage maths well, it's better to do hl maths
16/10/2016, 14:22 - Cindy LEUNG: yeah its definitely better to do hl maths
16/10/2016, 14:22 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz its not that hard.
16/10/2016, 14:23 - Mom: u need a 6 the min
16/10/2016, 14:23 - Mom: otherwise no good wow
16/10/2016, 14:23 - Cindy LEUNG: yah, i knew of people who were in set 3 and set 2 and they struggled
16/10/2016, 14:24 - Cindy LEUNG: i would also say business studies is a complete waste of time
16/10/2016, 14:24 - Mom: i won't recommend these subject
16/10/2016, 14:24 - Mom: u know i'm practical
16/10/2016, 14:25 - Cindy LEUNG: physics was good
16/10/2016, 14:25 - Mom: and she doesn't reject my recommendation
16/10/2016, 14:25 - Cindy LEUNG: ok great
16/10/2016, 14:25 - Mom: phys, chem, maths and econ
16/10/2016, 14:25 - Mom: u can just pick 3
16/10/2016, 14:26 - Mom: and she's not going into engrg, so i think physics isn't a must
16/10/2016, 14:26 - Mom: so i was thinking econ, chem and bio/ mahts
16/10/2016, 14:26 - Cindy LEUNG: imo i think physics goes well with chem
16/10/2016, 14:27 - Mom: shudn't physics be paired with maths??
16/10/2016, 14:27 - Cindy LEUNG: hmmm... ib physics is sort of dumbed down
16/10/2016, 14:27 - Cindy LEUNG: so u don't actually need math
16/10/2016, 14:27 - Cindy LEUNG: same for econ
16/10/2016, 14:27 - Mom: idk
16/10/2016, 14:27 - Cindy LEUNG: all u need is algebra
16/10/2016, 14:27 - Cindy LEUNG: it's kind of stupid
16/10/2016, 14:28 - Cindy LEUNG: yea i think chem is better
16/10/2016, 14:28 - Mom: but physics and maths r engrg subjects
16/10/2016, 14:28 - Cindy LEUNG: even northwestern thinks chem is fundamental subject
16/10/2016, 14:28 - Mom: yea
16/10/2016, 14:28 - Mom: chem is unique
16/10/2016, 14:28 - Cindy LEUNG: just do what northwestern thinks is right.
16/10/2016, 14:28 - Cindy LEUNG: won't go wrong with that
16/10/2016, 14:28 - Mom: so my thought is econ, chem + ???
16/10/2016, 14:28 - Cindy LEUNG: math
16/10/2016, 14:28 - Cindy LEUNG: hahaha
16/10/2016, 14:29 - Cindy LEUNG: that should keep u busy.
16/10/2016, 14:29 - Mom: ur loving nu
16/10/2016, 14:29 - Cindy LEUNG: well they are a good school
16/10/2016, 14:29 - Cindy LEUNG: just couldn't afford it
16/10/2016, 14:29 - Mom: we can but just the first deg
16/10/2016, 14:30 - Cindy LEUNG: well based on my analysis just now, first degree is definitely not enough
16/10/2016, 14:30 - Mom: exactly especially these days
16/10/2016, 14:30 - Cindy LEUNG: if u stop after first degree its like u waste all that investment
16/10/2016, 14:30 - Mom: masters is a min and phd is better
16/10/2016, 14:30 - Cindy LEUNG: yea
16/10/2016, 14:30 - Mom: if u just do a first deg, ur going to be an unskilled labor
16/10/2016, 14:31 - Cindy LEUNG: or a liberal arts degree
16/10/2016, 14:31 - Cindy LEUNG: liberal arts degree is really sunk cost
16/10/2016, 14:31 - Cindy LEUNG: and it downgrades the master as well imo, cuz u can't do any advanced stuff
16/10/2016, 14:31 - Mom: that's why i didn't want to spend too much money in just the first deg
16/10/2016, 14:31 - Cindy LEUNG: yea that is good foresight
16/10/2016, 14:31 - Mom: sigh, liberal arts degree ...
16/10/2016, 14:32 - Mom: education inflation
16/10/2016, 14:32 - Mom: or govt just want to push ppl back to college to keep the unemployment rate down
16/10/2016, 14:32 - Mom: this is a world prob
16/10/2016, 14:33 - Cindy LEUNG: hmm i get what u mean
16/10/2016, 14:33 - Mom: to some extent, i wud rather think not even get a first deg might be a wise choice
16/10/2016, 14:33 - Mom: u just start from the ground work
16/10/2016, 14:34 - Cindy LEUNG: yea
16/10/2016, 14:34 - Cindy LEUNG: it's like u don't learn anything valuable in undergrad
16/10/2016, 14:34 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz u can't
16/10/2016, 14:34 - Mom: at least u have all ur savings from the very start of ur career yr
16/10/2016, 14:35 - Mom: tbh, first deg is just like secondary education in the old days
16/10/2016, 14:35 - Cindy LEUNG: kind of lah
16/10/2016, 14:36 - Cindy LEUNG: well u don't actually do much in undergrad
16/10/2016, 14:36 - Cindy LEUNG: unless u take a quant
16/10/2016, 14:36 - Mom: yea
16/10/2016, 14:36 - Mom: esp for those taking liberal arts subjects, just waste of time
16/10/2016, 14:36 - Cindy LEUNG: and then if u don't continue with first degree then there wasn't really a point in studying all the history/ philosophy/ whatever
16/10/2016, 14:39 - Cindy LEUNG: but then hey
16/10/2016, 14:39 - Cindy LEUNG: no company will employ an 18 year old
16/10/2016, 14:39 - Cindy LEUNG: esp not for business
16/10/2016, 14:40 - Cindy LEUNG: so what are you gonna do for those 3 years after high school
16/10/2016, 14:40 - Mom: when u leave high school, ur 17 yrs old la
16/10/2016, 14:40 - Cindy LEUNG: i guess that's why the americans make undergrad like extended summer camp
16/10/2016, 14:41 - Mom: u can be an apprentice
16/10/2016, 14:41 - Mom: wow, u need a lot of money to go to that "summer camp"
16/10/2016, 14:41 - Cindy LEUNG: summer camps are expensive dude
16/10/2016, 14:42 - Cindy LEUNG: its a million dollar business
16/10/2016, 14:44 - Mom: but even americans can't afford that expensive summer camp
16/10/2016, 14:44 - Cindy LEUNG: the average american has very little  savings
16/10/2016, 14:45 - Mom: how wud they have savings on top of those taxes and health insurance
16/10/2016, 14:46 - Cindy LEUNG: they also have this thing called a 401k
16/10/2016, 14:46 - Mom: oh yea
16/10/2016, 14:46 - Cindy LEUNG: the government forces u to save for retirement
16/10/2016, 14:46 - Mom: the mandatory pfund
16/10/2016, 14:46 - Cindy LEUNG: so yea they're never gonna pay that deb
16/10/2016, 14:47 - Mom: 401k is not debt
16/10/2016, 14:48 - Cindy LEUNG: i meant school debt
16/10/2016, 14:48 - Mom: some ppl can if u borrow less in college
16/10/2016, 14:48 - Mom: and earn more like if ur lawyer or doc, u can repay all ur debts, i think
16/10/2016, 14:49 - Cindy LEUNG: those degrees cost more though
16/10/2016, 14:49 - Mom: ofc la

17/10/2016, 17:06 - Cindy LEUNG: They send invites after screening cv
17/10/2016, 17:07 - Cindy LEUNG: anyways and I didn't get the language bursary
17/10/2016, 17:07 - Mom: so u didn't get that invites for the career event rite?
17/10/2016, 17:07 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea
17/10/2016, 17:07 - Mom: what reason u ask for language bursary?
17/10/2016, 17:08 - Mom: personal interest or career development?
17/10/2016, 17:09 - Cindy LEUNG: Personal development
17/10/2016, 17:09 - Cindy LEUNG: Whatever in retrospect I should hv wrote it differently
17/10/2016, 17:09 - Mom: how much is the bursary?
17/10/2016, 17:09 - Cindy LEUNG: But Nevermind

17/10/2016, 17:10 - Cindy LEUNG: No ¬£120
17/10/2016, 17:10 - Mom: so u can't go to those career events anymore?
17/10/2016, 17:11 - Mom: just 120 pounds, not a big deal
17/10/2016, 17:11 - Mom: can u take that language without bursary?
17/10/2016, 17:13 - Mom: take shower, ttyl
17/10/2016, 18:01 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea but the key thing is
17/10/2016, 18:01 - Cindy LEUNG: That guy won't reply to my fucking email
17/10/2016, 18:01 - Mom: stats guy?
17/10/2016, 18:01 - Cindy LEUNG: I get nervous abt no response
17/10/2016, 18:01 - Mom: sigh

17/10/2016, 18:02 - Cindy LEUNG: I sent Monday morning
17/10/2016, 18:02 - Cindy LEUNG: Dude it's within working hrs
17/10/2016, 18:02 - Mom: just several hrs?
17/10/2016, 18:02 - Cindy LEUNG: Its been a whole day
17/10/2016, 18:03 - Mom: yea, but do they have any policy to reply an email by a definite hrs or days?
17/10/2016, 18:03 - Mom: u want to drop finance and switch to stats?
17/10/2016, 18:04 - Mom: why not just take additional 1/2 credits in lent term?
17/10/2016, 18:04 - Cindy LEUNG: Hmm I wanna do that too
17/10/2016, 18:04 - Cindy LEUNG: But then I'm not sure they'll let me
17/10/2016, 18:04 - Cindy LEUNG: ....
17/10/2016, 18:04 - Mom: did u ask ur advisor abt this?
17/10/2016, 18:04 - Cindy LEUNG: My advisor is from finland
17/10/2016, 18:04 - Mom: u need to ask ur advisor in the meant time
17/10/2016, 18:05 - Mom: send him an email
17/10/2016, 18:05 - Cindy LEUNG: I think I'll talk to dept tutor
17/10/2016, 18:05 - Cindy LEUNG: I'll email dept tutor tonight, ask him if I can take additional unit
17/10/2016, 18:05 - Mom: u have passed the deadline for changing subject and it wud be quite difficult if the new dept allows u a change
17/10/2016, 18:06 - Cindy LEUNG: Hmm lots of people switch after deadline though
17/10/2016, 18:06 - Mom: u shud ask dept tutor if taking additional 1/2 credit is possible cuz it's been late for changing subj and the stats dept didn't even reply to ur email
17/10/2016, 18:07 - Mom: do both simultaneouly
17/10/2016, 18:07 - Mom: to see which one grant u approval
17/10/2016, 18:08 - Mom: if stats dept didn't reply by tmr morning, send them a second request
17/10/2016, 18:09 - Cindy LEUNG: Ok
17/10/2016, 18:10 - Mom: and abt ur career events, there're always quota
17/10/2016, 18:11 - Mom: u might have just send in reservation too late and that event has been oversubscribed
17/10/2016, 18:11 - Mom: don't panic la
17/10/2016, 18:11 - Mom: just apply for other event earlier
17/10/2016, 18:11 - Mom: don't wait until deadline
17/10/2016, 18:13 - Mom: and u can always send them following emails asking if u can standby those events to show them ur passion for their activities and companies
17/10/2016, 18:20 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea I guess
17/10/2016, 18:20 - Cindy LEUNG: Sure
17/10/2016, 18:20 - Cindy LEUNG: Just

17/10/2016, 18:27 - Mom: like dept head or some other person

17/10/2016, 18:51 - Cindy LEUNG: No

20/10/2016, 05:18 - Cindy LEUNG: I thought I woke up and saw this headless lady in black typing on a smartphone
20/10/2016, 05:18 - Cindy LEUNG: And then she was like, I'm called a psychologist
20/10/2016, 05:19 - Cindy LEUNG: I look after Ur sleep
20/10/2016, 05:20 - Cindy LEUNG: And then I don't remember very well but then we start talking abt my sleep prob
20/10/2016, 05:20 - Cindy LEUNG: Once she starts talking to me she has a head btw
20/10/2016, 05:21 - Cindy LEUNG: To get sleep I had to a series of unrelated tasks
20/10/2016, 05:21 - Cindy LEUNG: To do
20/10/2016, 05:22 - Cindy LEUNG: And then once I completed them
20/10/2016, 05:22 - Cindy LEUNG: Oh
20/10/2016, 05:22 - Cindy LEUNG: She placed this pillow on my face
20/10/2016, 05:23 - Cindy LEUNG: And it didn't work cuz she said I couldn't close my eyes
20/10/2016, 05:23 - Cindy LEUNG: As in I can't close them
20/10/2016, 05:23 - Cindy LEUNG: And then so I still couldn't sleep
20/10/2016, 05:24 - Cindy LEUNG: a different person came to check my liver
20/10/2016, 05:24 - Cindy LEUNG: And then she seemed nice and all
20/10/2016, 05:25 - Cindy LEUNG: But then while she was talking to me, there was this Chinese style shrine behind her
20/10/2016, 05:26 - Cindy LEUNG: And I kept hearing a metal gate rattling sound , like something trying to escape from inside
20/10/2016, 05:27 - Mom: and then?
20/10/2016, 05:27 - Cindy LEUNG: I thought it was dodgy, and maybe a signal that the person who came to check my liver was not a good thing
20/10/2016, 05:27 - Cindy LEUNG: So I tried to wake up for real since this is still a dream
20/10/2016, 05:28 - Mom: did she saying anything abt ur liver?

20/10/2016, 05:29 - Mom: yea, if ur liver underperform u can't sleep well
20/10/2016, 05:29 - Cindy LEUNG: Just before I woke, I thought I had a charm poster on the wall and that had burnt really quickly

20/10/2016, 05:29 - Mom: ???

20/10/2016, 05:29 - Mom: weird stuff
20/10/2016, 05:30 - Cindy LEUNG: Like I thought a poster had burnt off the wall cuz of bad demons around or something like that
20/10/2016, 05:30 - Mom: did u have ur charm still hanging on ur neck?
20/10/2016, 05:31 - Cindy LEUNG: No

20/10/2016, 05:33 - Mom: ok

20/10/2016, 05:34 - Mom: yellowish or white
20/10/2016, 05:34 - Cindy LEUNG: Dunno I can't tell
20/10/2016, 05:34 - Cindy LEUNG: But
20/10/2016, 05:35 - Cindy LEUNG: Before dinner
20/10/2016, 05:35 - Cindy LEUNG: I fell asleep in the chair
20/10/2016, 05:35 - Cindy LEUNG: And then I had the thing where my muscles keep twitching
20/10/2016, 05:35 - Cindy LEUNG: And I went into rem
20/10/2016, 05:36 - Cindy LEUNG: And then I remember them saying I suddenly look brighter after the twitching stopped
20/10/2016, 05:37 - Mom: who's them?
20/10/2016, 05:37 - Cindy LEUNG: But that was in a dream
20/10/2016, 05:37 - Cindy LEUNG: Like random people? I thought they were my friends
20/10/2016, 05:37 - Cindy LEUNG: But I didn't know their name.
20/10/2016, 05:37 - Cindy LEUNG: Or recognize face
20/10/2016, 05:37 - Mom: not ur flatmates?
20/10/2016, 05:37 - Cindy LEUNG: No
20/10/2016, 05:37 - Cindy LEUNG: Its a dream
20/10/2016, 05:37 - Mom: ic
20/10/2016, 05:38 - Mom: this is also weird?
20/10/2016, 05:38 - Mom: watch ur face colour for indication abt ur liver condition
20/10/2016, 05:38 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea I always do
20/10/2016, 05:39 - Cindy LEUNG: But yeaaa
20/10/2016, 05:39 - Mom: i guess, ur liver enzyme is causing u that tired
20/10/2016, 05:39 - Cindy LEUNG: Why
20/10/2016, 05:39 - Mom: this is medical
20/10/2016, 05:39 - Cindy LEUNG: Should I take enzymes then
20/10/2016, 05:40 - Cindy LEUNG: I haven't been eating much tbh
20/10/2016, 05:40 - Mom: liver enzyme insufficient makes u unable to clear toxin in ur body
20/10/2016, 05:40 - Mom: and ur face then turn yellow
20/10/2016, 05:40 - Cindy LEUNG: My face isn't really yellow
20/10/2016, 05:41 - Mom: but i'm not sure which one enzyme is rlly good, and i don't want u to risk of getting even worse cuz if u took the wrong enzyme, ur liver is going to be even worse than before
20/10/2016, 05:41 - Cindy LEUNG: But that was the longest I probably ever slept
20/10/2016, 05:41 - Cindy LEUNG: I see
20/10/2016, 05:42 - Mom: do u eat enough protein and veggie for ur body to have enough energy??
20/10/2016, 05:42 - Mom: how long?
20/10/2016, 05:42 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea
20/10/2016, 05:42 - Cindy LEUNG: Like maybe went to bed before 11?
20/10/2016, 05:43 - Mom: i think u can try add small amout of carb in ur diet to see if u can get more energy
20/10/2016, 05:43 - Mom: so that's a total of 5 or 6 hrs sleep?
20/10/2016, 05:43 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea
20/10/2016, 05:44 - Mom: ok
20/10/2016, 05:44 - Mom: have u tried eating some snack when u woke up in the midnight? and then u can go back to sleep faster and better?
20/10/2016, 05:45 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea I tried that yesterday
20/10/2016, 05:45 - Cindy LEUNG: No improvement
20/10/2016, 05:45 - Mom: one time only?
20/10/2016, 05:45 - Cindy LEUNG: I felt it took longer to go back to sleep
20/10/2016, 05:46 - Mom: what did u eat?
20/10/2016, 05:46 - Cindy LEUNG: Like a wrap
20/10/2016, 05:46 - Cindy LEUNG: Leftovers
20/10/2016, 05:46 - Mom: what is the food of those leftovers?
20/10/2016, 05:48 - Mom: u shud eat something like boiled or scambled eggs which gives u protein and increase ur blood glucose level gradually
20/10/2016, 05:49 - Mom: ppl used to eat sweet stuff like ice-cream in the mid-night and rlly go to bed faster and then they'll have bad dream afterwards
20/10/2016, 05:49 - Mom: cuz that's a spike in the blood glucose level
20/10/2016, 05:49 - Cindy LEUNG: They don't hv eggs at cooo
20/10/2016, 05:50 - Cindy LEUNG: Coop
20/10/2016, 05:50 - Mom: just keep some in ur place
20/10/2016, 05:50 - Mom: don't have fridge?
20/10/2016, 05:50 - Cindy LEUNG: I gotta walk all the way to reach to get six eggs
20/10/2016, 05:50 - Mom: food wud be stolen by others?
20/10/2016, 05:50 - Cindy LEUNG: Tesco
20/10/2016, 05:51 - Mom: when u passby, get them
20/10/2016, 05:51 - Cindy LEUNG: No coop doesn't stock eggs.
20/10/2016, 05:51 - Cindy LEUNG: I am carrying 10 books
20/10/2016, 05:51 - Mom: nvm la, just find some other methods to keep u sleep longer
20/10/2016, 05:52 - Cindy LEUNG: I dunno
20/10/2016, 05:52 - Mom: i think this is the best way to get enough rest
20/10/2016, 05:52 - Cindy LEUNG: Out of ifeas
20/10/2016, 05:52 - Mom: sigh
20/10/2016, 05:52 - Mom: becos ur 2/3 hrs sleep rlly hurts ur internal organs
20/10/2016, 05:53 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea firgures
20/10/2016, 05:53 - Mom: don't worry la, those're just dream
20/10/2016, 05:53 - Mom: take it easy
20/10/2016, 05:54 - Mom: they'll go some days
20/10/2016, 05:54 - Cindy LEUNG: Reading also takes a lot of toil
20/10/2016, 05:55 - Mom: yea
20/10/2016, 05:55 - Cindy LEUNG: It must be one of the most laborous processes in the brain
20/10/2016, 05:55 - Cindy LEUNG: No wonder people who read r smart
20/10/2016, 05:56 - Cindy LEUNG: And then same for math and logic related processes
20/10/2016, 05:56 - Mom: That's why scholars used to have white hair
20/10/2016, 05:57 - Cindy LEUNG: I think they r just heavy load cognitive processes so my brain burns out quickly and I see stuff change colour
20/10/2016, 05:57 - Mom: Always change colour?
20/10/2016, 05:57 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea if I'm tired
20/10/2016, 05:58 - Cindy LEUNG: Like the page becomes more yellow
20/10/2016, 05:58 - Mom: Not green?
20/10/2016, 05:58 - Cindy LEUNG: And the text gets like a green aura
20/10/2016, 05:59 - Mom: U shud take a rest then
20/10/2016, 05:59 - Cindy LEUNG: When it actually flashes green I'm really tired
20/10/2016, 05:59 - Mom: Get rest and take care
20/10/2016, 06:00 - Cindy LEUNG: Struggling with time management
20/10/2016, 06:01 - Cindy LEUNG: There's not a lot to read, but I'm half as efficient so now there is
20/10/2016, 06:01 - Cindy LEUNG: And I can't do the pset without reading the chp
20/10/2016, 06:02 - Mom: No way

21/10/2016, 04:58 - Mom: ur stressed, this is real
21/10/2016, 04:58 - Mom: and fact
21/10/2016, 04:58 - Mom: and that caused u anxious, which is also fact
21/10/2016, 04:59 - Cindy LEUNG: No
21/10/2016, 04:59 - Mom: that's why ur dreams r full of being attacked
21/10/2016, 04:59 - Cindy LEUNG: I hv anxiety
21/10/2016, 04:59 - Cindy LEUNG: And that causes stress
21/10/2016, 04:59 - Cindy LEUNG: Its not the other way round
21/10/2016, 05:00 - Mom: i can say "stress" and "anxiety" r just a vicious cycle
21/10/2016, 05:00 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz it just doesn't feel like normal shit
21/10/2016, 05:01 - Cindy LEUNG: Like u can tell the difference between someone who's upset and someone who has clinical depression
21/10/2016, 05:01 - Mom: ur stress comes from yr12 heavy workload and the following mysterious sleep disorders
21/10/2016, 05:01 - Cindy LEUNG: They r both stressed but not the same
21/10/2016, 05:01 - Mom: this cause u anxiety abt ur ability to cope with future
21/10/2016, 05:02 - Cindy LEUNG: ....
21/10/2016, 05:02 - Cindy LEUNG: No
21/10/2016, 05:02 - Cindy LEUNG: I'm using the word anxiety medically
21/10/2016, 05:02 - Cindy LEUNG: I have fucking tingling nerves
21/10/2016, 05:03 - Cindy LEUNG: Racing heart
21/10/2016, 05:03 - Cindy LEUNG: Uncontrollable emotions
21/10/2016, 05:03 - Cindy LEUNG: Etc.
21/10/2016, 05:03 - Cindy LEUNG: Like u make it sound like I'm just worried abt stuff
21/10/2016, 05:03 - Mom: those r the effect of ur fight and flight response??
21/10/2016, 05:03 - Cindy LEUNG: Yes
21/10/2016, 05:04 - Cindy LEUNG: I think so
21/10/2016, 05:04 - Cindy LEUNG: My hpa axis is kinda off
21/10/2016, 05:04 - Mom: what i called "anxiety" is kind of ur physical adrenal effects
21/10/2016, 05:05 - Cindy LEUNG: Like what I'm saying is, even if I had no stress, I would still hv symptoms of anxiety
21/10/2016, 05:05 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea that's what I mean
21/10/2016, 05:05 - Cindy LEUNG: Not just scared or worried
21/10/2016, 05:05 - Mom: u wont be having no stress, cuz ur condition now is extremely stressful
21/10/2016, 05:06 - Mom: i don't mean normal scared or worried
21/10/2016, 05:06 - Cindy LEUNG: Well yah ofc the stress load just aggravates it
21/10/2016, 05:06 - Cindy LEUNG: But the initial system seems out if balance to me
21/10/2016, 05:07 - Cindy LEUNG: I'm literally getting sick all the time like Anson
21/10/2016, 05:08 - Mom: who's anson?
21/10/2016, 05:08 - Cindy LEUNG: My friend from hs
21/10/2016, 05:08 - Mom: the one u met in starbucks?
21/10/2016, 05:08 - Mom: so u think u need to see psychiatrist?
21/10/2016, 05:08 - Cindy LEUNG: She had mild anxiety, u could tell
21/10/2016, 05:08 - Cindy LEUNG: They just gave her concerta
21/10/2016, 05:08 - Cindy LEUNG: Which is ritalin
21/10/2016, 05:08 - Mom: does it work?
21/10/2016, 05:09 - Mom: for her?
21/10/2016, 05:09 - Cindy LEUNG: She said she felt more focused
21/10/2016, 05:09 - Cindy LEUNG: But I'm not sure, she didn't even take it regularly
21/10/2016, 05:09 - Cindy LEUNG: So probably not
21/10/2016, 05:10 - Cindy LEUNG: Maybe I should talk to someone
21/10/2016, 05:10 - Mom: have u tried to talk to urself?
21/10/2016, 05:10 - Cindy LEUNG: At least someone knows what happened
21/10/2016, 05:11 - Cindy LEUNG: üòëüòëüòë
21/10/2016, 05:11 - Cindy LEUNG: If that worked I wouldn't hv a problem?
21/10/2016, 05:11 - Cindy LEUNG: The whole point is I'm too unstable to deal with it
21/10/2016, 05:12 - Mom: sorry, what do u expect someone to talk to do with ur anxiety?
21/10/2016, 05:12 - Cindy LEUNG: I kind of need a person to tell me what to do right now.
21/10/2016, 05:12 - Mom: she offers help? or medication?
21/10/2016, 05:12 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea I don't like it when people ask me that question
21/10/2016, 05:12 - Mom: what if nhs tell u to do exercise?
21/10/2016, 05:12 - Cindy LEUNG: I already do
21/10/2016, 05:13 - Cindy LEUNG: Its not helping obviously
21/10/2016, 05:13 - Mom: u must have a plan abt ur expectation of help from others?
21/10/2016, 05:13 - Mom: this is not challenging ur emotions
21/10/2016, 05:13 - Cindy LEUNG: U don't ask a depressed person to hv expectations
21/10/2016, 05:13 - Mom: even if u go to psychiatrist, he/she wud also pose that question
21/10/2016, 05:14 - Cindy LEUNG: That's like telling them to go kill themself
21/10/2016, 05:14 - Mom: the point is they have to identify prob and suitable mesures to help u
21/10/2016, 05:15 - Cindy LEUNG: That's their job not mine
21/10/2016, 05:15 - Cindy LEUNG: I can't even think rationally at this moment and u ask me what u should do
21/10/2016, 05:16 - Mom: not "what u shud" but what u think i shud do to help u?
21/10/2016, 05:16 - Cindy LEUNG: Exactly that's the same question
21/10/2016, 05:16 - Mom: okok
21/10/2016, 05:17 - Mom: sorry
21/10/2016, 05:17 - Cindy LEUNG: I wanna puke
21/10/2016, 05:17 - Mom: do it
21/10/2016, 05:18 - Cindy LEUNG: I can't
21/10/2016, 05:18 - Mom: i guess it's just a feeling of "puke",  not exactly a physical reaction
21/10/2016, 05:18 - Cindy LEUNG: Its nausea
21/10/2016, 05:18 - Mom: cuz ur nervous and feel angry atm

21/10/2016, 09:07 - Cindy LEUNG: I'm not good on Friday mornings in gen
21/10/2016, 09:07 - Mom: I know
21/10/2016, 09:08 - Cindy LEUNG: And I get upset when my sleeping disorder interrupts my school work
21/10/2016, 09:08 - Mom: Ofc
21/10/2016, 09:08 - Cindy LEUNG: And then it'll be like typhoon no.8 for the whole day and I can't do anything productive
21/10/2016, 09:08 - Mom: Everyone will br same under severe sleep deprivation
21/10/2016, 09:09 - Mom: Ok la
21/10/2016, 09:09 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea but I need a doctors note
21/10/2016, 09:09 - Mom: Talk to ur dept head
21/10/2016, 09:09 - Cindy LEUNG: I need to fill in form online
21/10/2016, 09:09 - Cindy LEUNG: And I need a doctors note.
21/10/2016, 09:10 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz admin approves it
21/10/2016, 09:10 - Mom: Cant u just talk to dept head or totor first to see if private arrangement can be made
21/10/2016, 09:10 - Mom: Cuz this is faster
21/10/2016, 09:10 - Cindy LEUNG: No
21/10/2016, 09:11 - Cindy LEUNG: Its very bureaucratic
21/10/2016, 09:11 - Cindy LEUNG: Even the dept head had to fill out the form
21/10/2016, 09:11 - Mom: if u go to nhs, how possible they issue u a medical cert
21/10/2016, 09:11 - Mom: this is one prob
21/10/2016, 09:12 - Cindy LEUNG: Hmm migraine?
21/10/2016, 09:12 - Cindy LEUNG: I hv migraine def
21/10/2016, 09:12 - Mom: what if nhs doc doesn't recognise ur symptoms??
21/10/2016, 09:12 - Cindy LEUNG: Well it's walk in today, so I'll go to that
21/10/2016, 09:12 - Mom: is migraine strong enough for such a change of time schedule
21/10/2016, 09:12 - Mom: but anyway, u can try
21/10/2016, 09:13 - Cindy LEUNG: She didn't even record down my symptoms last time when I told her I cant sleep
21/10/2016, 09:13 - Mom: this is the point
21/10/2016, 09:13 - Cindy LEUNG: Now we know NHS attitude towards sleep problems
21/10/2016, 09:14 - Mom: so when u walk in this time, just tell her u need a medical cert to arrange time schedule, otherwise u can't continue ur studies??
21/10/2016, 09:14 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea ok
21/10/2016, 09:14 - Mom: doc normally won't treat sleep prob seriously
21/10/2016, 09:15 - Mom: in the meantime, u can try ask ur tutor/ dept head to see if alternative arrangement is possible
21/10/2016, 09:46 - Cindy LEUNG: So PayPal just called me like a billion times
21/10/2016, 09:46 - Cindy LEUNG: And i managed to pay with the same card that they won't fucking let me add in

21/10/2016, 10:24 - Mom: that might relate to ur eye pressure

21/10/2016, 10:25 - Cindy LEUNG: I would only take benzos during bad anxiety attack
21/10/2016, 10:25 - Mom: maybe benzo helps u temporarily release ur pressure
21/10/2016, 10:25 - Mom: i mean muscles pressure

21/10/2016, 10:26 - Mom: benzo is also a muscle relaxant
21/10/2016, 10:26 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz I'm worried.
21/10/2016, 10:26 - Mom: voluntary nap or involuntary??
21/10/2016, 10:26 - Cindy LEUNG: Voluntary
21/10/2016, 10:27 - Cindy LEUNG: Only sometimes invol

21/10/2016, 18:46 - Cindy LEUNG: I'm like, this is why kgv kids can't get into lse
22/10/2016, 02:43 - Mom: Haha
23/10/2016, 02:19 - Cindy LEUNG: Hi
23/10/2016, 02:20 - Cindy LEUNG: Dude I need some advice.
23/10/2016, 02:20 - Cindy LEUNG: I think this charity thing im involved in is really dodgy
23/10/2016, 02:21 - Mom: Whst charity?
23/10/2016, 02:21 - Cindy LEUNG: Enactus
23/10/2016, 02:22 - Cindy LEUNG: Basically they help poor people set up businesses to finance themselves out of poverty
23/10/2016, 02:22 - Cindy LEUNG: Aka microfinance
23/10/2016, 02:22 - Mom: How do they help?
23/10/2016, 02:23 - Cindy LEUNG: By injecting capital and imposing a business plan on them
23/10/2016, 02:23 - Mom: Where money comes from in the beginning
23/10/2016, 02:24 - Cindy LEUNG: Dude fundraising
23/10/2016, 02:24 - Cindy LEUNG: Its totally not enough already
23/10/2016, 02:24 - Mom: So u guys do fundraising thingy?
23/10/2016, 02:25 - Cindy LEUNG: Actually at this point I'm not so sure what they're doing.
23/10/2016, 02:25 - Mom: Why?
23/10/2016, 02:25 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz the project encountered "difficulties" over the summer
23/10/2016, 02:26 - Cindy LEUNG: I.e. it botched
23/10/2016, 02:27 - Cindy LEUNG: And then the ppl they were working with went AWOL
23/10/2016, 02:27 - Cindy LEUNG: Not to mention they had a language barrier in the first place
23/10/2016, 02:28 - Cindy LEUNG: And the whole thing seems as dodgy as teaching country people english
23/10/2016, 02:28 - Mom: sorry, what do u mean "difficulties"
23/10/2016, 02:28 - Mom: and what languages barrier they have?
23/10/2016, 02:29 - Mom: is that organisation a properly registered charity?
23/10/2016, 02:29 - Mom: is there full-time paid staff there?
23/10/2016, 02:29 - Cindy LEUNG: Ok so basically they try to empower ex street kids by teaching them business skills
23/10/2016, 02:29 - Cindy LEUNG: Its lse society
23/10/2016, 02:30 - Mom: so ppl there r lse students, rite?
23/10/2016, 02:30 - Cindy LEUNG: Its sort of like a global student organization
23/10/2016, 02:30 - Mom: no full-time staff?
23/10/2016, 02:30 - Cindy LEUNG: No
23/10/2016, 02:30 - Mom: ok
23/10/2016, 02:30 - Cindy LEUNG: Its dodgy as hell
23/10/2016, 02:30 - Mom: so how dodgy it is?
23/10/2016, 02:30 - Cindy LEUNG: U got these clueless fresher's sitting around
23/10/2016, 02:31 - Mom: where the funding for running this charity society?
23/10/2016, 02:31 - Cindy LEUNG: And then try to come up with a business plan to put in some far away third world country they never even heard of to try and finance someone out of poverty
23/10/2016, 02:32 - Cindy LEUNG: Its all sponsors and fundraising through events
23/10/2016, 02:32 - Mom: ok
23/10/2016, 02:32 - Mom: don't need ask membership fee?
23/10/2016, 02:32 - Cindy LEUNG: Oh yea plus membership
23/10/2016, 02:32 - Cindy LEUNG: But how much can u expect from membership
23/10/2016, 02:33 - Cindy LEUNG: At this point I want my two pounds back
23/10/2016, 02:33 - Mom: lolz
23/10/2016, 02:33 - Mom: do u know how many students they have as members?
23/10/2016, 02:34 - Cindy LEUNG: Quite a lot
23/10/2016, 02:34 - Cindy LEUNG: Its like the unofficial Singaporean club
23/10/2016, 02:34 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz everyone in there is Singaporean
23/10/2016, 02:34 - Mom: wow, that's a lot of money from membership
23/10/2016, 02:34 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea but admin costs
23/10/2016, 02:35 - Cindy LEUNG: Like they need money to run their little musical event which apparently finances all the social projects....
23/10/2016, 02:36 - Mom: never met a white student?
23/10/2016, 02:36 - Cindy LEUNG: No theres like one white guy
23/10/2016, 02:36 - Cindy LEUNG: Which I think is American
23/10/2016, 02:36 - Cindy LEUNG: Actually I don't even know
23/10/2016, 02:37 - Cindy LEUNG: I just feel that the whole thing is really ethically dubious
23/10/2016, 02:37 - Mom: why ethically dubious?
23/10/2016, 02:37 - Mom: illegal?
23/10/2016, 02:38 - Cindy LEUNG: No The idea is that these social projects will generate a revenue so they become sustainable
23/10/2016, 02:38 - Cindy LEUNG: And then they never told us that the project was in such a dire state before I applied
23/10/2016, 02:39 - Cindy LEUNG: And all these ideas they were coming up with like setting up an online store for rural people to sell their trinkets and artisan goods..
23/10/2016, 02:40 - Cindy LEUNG: I'm like have u ever thought abt who the fuck would buy their stuff online.
23/10/2016, 02:41 - Cindy LEUNG: Tbh i seems like a waste of money and time and effort
23/10/2016, 02:42 - Cindy LEUNG: And this is not the only group doing this sort of stuff in lse.
23/10/2016, 02:42 - Cindy LEUNG: I went to other organisations and some of them make small loans to poor people?
23/10/2016, 02:43 - Cindy LEUNG: Isn't that a loan shark?
23/10/2016, 02:43 - Cindy LEUNG: Its not like they don't charge interest and everything
23/10/2016, 02:43 - Cindy LEUNG: So they help poor people by putting them in debt.
23/10/2016, 02:45 - Cindy LEUNG: Intuitively, I just seem to feel that there's something wrong with this whole microfinance business
23/10/2016, 02:45 - Cindy LEUNG: And I don't wanna ruin someone's life so that I hv shit to put on my CV
23/10/2016, 02:47 - Mom: lolz
23/10/2016, 02:48 - Mom: i just browse through their website looking their university list
23/10/2016, 02:48 - Cindy LEUNG: Ok
23/10/2016, 02:48 - Mom: quite a lot but not many very well-known universities
23/10/2016, 02:48 - Cindy LEUNG: Basically every university has one of those enacted groups
23/10/2016, 02:48 - Mom: especially in usa
23/10/2016, 02:49 - Cindy LEUNG: Its like global brigades
23/10/2016, 02:49 - Cindy LEUNG: They go empower people by doing extremely dodgy stuff
23/10/2016, 02:49 - Mom: oh, not even one from japan
23/10/2016, 02:50 - Cindy LEUNG: So u get to put that on Ur CV that u planned a project and helped some poor soul in Honduras
23/10/2016, 02:50 - Cindy LEUNG: By feeding him to the loan sharks
23/10/2016, 02:50 - Mom: sigh
23/10/2016, 02:51 - Mom: the world is running like this all the time
23/10/2016, 02:51 - Mom: no panic
23/10/2016, 02:51 - Mom: i wud rather wonder if they can claim they loan back
23/10/2016, 02:51 - Cindy LEUNG: They use all these business jargon to make it seem really professional
23/10/2016, 02:52 - Mom: and those poor ppl, they're usually under-educated, how wud they possess these tech skills to do business over the internet
23/10/2016, 02:52 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea exactly
23/10/2016, 02:52 - Mom: liars used to be professional
23/10/2016, 02:52 - Cindy LEUNG: Not to mention how to dhl without money
23/10/2016, 02:53 - Cindy LEUNG: There are some ppl who think they r actually doing charity work
23/10/2016, 02:53 - Cindy LEUNG: There
23/10/2016, 02:54 - Mom: even if the plan is real and can be carried out by enactus ppl, think abt the costs and how much money they left for these ppl in under-developed countries?
23/10/2016, 02:55 - Mom: there're always simple mind ppl in the www
23/10/2016, 02:56 - Mom: i had been very active in doing volunteer services at secondary school, and i think i did see a few real pictures abt this industries and understand it
23/10/2016, 02:57 - Cindy LEUNG: So I just feel that it's a bunch of idiots and shrewd CV building people there
23/10/2016, 02:58 - Cindy LEUNG: I think I'm the only one who thinks that way though
23/10/2016, 02:58 - Mom: ÂêÑÂèñÊâÄÈúÄ
23/10/2016, 02:58 - Mom: not necessary
23/10/2016, 02:58 - Cindy LEUNG: Apart from the CV builders ofc
23/10/2016, 02:58 - Mom: but u probably can't pass this emotion through ur ego
23/10/2016, 02:59 - Cindy LEUNG: Yeah I think I should jump ship
23/10/2016, 02:59 - Mom: hahaha
23/10/2016, 02:59 - Cindy LEUNG: They don't even hv a project manager
23/10/2016, 02:59 - Mom: then u don't have social services thingy to brush up ur CV la
23/10/2016, 03:00 - Mom: how wud they hire a project manager
23/10/2016, 03:00 - Mom: as u said they're just student run organisation
23/10/2016, 03:00 - Cindy LEUNG: Like they didn't even assign a team leader
23/10/2016, 03:00 - Mom: with no full-time staff
23/10/2016, 03:00 - Mom: no co-ordinator as well?
23/10/2016, 03:00 - Mom: how do things integrate together?
23/10/2016, 03:01 - Cindy LEUNG: Well theres like a couple of social projects
23/10/2016, 03:01 - Cindy LEUNG: And individual teams work on those
23/10/2016, 03:01 - Cindy LEUNG: But generally there a structure for societies cuz the su help us make one
23/10/2016, 03:02 - Mom: so, who's responsible for liaision or communications between group members and those poor ppl ?
23/10/2016, 03:02 - Cindy LEUNG: Hahahaha
23/10/2016, 03:02 - Mom: lolz
23/10/2016, 03:03 - Mom: looks so rubbish
23/10/2016, 03:03 - Cindy LEUNG: Some person who was on the project last year said he kept in contact with them
23/10/2016, 03:03 - Mom: why don't join the unicef or some other common charity organisation in the beginning?
23/10/2016, 03:03 - Cindy LEUNG: Theres not UNICEF.
23/10/2016, 03:04 - Cindy LEUNG: No unicef or oxfam
23/10/2016, 03:04 - Mom: in lse?
23/10/2016, 03:04 - Cindy LEUNG: There's erm unsoc
23/10/2016, 03:04 - Cindy LEUNG: UNsoc
23/10/2016, 03:04 - Mom: u don't have to pick only from lse
23/10/2016, 03:04 - Cindy LEUNG: They r like the most official charity group
23/10/2016, 03:05 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea I think it's better to find volunteer work from the. Career hub
23/10/2016, 03:05 - Cindy LEUNG: U hv point
23/10/2016, 03:05 - Cindy LEUNG: I didn't think of that
23/10/2016, 03:05 - Mom: what role u want for ur CV, a participant or leadership?
23/10/2016, 03:05 - Mom: if former, then anyone can be
23/10/2016, 03:06 - Cindy LEUNG: Ofc leadership stuff
23/10/2016, 03:06 - Cindy LEUNG: What's the point of participant
23/10/2016, 03:06 - Mom: then this enactus looks unable to fulfill ur expectation
23/10/2016, 03:06 - Cindy LEUNG: I thought they did enterprise stuff
23/10/2016, 03:06 - Cindy LEUNG: So startup like things
23/10/2016, 03:07 - Mom: i mean before u choose which charity work to do, think abt the role u want to engage
23/10/2016, 03:07 - Mom: always startup?
23/10/2016, 03:07 - Cindy LEUNG: They couldn't really start up
23/10/2016, 03:07 - Cindy LEUNG: That's the point
23/10/2016, 03:07 - Mom: u probably mis-interpret it
23/10/2016, 03:07 - Cindy LEUNG: Lol
23/10/2016, 03:08 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea ofc, cuz the business formalities hide so much
23/10/2016, 03:08 - Mom: btw, how do they assign ppl with project?
23/10/2016, 03:08 - Mom: randomly or according to ur interest?
23/10/2016, 03:09 - Cindy LEUNG: No u get to choose
23/10/2016, 03:09 - Cindy LEUNG: But they ask u at the interview
23/10/2016, 03:09 - Mom: ok
23/10/2016, 03:09 - Mom: what yr of student r those interviewers?
23/10/2016, 03:10 - Cindy LEUNG: Second and third?
23/10/2016, 03:10 - Mom: so same age as u?
23/10/2016, 03:10 - Cindy LEUNG: Seems like everyone new is first year
23/10/2016, 03:10 - Cindy LEUNG: Well exec interviews u
23/10/2016, 03:10 - Cindy LEUNG: So there's no way a first year can get onto exec board
23/10/2016, 03:11 - Cindy LEUNG: Typically masters don't bother with this shit
23/10/2016, 03:11 - Mom: why the hell they got expertise to carry out these interviews?
23/10/2016, 03:11 - Mom: just a bunch of kids
23/10/2016, 03:11 - Cindy LEUNG: How else do you recruit?
23/10/2016, 03:12 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea a bunch of kids
23/10/2016, 03:12 - Cindy LEUNG: With no skill
23/10/2016, 03:12 - Mom: u shud go for more mature charity organisation
23/10/2016, 03:12 - Cindy LEUNG: Literally
23/10/2016, 03:12 - Cindy LEUNG: That girl couldn't even take minutes when we told her to do so
23/10/2016, 03:12 - Mom: or u can try start ur own workforce for these online sales
23/10/2016, 03:13 - Mom: hahaha
23/10/2016, 03:13 - Mom: don't waste too much time in this group
23/10/2016, 03:13 - Cindy LEUNG: I know right, now the project is like a sinking ship
23/10/2016, 03:13 - Cindy LEUNG: So basically we need to come up with a new business plan
23/10/2016, 03:14 - Cindy LEUNG: If i had the time to come up with a business plan, I'd start up on my own
23/10/2016, 03:14 - Mom: i wonder u guys know how to write business plan
23/10/2016, 03:14 - Mom: exactly
23/10/2016, 03:14 - Cindy LEUNG: And why would I choose to work with a bunch of unskilled losers
23/10/2016, 03:14 - Mom: keep ur time doing more cost-effective tasks
23/10/2016, 03:14 - Mom: that's ur choice
23/10/2016, 03:14 - Mom: think abt it
23/10/2016, 03:15 - Mom: just keep a name on the society
23/10/2016, 03:15 - Mom: pay min time and cost to it
23/10/2016, 03:15 - Mom: this is my advice
23/10/2016, 03:15 - Cindy LEUNG: Ok
23/10/2016, 03:15 - Cindy LEUNG: Great plan
23/10/2016, 03:15 - Mom: if u pay more time, it's like what u did for film studies in yr12 and 13
23/10/2016, 03:15 - Cindy LEUNG: Yeah don't want that to happen again
23/10/2016, 03:16 - Mom: oh rite, i think u
23/10/2016, 03:16 - Mom: that's a lesson which u shud have learnt for ur whole life
23/10/2016, 03:16 - Cindy LEUNG: I hv too much self initiative to do stuff basically
23/10/2016, 03:16 - Mom: oh i think i find way u can add ur debit card to paypal ac
23/10/2016, 03:17 - Cindy LEUNG: Oh really how
23/10/2016, 03:17 - Mom: i have a paypal uk ac with ur dad's debit card added to the ac

23/10/2016, 03:18 - Cindy LEUNG: What address did u use?
23/10/2016, 03:18 - Mom: i put the address like this: hk address + uk address
23/10/2016, 03:18 - Mom: and then they add it in
23/10/2016, 03:18 - Cindy LEUNG: I tried that already
23/10/2016, 03:18 - Cindy LEUNG: I think it's also cuz I put it in too many times and they blocked my card
23/10/2016, 03:19 - Cindy LEUNG: But once she heard that I was trying to input a Hong Kong address she basically stopped looking into my problem
23/10/2016, 03:19 - Cindy LEUNG: Yah I try that next time I'm bothered to login
23/10/2016, 03:20 - Mom: or u may just input a uk address without hk address
23/10/2016, 03:20 - Mom: the lse address
23/10/2016, 03:20 - Mom: or ur dorm address
23/10/2016, 03:21 - Mom: it doesn't bother it's real address or not cause they don't confirm it with the bank, i learnt it from online
23/10/2016, 03:21 - Cindy LEUNG: I swear I hv given up in PayPal
23/10/2016, 03:21 - Mom: okok
23/10/2016, 03:21 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea thts why I think PayPal blocked my card

23/10/2016, 03:34 - Mom: time is crucial as well as sleep qualities
23/10/2016, 03:34 - Cindy LEUNG: Only the morning nap makes a difference
23/10/2016, 03:34 - Mom: so weird??

23/10/2016, 06:01 - Cindy LEUNG: ... in what way
23/10/2016, 06:01 - Mom: abt ur emotions in the dream?

23/10/2016, 06:01 - Mom: i can say that u dream r a reflection of what's the most unhappy feeling in ur life
23/10/2016, 06:02 - Cindy LEUNG: I thought u don't get scared of horror films
23/10/2016, 06:02 - Cindy LEUNG: Anyways u say that for every dream
23/10/2016, 06:02 - Mom: and the emotions appeared in ur dream has to be dealt with

23/10/2016, 06:05 - Mom: i was asking which side u were just on during ur sleep?
23/10/2016, 06:06 - Mom: it might be the reason why u felt pain on ur chest
23/10/2016, 06:07 - Mom: my interpretation of ur dream is: u got anxiety with some probs and want an end
23/10/2016, 06:07 - Mom: that's why u were killed at the end most of the time
23/10/2016, 06:08 - Mom: the fish thingy and water puddle maybe a representation of ur current studies at lse
23/10/2016, 06:15 - Mom: U wake up at midnight, which makes ur BP to raise and affect ur heart condition
23/10/2016, 06:16 - Mom: That's why u had more headache and heart pain
23/10/2016, 07:22 - Cindy LEUNG: Whatever I went back to sleep anyways
23/10/2016, 07:23 - Cindy LEUNG: I only seem to get anxiety attacks on Thursday nights
23/10/2016, 07:24 - Cindy LEUNG: Probably cuz I get stressed that I have to make it to Friday 9am
23/10/2016, 07:24 - Mom: I'm not talking abt medically anxiety attack, i just talk abt ur emotions

23/10/2016, 07:43 - Mom: don't feel guilty cuz this is not ur/our fault
23/10/2016, 07:43 - Mom: it's their fault

23/10/2016, 08:35 - Mom: why the hell they set their reminder system in that setting letting ppl feel uncomfortable??
23/10/2016, 08:36 - Mom: is one day that rlly important for kgv's finance??
23/10/2016, 08:36 - Mom: they're not banks, they don't carry interest

23/10/2016, 08:47 - Cindy LEUNG: Its like those lates
23/10/2016, 08:47 - Mom: no, the system has to be set by a human being

23/10/2016, 16:49 - Mom: sorry, u mean the course structure r so messy that he's doing postgrad level at undergrad or the course r so easy that he's already finished 70% of the total course content, so he has spare time to do extra acctg course?
23/10/2016, 16:50 - Cindy LEUNG: yea like there's not enough course content
23/10/2016, 16:50 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz it's management
23/10/2016, 16:50 - Cindy LEUNG: so he already did like  70% of the stuff so he's just taking more electives.
23/10/2016, 16:51 - Mom: oh mgt courses r used to be easier
23/10/2016, 16:52 - Mom: u can just study one mgt subject for the whole deg
23/10/2016, 16:52 - Mom: ususally uni add acctg, econ and languages to fill up the spare time
23/10/2016, 16:52 - Cindy LEUNG: hahaha
23/10/2016, 16:52 - Cindy LEUNG: i don't think mgmt can take econ here
23/10/2016, 16:53 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz econ is super hard
23/10/2016, 16:53 - Mom: tbh, nobody wud seriously consider an undergrad mgt deg
23/10/2016, 16:53 - Cindy LEUNG: lol might as well do history.
23/10/2016, 16:53 - Mom: principal of econ
23/10/2016, 16:53 - Mom: or introduction of econ
23/10/2016, 16:53 - Mom: they still need to learn supply and demand
23/10/2016, 16:53 - Cindy LEUNG: yea maybe just intro to econ
23/10/2016, 16:53 - Mom: like a-level subject
23/10/2016, 16:54 - Cindy LEUNG: tbh no one needs to know econ beyond a level
23/10/2016, 16:54 - Mom: rlly? why?
23/10/2016, 16:54 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz all i'm doing right now is just proofing what i learnt last year
23/10/2016, 16:55 - Mom: wth
23/10/2016, 16:55 - Cindy LEUNG: its like advanced math
23/10/2016, 16:55 - Cindy LEUNG: its just proofs
23/10/2016, 16:55 - Cindy LEUNG: like proofing what u already know
23/10/2016, 16:55 - Mom: basically u just need to do maths
23/10/2016, 16:55 - Cindy LEUNG: but u need to be able to prove it
23/10/2016, 16:55 - Cindy LEUNG: and the proving it bit is the insanely hard but unnecessary bit
23/10/2016, 16:56 - Mom: why need the prove part?
23/10/2016, 16:56 - Mom: aren't u learning the econ theory?
23/10/2016, 16:56 - Cindy LEUNG: so u understand the mechanism
23/10/2016, 16:56 - Mom: i mean different school of econ theory
23/10/2016, 16:57 - Cindy LEUNG: no i think that's like masters
23/10/2016, 16:57 - Mom: what?
23/10/2016, 16:57 - Cindy LEUNG: right now its just u proof to yourself that what u learnt last year is true
23/10/2016, 16:57 - Mom: first deg doesn't know any school of econ theory?
23/10/2016, 16:57 - Mom: omg
23/10/2016, 16:57 - Mom: insane
23/10/2016, 16:57 - Cindy LEUNG: hmm u know econ theory
23/10/2016, 16:58 - Mom: different schools
23/10/2016, 16:58 - Cindy LEUNG: lets just say
23/10/2016, 16:58 - Cindy LEUNG: u know the basics like super well
23/10/2016, 16:58 - Cindy LEUNG: u don't really do different schools of thought yet
23/10/2016, 16:58 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz its very theoretical
23/10/2016, 16:58 - Cindy LEUNG: nearly no application at all
23/10/2016, 16:59 - Mom: no, that's for research
23/10/2016, 16:59 - Cindy LEUNG: yea kind of
23/10/2016, 16:59 - Cindy LEUNG: like
23/10/2016, 16:59 - Cindy LEUNG: that
23/10/2016, 16:59 - Mom: u need to know different school of econ theory to do analysis of ur research paper
23/10/2016, 17:00 - Mom: if u don't, how can u formulate a thesis prob?
23/10/2016, 17:00 - Mom: and how can u support ur arguement?
23/10/2016, 17:00 - Mom: in economical way
23/10/2016, 17:00 - Cindy LEUNG: er we don't have to write any essay yet
23/10/2016, 17:01 - Cindy LEUNG: u use a model
23/10/2016, 17:01 - Mom: what abt in yr3?
23/10/2016, 17:01 - Mom: thesis isn't a must for graduation?
23/10/2016, 17:01 - Cindy LEUNG: year 3 is like specialization
23/10/2016, 17:01 - Cindy LEUNG: u get to choose a particular aspect of economics to focus on
23/10/2016, 17:01 - Cindy LEUNG: like labor for example
23/10/2016, 17:02 - Cindy LEUNG: or development
23/10/2016, 17:02 - Cindy LEUNG: yeah there is a dissertation, but that's options
23/10/2016, 17:02 - Cindy LEUNG: optional
23/10/2016, 17:02 - Mom: i wonder if u guys have sufficient academic knowledge to do a good research paper
23/10/2016, 17:02 - Cindy LEUNG: saa
23/10/2016, 17:02 - Mom: omg, optional
23/10/2016, 17:02 - Cindy LEUNG: but i'm in the government dept
23/10/2016, 17:03 - Cindy LEUNG: so i'll have to write a gov paper
23/10/2016, 17:03 - Mom: even i need a dissertation when i grad in hk
23/10/2016, 17:03 - Cindy LEUNG: yeah im considering doing dissertation
23/10/2016, 17:03 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz high percentage of firsts
23/10/2016, 17:03 - Mom: dissertation takes a lot of time
23/10/2016, 17:04 - Mom: but tbh, won't fail u
23/10/2016, 17:04 - Mom: brb, take shower
23/10/2016, 17:04 - Cindy LEUNG: its equivalent to one full year course
23/10/2016, 17:04 - Cindy LEUNG: so i would imagine it to take a lot of time
23/10/2016, 17:16 - Mom: ok
23/10/2016, 17:16 - Mom: i'm back
23/10/2016, 17:16 - Cindy LEUNG: hi

23/10/2016, 17:32 - Cindy LEUNG: finally got to taxes
23/10/2016, 17:32 - Cindy LEUNG: and labor
23/10/2016, 17:32 - Cindy LEUNG: omg
23/10/2016, 17:33 - Mom: what?
23/10/2016, 17:33 - Cindy LEUNG: and then on the other hand, lse100 expects u to learn ir in 4 weeks
23/10/2016, 17:33 - Mom: lse 100 doesn't need exam, set it in low priority
23/10/2016, 17:33 - Cindy LEUNG: i gotta do assessmenets
23/10/2016, 17:33 - Cindy LEUNG: need to pass

24/10/2016, 02:49 - Cindy LEUNG: I just tried to sleep for abt 20 mins
24/10/2016, 02:49 - Cindy LEUNG: And my brain has just become crazy
24/10/2016, 02:50 - Cindy LEUNG: I'm really confused right now
24/10/2016, 04:30 - Mom: What happened?
24/10/2016, 05:01 - Cindy LEUNG: Awake again
24/10/2016, 05:03 - Mom: what happened ah?
24/10/2016, 05:04 - Mom: and don't understand "haihendesu"?
24/10/2016, 05:04 - Cindy LEUNG: Taihen desu
24/10/2016, 05:05 - Cindy LEUNG: I forgot what exactly happened now
24/10/2016, 05:05 - Cindy LEUNG: I think I kept having dream of being stabbed or something
24/10/2016, 05:06 - Cindy LEUNG: Or was this the monster dream
24/10/2016, 05:06 - Mom: u dreamed being attacked again?
24/10/2016, 05:07 - Cindy LEUNG: I had a dream where I was running from monsters which ate me and emos
24/10/2016, 05:07 - Cindy LEUNG: And then I had to fight them by hand
24/10/2016, 05:08 - Mom: did u win?
24/10/2016, 05:08 - Cindy LEUNG: And then I think the first time I texted u
24/10/2016, 05:08 - Cindy LEUNG: Oh I remember
24/10/2016, 05:08 - Cindy LEUNG: I tried to sleep with the lights off at first
24/10/2016, 05:09 - Cindy LEUNG: And then the moment I was in the dark I had increasing levels of anxiety
24/10/2016, 05:09 - Cindy LEUNG: So I gave up
24/10/2016, 05:09 - Cindy LEUNG: Then I started drifting off
24/10/2016, 05:10 - Cindy LEUNG: I kept thinking that I could hear it rain really heavy outside
24/10/2016, 05:10 - Cindy LEUNG: And I was worried that shit might fly in cuZ I Had the window open
24/10/2016, 05:11 - Cindy LEUNG: So I kept physically getting up to close it more
24/10/2016, 05:11 - Cindy LEUNG: This is real
24/10/2016, 05:12 - Cindy LEUNG: And then after a while I thought there were people working in the kitchen since I kept hearing really old school MSN messenger notification sounds
24/10/2016, 05:13 - Mom: then?
24/10/2016, 05:14 - Cindy LEUNG: Then after like 20 mins I basically woke up to turn off the extractor and that fully woke me up
24/10/2016, 05:14 - Cindy LEUNG: And then all of this stuff stopped
24/10/2016, 05:15 - Mom: 1. is the window opened before u got up to close it?
24/10/2016, 05:15 - Cindy LEUNG: I kept getting images of being stabbed when I tried to sleep in the beginning
24/10/2016, 05:15 - Cindy LEUNG: Yes
24/10/2016, 05:16 - Mom: 2. did u continuously heard sound of MSN msger for like 20 mins until u woke up
24/10/2016, 05:16 - Cindy LEUNG: I wanted to keep the window slightly open for the wind to come in
24/10/2016, 05:16 - Cindy LEUNG: But I kept thinking that the storm outside blew the window open all the way
24/10/2016, 05:16 - Mom: did u see the face of that person stabbing u and do u recognise him?
24/10/2016, 05:17 - Cindy LEUNG: No and why do u assume him
24/10/2016, 05:17 - Mom: its her ?
24/10/2016, 05:17 - Cindy LEUNG: Its not a person
24/10/2016, 05:17 - Mom: what's it?
24/10/2016, 05:17 - Cindy LEUNG: Its just like
24/10/2016, 05:17 - Cindy LEUNG: I don't know
24/10/2016, 05:17 - Cindy LEUNG: Just being stabbed
24/10/2016, 05:18 - Cindy LEUNG: Like close-up of being syabbed
24/10/2016, 05:18 - Mom: can u describe that thingy?
24/10/2016, 05:18 - Mom: how it looked like?
24/10/2016, 05:18 - Cindy LEUNG: 2. Not sure, I heard the messenger sound a few times not continuous
24/10/2016, 05:19 - Cindy LEUNG: Can't describe cuz I can't remember, I just remember being stabbed
24/10/2016, 05:19 - Mom: ok
24/10/2016, 05:19 - Mom: that means u don't understand where ur anxiety comes from?
24/10/2016, 05:19 - Mom: but still ur scared
24/10/2016, 05:19 - Cindy LEUNG: No lah
24/10/2016, 05:19 - Mom: of that hidden thingy
24/10/2016, 05:19 - Cindy LEUNG: Dude stop interpreting the dreams
24/10/2016, 05:20 - Cindy LEUNG: The were like hallucinatory
24/10/2016, 05:20 - Mom: u know ur emotions then u know how to deal with it?
24/10/2016, 05:20 - Cindy LEUNG: Omg
24/10/2016, 05:21 - Cindy LEUNG: Its not even to do with emotions anymore.
24/10/2016, 05:21 - Cindy LEUNG: Its just anxiety
24/10/2016, 05:21 - Cindy LEUNG: In its pure form
24/10/2016, 05:21 - Mom: even if u go to psychiatrist, they wud probably ask same questions
24/10/2016, 05:21 - Mom: i guess
24/10/2016, 05:21 - Cindy LEUNG: Sigh
24/10/2016, 05:22 - Cindy LEUNG: I need to find like a bedmate or something
24/10/2016, 05:22 - Mom: that wud be better if u sleep with someone
24/10/2016, 05:22 - Cindy LEUNG: I keep getting attacked
24/10/2016, 05:22 - Cindy LEUNG: And it's making the anxiety worse
24/10/2016, 05:23 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz now I get attacks in the dark
24/10/2016, 05:23 - Mom: being attacked is a form of ur anxiety appearing in ur dream
24/10/2016, 05:23 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea ok whatever
24/10/2016, 05:23 - Mom: the attacks r not real, just a reflection of ur anxiety
24/10/2016, 05:23 - Cindy LEUNG: Im talking abt physical anxiety attacks
24/10/2016, 05:23 - Mom: how often do u have this kind of dream in hk?
24/10/2016, 05:23 - Cindy LEUNG: Like increase hr
24/10/2016, 05:24 - Cindy LEUNG: Hyperventilation
24/10/2016, 05:24 - Cindy LEUNG: My limbs start freezing
24/10/2016, 05:24 - Cindy LEUNG: I literally turn the lights back on cuz I can't stand it
24/10/2016, 05:24 - Cindy LEUNG: Like a phobia or something
24/10/2016, 05:25 - Mom: those r ur body's physical reaction to that anxiety
24/10/2016, 05:25 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea I try to tell u I hv physical anxiety attacks
24/10/2016, 05:25 - Cindy LEUNG: I'm not talking abt bring scared in dream
24/10/2016, 05:25 - Mom: i know, but the origin is emotional feeling??
24/10/2016, 05:26 - Cindy LEUNG: Idk
24/10/2016, 05:26 - Mom: nothing comes when there's no triggering event
24/10/2016, 05:26 - Mom: u scare of the dark, this is an emotional response
24/10/2016, 05:26 - Cindy LEUNG: In gen, my amygdala is really active when I sleep
24/10/2016, 05:26 - Mom: and then it initiates ur body's physical response
24/10/2016, 05:27 - Mom: the amygdala in general shud be very active when ppl rest becos it's responsible for transforming short-term memories into long-term meomories
24/10/2016, 05:27 - Cindy LEUNG: I just have slight fear of the dark, shouldnt be full blown phobia
24/10/2016, 05:28 - Mom: so when ur sleeping, ur amygdala is always working very hard
24/10/2016, 05:28 - Mom: then sleep with lights on
24/10/2016, 05:28 - Cindy LEUNG: I hv to weae sunglasses when I sleep
24/10/2016, 05:28 - Mom: wear a mask if u can cuz this is better for those melatonin production
24/10/2016, 05:29 - Cindy LEUNG: Then I'll be in the dark
24/10/2016, 05:29 - Mom: u know the lights r on?
24/10/2016, 05:29 - Cindy LEUNG: So
24/10/2016, 05:29 - Cindy LEUNG: Blindfold only contributes to increasing lack. Of security
24/10/2016, 05:29 - Mom: okok, keep the lights on until u feel comfortable again
24/10/2016, 05:30 - Cindy LEUNG: Well ofc
24/10/2016, 05:30 - Cindy LEUNG: But this is really shittt

24/10/2016, 05:37 - Cindy LEUNG: I was like super confused
24/10/2016, 05:38 - Cindy LEUNG: When I woke up at 5am I was thinking that maybe my brain structure has changed so that i can't sleep for more than 3 hr s
24/10/2016, 05:38 - Cindy LEUNG: See difference
24/10/2016, 05:39 - Mom: sigh

24/10/2016, 05:42 - Cindy LEUNG: I think it's quite obvious I hv bad anxiety, there's really no point in interpreting that from the dreams anyways
24/10/2016, 05:42 - Cindy LEUNG: Anymore
24/10/2016, 05:42 - Mom: do u need drugs?
24/10/2016, 05:42 - Cindy LEUNG: If there is a drug to calm down the dreams that would be amazing

25/10/2016, 04:07 - Cindy LEUNG: I haven't really seen any parents around
25/10/2016, 04:09 - Cindy LEUNG: But then cuz they r all mainlander and basically their family just abandon them here
25/10/2016, 04:10 - Cindy LEUNG: Or maybe i just got used to seeing the Russian girl's parents
25/10/2016, 05:02 - Mom: sigh
25/10/2016, 05:03 - Mom: as u said the russian girl's parents live in london as well
25/10/2016, 05:03 - Mom: they might have rent a house there
25/10/2016, 05:04 - Mom: btw, do visitors need to sign in or register at the reception area of wsba?
25/10/2016, 07:29 - Cindy LEUNG: No they live in Moscow and NYC

25/10/2016, 07:31 - Cindy LEUNG: Apparently it helps with fatigue
25/10/2016, 07:32 - Cindy LEUNG: And there's this thing called myocin? It looks kind of effective
25/10/2016, 07:43 - Mom: d ribose for boosting heart muscles after a heart attack?
25/10/2016, 07:44 - Mom: myocin? antibiotics?
25/10/2016, 07:45 - Mom: seems u start over ur drug trial session again
25/10/2016, 07:50 - Cindy LEUNG: They r supplements
25/10/2016, 07:50 - Cindy LEUNG: Might as well
25/10/2016, 07:50 - Cindy LEUNG: I only saw two people on resist askdoctor who had chronic nightmares
25/10/2016, 07:50 - Cindy LEUNG: Reddit
25/10/2016, 08:13 - Mom: Even baby kingdom has a lot ppl talking abt their insonmia
25/10/2016, 08:42 - Mom: R the russian girl's parents businessman?
25/10/2016, 09:45 - Cindy LEUNG: No her father is a scientist
25/10/2016, 09:46 - Cindy LEUNG: I forgot what her mom does
25/10/2016, 09:47 - Cindy LEUNG: Her situation was quite strange. Her father lives in Moscow and her mom lives in NYC and she goes to some other place for uni
25/10/2016, 09:49 - Mom: is she the only child in her family?
25/10/2016, 09:49 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea I think so
25/10/2016, 09:50 - Cindy LEUNG: If she had a brother in Australia that would be even weirder
25/10/2016, 09:50 - Mom: she did have brother?
25/10/2016, 09:50 - Cindy LEUNG: Dude I used if

25/10/2016, 09:51 - Mom: i guess ur challenging my question before, thought that was silly
25/10/2016, 09:51 - Mom: anyway, different family structure, can't compare
25/10/2016, 10:02 - Cindy LEUNG: Omg

25/10/2016, 10:04 - Mom: so u get slim?
25/10/2016, 10:04 - Cindy LEUNG: Still 70kg though
25/10/2016, 10:04 - Mom: redistribution of body fat
25/10/2016, 10:04 - Cindy LEUNG: I just tightened the straps
25/10/2016, 10:05 - Cindy LEUNG: And it's still loose at max
25/10/2016, 10:05 - Mom: perhaps its the material of those bras getting loose after some time??
25/10/2016, 10:06 - Mom: cuz i found those bras material is so soft in the beginning
25/10/2016, 10:07 - Mom: get ur chest measured to see if they change
25/10/2016, 10:08 - Cindy LEUNG: Oh Nevermind
25/10/2016, 10:08 - Cindy LEUNG: I found how to tighten the straps
25/10/2016, 10:08 - Cindy LEUNG: Its back to normal again
25/10/2016, 10:09 - Mom: üôÉ
25/10/2016, 10:09 - Mom: üò≥
25/10/2016, 10:12 - Mom: hi

25/10/2016, 10:18 - Mom: so u did st107 and ma107 last yr?
25/10/2016, 10:51 - Cindy LEUNG: Yep
25/10/2016, 11:07 - Mom: How's ur thought abt subject this yr?
25/10/2016, 11:07 - Cindy LEUNG: which subject?
25/10/2016, 11:08 - Mom: Ur fm?
25/10/2016, 11:08 - Cindy LEUNG: i;m sure everyone knows my thoughts about micro and macro now
25/10/2016, 11:08 - Cindy LEUNG: fm is ok
25/10/2016, 11:08 - Cindy LEUNG: its pretty standard
25/10/2016, 11:08 - Cindy LEUNG: u just learn from the bma textbook
25/10/2016, 11:08 - Cindy LEUNG: which is pretty much the intro to finance bible
25/10/2016, 11:08 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz yale, mit, other ivies all use this one
25/10/2016, 11:08 - Mom: No, i mean do u still dropping fm?
25/10/2016, 11:08 - Cindy LEUNG: no can't
25/10/2016, 11:09 - Cindy LEUNG: i looked at the st202 textbook and put it down immediately
25/10/2016, 11:09 - Mom: K
25/10/2016, 11:09 - Cindy LEUNG: its impossible without basic couse in linear algebra
25/10/2016, 11:09 - Cindy LEUNG: i should have done ma100 in first year
25/10/2016, 11:09 - Cindy LEUNG: regrets
25/10/2016, 11:11 - Mom: That's elementary linear algebra rite
25/10/2016, 11:11 - Mom: Do it with harvard/mit online course
25/10/2016, 11:12 - Mom: Also, u need st107 to do econmetric third yr
25/10/2016, 11:12 - Cindy LEUNG: i already did st107
25/10/2016, 11:12 - Cindy LEUNG: thats why i plan to do metric
25/10/2016, 11:12 - Cindy LEUNG: but then ive discovered that there are two metric courses
25/10/2016, 11:13 - Cindy LEUNG: and it says on their webpage that the more difficult one is sufficient as preparation for any masters level course in economics
25/10/2016, 11:13 - Cindy LEUNG: it didn't mention the easier one
25/10/2016, 11:13 - Cindy LEUNG: so i took their course pack
25/10/2016, 11:13 - Cindy LEUNG: and i'm just gonna look through it over the summer
25/10/2016, 11:14 - Cindy LEUNG: plus learn linear alegbr
25/10/2016, 11:14 - Mom: Ok
25/10/2016, 11:14 - Cindy LEUNG: i'm so glad i did the game theory course before hand
25/10/2016, 11:14 - Mom: K
25/10/2016, 11:14 - Cindy LEUNG: the government people are shit at teaching game theory
25/10/2016, 11:15 - Cindy LEUNG: so that was one smart move
25/10/2016, 11:15 - Cindy LEUNG: phew
25/10/2016, 11:15 - Cindy LEUNG: u don't know how relieved i am
25/10/2016, 11:16 - Mom: üòÆüòÆ
25/10/2016, 11:17 - Cindy LEUNG: i feel like im in a sinking ship but i have a life jacket
25/10/2016, 11:17 - Cindy LEUNG: that's ow relieved i am
25/10/2016, 11:18 - Mom: üò≥üò≥
25/10/2016, 11:19 - Cindy LEUNG: yup yup, just one month in and i feel like the ship is slowly sinking already.
25/10/2016, 11:28 - Mom: Omg
25/10/2016, 11:30 - Cindy LEUNG: that is a very fitting analogy
25/10/2016, 11:30 - Mom: Lolz
25/10/2016, 11:31 - Cindy LEUNG: my kcl friend
25/10/2016, 11:31 - Cindy LEUNG: said he knows a med student
25/10/2016, 11:31 - Cindy LEUNG: and he is dying as well
25/10/2016, 11:32 - Cindy LEUNG: my mech eng friend is always dying
25/10/2016, 11:32 - Cindy LEUNG: why london uni so tough
25/10/2016, 11:33 - Mom: Great
25/10/2016, 11:33 - Mom: Heavy workload?
25/10/2016, 11:33 - Cindy LEUNG: they teach us like we're geniuses
25/10/2016, 11:34 - Cindy LEUNG: like we can do the math on teh spot in teh lecture
25/10/2016, 11:34 - Cindy LEUNG: and understand and follow everything they're saying
25/10/2016, 11:38 - Mom: Med & eng  shud be like that
25/10/2016, 11:38 - Mom: Only hk unis different
25/10/2016, 11:38 - Mom: Or maybe dome us unis
25/10/2016, 11:38 - Mom: Becos ur in lse which is world class uni rite??
25/10/2016, 11:39 - Cindy LEUNG: maybe
25/10/2016, 11:39 - Cindy LEUNG: i dunno i was seriously considering taking a gap year yesterday
25/10/2016, 11:40 - Cindy LEUNG: though i don't know how beneficial that would be to my health prob
25/10/2016, 11:41 - Cindy LEUNG: since it just seems to get worse again once i get slightly stressed
25/10/2016, 11:42 - Cindy LEUNG: i think it would be good use of time to fill in gaps in knowledge though
25/10/2016, 11:43 - Cindy LEUNG: on the other hand, i feel like i'm almost half way through the year
25/10/2016, 11:43 - Cindy LEUNG: and it would be a waste to take a gap now and redo second yr
25/10/2016, 11:44 - Cindy LEUNG: so if i defer third year i might as well just get it over with
25/10/2016, 11:45 - Cindy LEUNG: maybe i could find a year of exchange or something
25/10/2016, 11:56 - Mom: sigh
25/10/2016, 11:57 - Mom: school yr has started already, it's difficult to find exchange now
25/10/2016, 11:58 - Cindy LEUNG: yah i meant for next year
25/10/2016, 11:58 - Mom: but still have to do this yr's courses and their grades rlly matters
25/10/2016, 11:59 - Mom: difficult situation
25/10/2016, 11:59 - Cindy LEUNG: well i don't think i'll do too badly
25/10/2016, 11:59 - Cindy LEUNG: after revision
25/10/2016, 11:59 - Mom: it looks like everytime u go back to london, ur condition/sleep prob get worse
25/10/2016, 12:00 - Cindy LEUNG: just now the work is a lot and the pace is fast and my sleep schedule is very unpredictable
25/10/2016, 12:00 - Mom: u know, i rlly want to stay in london with u all the yr
25/10/2016, 12:01 - Mom: but when i think of emos, she is also in this critical yr and i rlly don't trust ur dad to look after her
25/10/2016, 12:01 - Cindy LEUNG: yeah
25/10/2016, 12:02 - Mom: u know, emos is not person with initiative, she used to sleep all the day if nobody is here
25/10/2016, 12:02 - Mom: this is pretty headache
25/10/2016, 12:02 - Mom: she's smart but she's not independent
25/10/2016, 12:02 - Cindy LEUNG: yah cuz i feel ok now
25/10/2016, 12:03 - Cindy LEUNG: but then if i get an anxiety attack at night
25/10/2016, 12:03 - Cindy LEUNG: then i tend to not be able to concentrate the next day
25/10/2016, 12:04 - Mom: sigh
25/10/2016, 12:04 - Cindy LEUNG: i think the pilates helps though
25/10/2016, 12:04 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz i do that on monday and i feel like i do better during the start of the week
25/10/2016, 12:05 - Mom: u know i just return home, i was walking by the clinic on the opposite side of tst tower
25/10/2016, 12:07 - Mom: in which the doc claim he treat "anxiety disorders like ÊÄùË¶∫Â§±Ë™ø... , i was thinking if i cud go there for treatment with ur symptoms, then i can have medications, then i'll send them to u
25/10/2016, 12:08 - Mom: where's ur friend live? will it be possible that u guys tried to live together in an appartment??
25/10/2016, 12:08 - Cindy LEUNG: u mean my king's friend?
25/10/2016, 12:08 - Cindy LEUNG: he lives in a studio
25/10/2016, 12:09 - Mom: yea
25/10/2016, 12:09 - Cindy LEUNG: like 30 mins down the road
25/10/2016, 12:10 - Mom: even thought stay in own private room, but still inside the same flat, which i think wud be a sense of relieve
25/10/2016, 12:10 - Mom: it's far better than now, living with nobody around, just 2 mandos
25/10/2016, 12:10 - Cindy LEUNG: lul just two mandos
25/10/2016, 12:11 - Mom: tbh, ur living condition is far better last yr
25/10/2016, 12:11 - Mom: as least u have someone to talk to
25/10/2016, 12:15 - Cindy LEUNG: Hmm I think it's just I don't hv someone to talk to abt my health problems specifically
25/10/2016, 12:16 - Mom: u know, when ur at home, ur condition is far more better cuz u have us to talk with
25/10/2016, 12:17 - Mom: but when ur back to london, especially surrounded by those 2 mandos, a total different pic
25/10/2016, 12:17 - Cindy LEUNG: hmm thats the ting
25/10/2016, 12:17 - Cindy LEUNG: thing
25/10/2016, 12:17 - Mom: yea
25/10/2016, 12:17 - Cindy LEUNG: i don't know if its peer support or just the pacing of the workload
25/10/2016, 12:18 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz the work is pretty stressful
25/10/2016, 12:18 - Cindy LEUNG: especially when the teaching is so bad
25/10/2016, 12:19 - Mom: pacing of studies do give u stress, but i guess u have no close friend to talk to, that even worsen ur anxiety
25/10/2016, 12:20 - Mom: tbh, everybody works on their own in uni
25/10/2016, 12:20 - Mom: u can't expect tutors/professors to teach u as in elementary skl
25/10/2016, 12:21 - Mom: and bad teachers r all over the world and everywhere
25/10/2016, 12:21 - Mom: can u think of how many good/responsible teachers u met during ur studies until now?
25/10/2016, 12:21 - Mom: i guess just handful
25/10/2016, 12:22 - Mom: u just need to maintain good relationship with them only for reference purpose
25/10/2016, 12:23 - Mom: if they're fair in marking ur exam/test papers and give a fair grade, that's all good thing
25/10/2016, 12:24 - Cindy LEUNG: ok
25/10/2016, 12:24 - Cindy LEUNG: i think the pilates is helpful though
25/10/2016, 12:24 - Mom: good
25/10/2016, 12:24 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz the breathing exercise is good
25/10/2016, 12:24 - Mom: can u do it twice in a week
25/10/2016, 12:25 - Cindy LEUNG: yah maybe i should do i ttwice a week
25/10/2016, 12:25 - Cindy LEUNG: but they only have once a week at lse
25/10/2016, 12:25 - Mom: go do it in other gym
25/10/2016, 12:25 - Cindy LEUNG: then i need to join the gym and pay membership =.=
25/10/2016, 12:25 - Mom: or can u pay lse for more lessons?
25/10/2016, 12:26 - Mom: 30 pp rite?

25/10/2016, 12:35 - Mom: ppl in lse counselling dept cuz u hv a file there

25/10/2016, 12:37 - Cindy LEUNG: i probably worry more about telling people i see things.
25/10/2016, 12:37 - Cindy LEUNG: yah i dont have trust friends
25/10/2016, 12:37 - Cindy LEUNG: and people don't want to carry ur emotional baggage

26/10/2016, 12:44 - Mom: i was talking to u at the mtr
26/10/2016, 12:45 - Mom: and then i ate my dinner
26/10/2016, 12:45 - Mom: then search for this music
26/10/2016, 12:46 - Mom: what kind of music is that?
26/10/2016, 12:46 - Mom: just noisy thing
26/10/2016, 12:47 - Mom: even worse than the rock music
26/10/2016, 12:47 - Mom: üò©üò©
26/10/2016, 12:48 - Cindy LEUNG: Its dubstep
26/10/2016, 12:48 - Mom: what is it?
26/10/2016, 12:48 - Cindy LEUNG: But did u feel scared in the middle?
26/10/2016, 12:48 - Cindy LEUNG: Electronic
26/10/2016, 12:48 - Mom: not rlly cuz u warn me in advance
26/10/2016, 12:49 - Cindy LEUNG: Hmm
26/10/2016, 12:49 - Cindy LEUNG: But I was thinking abt it in the shower
26/10/2016, 12:49 - Mom: but as i said, its kind of like u can imagine a scene of someone going to do some horrible thing
26/10/2016, 12:49 - Cindy LEUNG: And then I started to get anxiety
26/10/2016, 12:49 - Mom: like killing someone
26/10/2016, 12:49 - Mom: omg
26/10/2016, 12:50 - Mom: u shudn't watch this kind of movie or relevant music as well
26/10/2016, 12:50 - Mom: ur imagination is so wonderful??
26/10/2016, 12:50 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea I thought second part where u find out it's a stalker and they break into Ur house and say that Ur gonna die kind of scary
26/10/2016, 12:51 - Mom: not rlly, but i can sense what u said
26/10/2016, 12:51 - Cindy LEUNG: Its like normal at the start and u don't expect to be attacked in the second part.
26/10/2016, 12:51 - Mom: and that woman's voice is not that scary
26/10/2016, 12:51 - Cindy LEUNG: Its not a woman
26/10/2016, 12:52 - Mom: u can say so
26/10/2016, 12:52 - Cindy LEUNG: Its like Google voice
26/10/2016, 12:52 - Mom: not a woman?
26/10/2016, 12:52 - Cindy LEUNG: Its a bot
26/10/2016, 12:52 - Cindy LEUNG: Like siri
26/10/2016, 12:52 - Mom: robot?
26/10/2016, 12:52 - Cindy LEUNG: Hence internet friend
26/10/2016, 12:52 - Cindy LEUNG: Its a really clever song imo
26/10/2016, 12:52 - Mom: i don't know, but it sounds like a woman's voice
26/10/2016, 12:52 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea sure sounds like a woman
26/10/2016, 12:52 - Mom: cuz it said bitch and fuck thingy
26/10/2016, 12:53 - Mom: the main character must be a woman
26/10/2016, 12:53 - Mom: she worn high heels
26/10/2016, 12:53 - Cindy LEUNG: Hmm a female bot
26/10/2016, 12:53 - Cindy LEUNG: Ok if u remember to that detail
26/10/2016, 12:53 - Cindy LEUNG: Fair enough
26/10/2016, 12:53 - Mom: yea
26/10/2016, 12:54 - Mom: high heel, door knocking, telephone
26/10/2016, 12:54 - Cindy LEUNG: Then I think it was probably tinder...
26/10/2016, 12:54 - Cindy LEUNG: Whatever
26/10/2016, 12:54 - Cindy LEUNG: U get the point.
26/10/2016, 12:55 - Cindy LEUNG: Maybe it's just me. Cuz I don't think it's supposed to be scary
26/10/2016, 12:55 - Cindy LEUNG: Maybe just creepy
26/10/2016, 12:56 - Mom: u can create this scary scene in ur mind when u were listening to that music
26/10/2016, 12:57 - Mom: but as i said that didn't bother my mind so much
26/10/2016, 12:58 - Cindy LEUNG: Hmm m
26/10/2016, 12:58 - Mom: that middle part formed a complete story and link the first and the last part
26/10/2016, 12:58 - Cindy LEUNG: Maybe
26/10/2016, 12:59 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea it's a story
26/10/2016, 12:59 - Mom: like u were watching a movie
26/10/2016, 12:59 - Cindy LEUNG: But here the weird thing
26/10/2016, 12:59 - Cindy LEUNG: There's another one abt a centipede
26/10/2016, 12:59 - Cindy LEUNG: I listened to that one too, I didn't get anxiety from that onr
26/10/2016, 13:00 - Mom: same kind of music?
26/10/2016, 13:00 - Mom: how can the story of a centipede create a scary story?
26/10/2016, 13:01 - Cindy LEUNG: Its called centipede
26/10/2016, 13:02 - Cindy LEUNG: Its similar
26/10/2016, 13:02 - Cindy LEUNG: Listen to that one
26/10/2016, 13:02 - Mom: ok
26/10/2016, 13:02 - Mom: i'll go for it now
26/10/2016, 13:07 - Mom: have u watch the youtube video abt this centipede music?
26/10/2016, 13:07 - Cindy LEUNG: No
26/10/2016, 13:08 - Cindy LEUNG: I listened to all of this in Starbucks
26/10/2016, 13:08 - Mom: strongly advise u not to watch it
26/10/2016, 13:08 - Mom: cuz its kind of violent
26/10/2016, 13:08 - Cindy LEUNG: Kk not planning to
26/10/2016, 13:08 - Mom: the music doesn't form a clear story but the video is so violent
26/10/2016, 13:09 - Mom: especially at the end
26/10/2016, 13:09 - Cindy LEUNG: Well the octopus video by panic at the disco was violent
26/10/2016, 13:09 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea it's abt the centipede
26/10/2016, 13:09 - Mom: u def wud have nightmare if u watch it
26/10/2016, 13:09 - Cindy LEUNG: I'm trying to work out what exactly I'm afraid of
26/10/2016, 13:10 - Mom: i think it's ur imagination or creativity that makes u anxiety
26/10/2016, 13:10 - Mom: cuz u'll form new scary pic in ur mind
26/10/2016, 13:10 - Cindy LEUNG: But certain things which should be scary I do not hv problem with
26/10/2016, 13:11 - Mom: and then some days later, adding some other clues to make a horror movie
26/10/2016, 13:11 - Mom: like?
26/10/2016, 13:11 - Mom: animals, insects?
26/10/2016, 13:12 - Cindy LEUNG: I'm scared of insects irl
26/10/2016, 13:12 - Cindy LEUNG: But the song I was ok
26/10/2016, 13:13 - Mom: just listen to that music is ok
26/10/2016, 13:13 - Mom: cuz u wudn't have too much inference from it
26/10/2016, 13:14 - Mom: for the internet friends, that's the middle high heel walking, door knocking... part formed the whole story
26/10/2016, 13:14 - Mom: that made u feel like watching a killing movie
26/10/2016, 13:15 - Mom: that one is more cinematographic
26/10/2016, 13:16 - Mom: so u wud have formed a more stronger memory abt that music
26/10/2016, 14:16 - Cindy LEUNG: Hi sorry I'm back
26/10/2016, 14:16 - Cindy LEUNG: I just had a meeting
26/10/2016, 14:17 - Cindy LEUNG: Hmm I guess u hv a point abt the cinematographic Ness of the song
26/10/2016, 14:18 - Cindy LEUNG: But I'm thinking more along the lines of that what I'm scared of is similar to that of a stalker
26/10/2016, 14:19 - Cindy LEUNG: In other words, I think it seems to be related with my mistrust of people?
26/10/2016, 14:20 - Mom: u have ur point
26/10/2016, 14:21 - Mom: ur anxiety comes from stalker?
26/10/2016, 14:21 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea and I think it's probably not the violence
26/10/2016, 14:21 - Cindy LEUNG: The violence just makes it a bad experience
26/10/2016, 14:21 - Mom: that's why u always dreamed being attacked and stabbed
26/10/2016, 14:22 - Mom: ic ur worry la
26/10/2016, 14:22 - Cindy LEUNG: But the fear stems from the fact that the attacker is a person.
26/10/2016, 14:23 - Mom: the attacker in ur bad dreams were always human beings?
26/10/2016, 14:24 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea
26/10/2016, 14:24 - Cindy LEUNG: People
26/10/2016, 14:24 - Cindy LEUNG: A person
26/10/2016, 14:24 - Mom: oh, it sounds like u rlly has srs distrust abt ppl
26/10/2016, 14:25 - Mom: is this from ur childhood cuz u were always cheated by ur parents?
26/10/2016, 14:25 - Cindy LEUNG: Possibly someone I was interacting in friendly manner and then they attack me
26/10/2016, 14:25 - Mom: who do u think that person is?
26/10/2016, 14:26 - Cindy LEUNG: Or old high school friend who I only vaguely knew and then suddenly abuses and attacks me
26/10/2016, 14:26 - Mom: that single parent kgv/kjs sklmate?
26/10/2016, 14:26 - Mom: who? can u think of anyone?
26/10/2016, 14:26 - Cindy LEUNG: More like school mate
26/10/2016, 14:26 - Cindy LEUNG: Idk could be anyone, its not recurring not specific to one persob
26/10/2016, 14:26 - Mom: i think so cuz they're the ppl u interact most often
26/10/2016, 14:27 - Mom: ok
26/10/2016, 14:27 - Cindy LEUNG: But sometimes its the first one
26/10/2016, 14:27 - Cindy LEUNG: Like unknown strangers
26/10/2016, 14:27 - Mom: so ur fear comes from being stalked and watched/spied by someone?
26/10/2016, 14:27 - Cindy LEUNG: I get along with in beginning and then suddenly attack me
26/10/2016, 14:28 - Mom: yea, the first person used to have a profound effect
26/10/2016, 14:28 - Cindy LEUNG: No maybe fear of the people who I though I knew who they were turns out to be a different person
26/10/2016, 14:28 - Mom: oh yea, looks similar to the scenario in ur dream
26/10/2016, 14:28 - Cindy LEUNG: Not specifically a stalker
26/10/2016, 14:29 - Mom: wow
26/10/2016, 14:29 - Cindy LEUNG: So like the song, u make a friend through internet and then they turn out to be a stalker
26/10/2016, 14:29 - Mom: yea that's understandable
26/10/2016, 14:29 - Cindy LEUNG: Maybe cuz
26/10/2016, 14:30 - Cindy LEUNG: When I was sick in yr13 I experienced that
26/10/2016, 14:30 - Mom: ooooh
26/10/2016, 14:30 - Mom: i get ur point
26/10/2016, 14:30 - Cindy LEUNG: Like ppl I thought were friends were not friend
26/10/2016, 14:30 - Mom: ur subconscious mind has been hurt
26/10/2016, 14:31 - Cindy LEUNG: So I hv increased anxiety abt people now.
26/10/2016, 14:31 - Mom: üò≥üò≥üò≥üò≥
26/10/2016, 14:31 - Cindy LEUNG: But why they attack me.
26/10/2016, 14:32 - Mom: sigh
26/10/2016, 14:32 - Mom: this explanation sounds logical
26/10/2016, 14:32 - Cindy LEUNG: I mean I never see my teachers
26/10/2016, 14:32 - Cindy LEUNG: Or parents
26/10/2016, 14:32 - Cindy LEUNG: Or emos
26/10/2016, 14:33 - Cindy LEUNG: Its always someone I was kind of friends with and not very close friends
26/10/2016, 14:33 - Mom: so ppl attacking u in ur dreams were all at ur age?
26/10/2016, 14:33 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea I would say so
26/10/2016, 14:33 - Cindy LEUNG: Except for last night's
26/10/2016, 14:35 - Mom: so ru feeling better now?
26/10/2016, 14:35 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea
26/10/2016, 14:36 - Cindy LEUNG: I tried to take a nap afterwards at 9
26/10/2016, 14:36 - Cindy LEUNG: And then woke up on sleeping like 6 times
26/10/2016, 14:36 - Mom: what do u mean?
26/10/2016, 14:37 - Mom: like 6 times?
26/10/2016, 14:37 - Cindy LEUNG: Like I close my eyes for a few seconds
26/10/2016, 14:37 - Cindy LEUNG: And then get nightmare again
26/10/2016, 14:37 - Cindy LEUNG: I can't remember abt what though
26/10/2016, 14:38 - Mom: u rlly have nightmares or just a feeling of having nightmare?
26/10/2016, 14:38 - Cindy LEUNG: I actually had a nightmare
26/10/2016, 14:39 - Mom: so u napped again and have nightmare again
26/10/2016, 14:39 - Mom: this scenario repeated 6 times?
26/10/2016, 15:06 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea
26/10/2016, 15:06 - Cindy LEUNG: Pretty much
26/10/2016, 15:06 - Cindy LEUNG: The situation a bit different though
26/10/2016, 15:07 - Cindy LEUNG: Because
26/10/2016, 15:07 - Cindy LEUNG: I kept thinking that stuff were happening in real life, I.e. like someone breaking in
26/10/2016, 15:07 - Mom: sigh...
26/10/2016, 15:07 - Cindy LEUNG: Oh
26/10/2016, 15:07 - Cindy LEUNG: I remember
26/10/2016, 15:08 - Cindy LEUNG: I keep thinking that I there was a cleaner who came in
26/10/2016, 15:08 - Cindy LEUNG: But we don't hv cleaners at urbanest
26/10/2016, 15:09 - Mom: so actually nobody had ever entered ur room>
26/10/2016, 15:09 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea
26/10/2016, 15:09 - Cindy LEUNG: Btw, the dividend is constant cuz it says payout ratio is the same after year 4
26/10/2016, 15:10 - Mom: ok
26/10/2016, 15:12 - Mom: these subsequent 6 times nightmare pretty much pointed to ur anxiety abt distrust abt pp around
26/10/2016, 15:16 - Cindy LEUNG: Oh well
26/10/2016, 15:16 - Cindy LEUNG: At least we identified the cause of anxiety
26/10/2016, 15:21 - Mom: hey, a very interesting question
26/10/2016, 15:22 - Mom: is the human brain a computational organ?
26/10/2016, 15:22 - Cindy LEUNG: What do you mean by computational?
26/10/2016, 15:23 - Mom: that means the brain has input from outside and generate output
26/10/2016, 15:24 - Mom: or does it generate something new and add to the info from outside?
26/10/2016, 15:24 - Mom: if yes, then how and where it create this piece of new things?
26/10/2016, 15:25 - Mom: like i always said ur brain might be able to make new connection to those fragmented memories stored in ur long-term memory
26/10/2016, 15:26 - Cindy LEUNG: I think it can create things on the inside
26/10/2016, 15:27 - Cindy LEUNG: That is creativity
26/10/2016, 15:27 - Cindy LEUNG: Or is creativity just forming new links between two random unrelated things?
26/10/2016, 15:27 - Cindy LEUNG: Then the only thing Ur brain can create is math
26/10/2016, 15:28 - Cindy LEUNG: Ok so it probably can't really create new things
26/10/2016, 15:29 - Cindy LEUNG: Like someone who never seen a banana cannot come up with the idea of a banana
26/10/2016, 15:37 - Mom: so u agree that our brain is just computational?
26/10/2016, 15:37 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea
26/10/2016, 15:38 - Cindy LEUNG: Pretty much
26/10/2016, 15:38 - Cindy LEUNG: That mean computer could one day replace human
26/10/2016, 15:38 - Cindy LEUNG: Hmmmm
26/10/2016, 15:38 - Mom: this model has already been rebutted by scientists
26/10/2016, 15:38 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea it's not very convincing
26/10/2016, 15:39 - Mom: i was watching a sci program made by bbc
26/10/2016, 15:40 - Mom: in which one school of scientists believe that our brain can create new links between info from outside
26/10/2016, 15:41 - Mom: this is so fascinating
26/10/2016, 15:42 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea but it's still between data from outside right
26/10/2016, 15:42 - Cindy LEUNG: Just the internal links r different
26/10/2016, 15:43 - Mom: not exactly
26/10/2016, 15:43 - Mom: nvm la
26/10/2016, 15:43 - Mom: if u have spare time, u can explore more of it
26/10/2016, 15:44 - Mom: but stick onto ur current studies first
26/10/2016, 15:44 - Mom: so bad u didn't do neurosci !!
26/10/2016, 15:46 - Cindy LEUNG: yea i think so too
26/10/2016, 15:46 - Cindy LEUNG: someone just texted the group cuz of font size. r they serious
26/10/2016, 15:46 - Mom: is it possible to do it at master level?
26/10/2016, 15:46 - Cindy LEUNG: just change it ur goddamn self
26/10/2016, 15:47 - Mom: what's matter with their mindset?
26/10/2016, 15:47 - Mom: nothing to do?
26/10/2016, 15:47 - Cindy LEUNG: saah
26/10/2016, 15:47 - Mom: too much time?
26/10/2016, 15:47 - Cindy LEUNG: i really feel like they have nothing to d
26/10/2016, 15:47 - Cindy LEUNG: o
26/10/2016, 15:47 - Mom: or they just want to show their presence
26/10/2016, 15:47 - Cindy LEUNG: they finished the lse100 works so fast
26/10/2016, 15:47 - Cindy LEUNG: i'm still doing my other psets
26/10/2016, 15:48 - Mom: ur group mbrs?
26/10/2016, 15:48 - Mom: wow
26/10/2016, 15:48 - Mom: so efficient
26/10/2016, 15:48 - Mom: what the hell r they?
26/10/2016, 15:48 - Mom: r they from this planet?
26/10/2016, 15:49 - Cindy LEUNG: ikr
26/10/2016, 21:36 - Cindy LEUNG: Just went to a scientific lecture abt stress given by three neurologists and a psychologist
26/10/2016, 21:37 - Cindy LEUNG: Someone from the audience asked so how do I reduce stress
26/10/2016, 21:38 - Cindy LEUNG: And they said do more exercise and get more sleep
26/10/2016, 21:38 - Cindy LEUNG: I'm like fuuuuuuck
26/10/2016, 21:39 - Cindy LEUNG: Other than that the first guy gave a sHort talk abt cortisol

28/10/2016, 07:50 - Cindy LEUNG: So I was like fuck this
28/10/2016, 07:50 - Cindy LEUNG: And I drank the emergency sake
28/10/2016, 07:50 - Cindy LEUNG: I probably only had two shots though
28/10/2016, 07:50 - Cindy LEUNG: I think I remmed less
28/10/2016, 07:51 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz I literally cannot remember a dream
28/10/2016, 07:51 - Mom: so u think u had much better sleep after drinking?
28/10/2016, 07:51 - Cindy LEUNG: Not exactly
28/10/2016, 07:51 - Cindy LEUNG: Its just more peaceful
28/10/2016, 07:51 - Mom: no nightmare rite?

28/10/2016, 07:52 - Cindy LEUNG: But now I'm really damn tired
28/10/2016, 07:52 - Cindy LEUNG: As in normal person tired
28/10/2016, 07:52 - Cindy LEUNG: I feel like a rock
28/10/2016, 07:52 - Cindy LEUNG: Usually
28/10/2016, 07:53 - Cindy LEUNG: I wake up feeling really refreshed
28/10/2016, 07:53 - Cindy LEUNG: And then a few hrs later I feel like I want to die
28/10/2016, 07:53 - Mom: but now ur tired and not refreshed
28/10/2016, 07:53 - Cindy LEUNG: Well lack of rem makes u feel like u wanna die basically
28/10/2016, 07:54 - Mom: so rem is good?
28/10/2016, 07:54 - Cindy LEUNG: I dunno
28/10/2016, 07:54 - Mom: anyway, go take a shower to see u can wake up
28/10/2016, 07:54 - Cindy LEUNG: Which is worse
28/10/2016, 07:54 - Cindy LEUNG: Im already having breakfast
28/10/2016, 07:55 - Mom: shower is even worse?
28/10/2016, 07:55 - Cindy LEUNG: No rem or nrem
28/10/2016, 07:55 - Mom: yea
28/10/2016, 07:55 - Mom: its obvious that rem helps ur brain rest
28/10/2016, 07:55 - Cindy LEUNG: With either I still cannot sustain extended sleep
28/10/2016, 07:56 - Mom: and repair the brain cell
28/10/2016, 07:56 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz I woke up at 5:30 this morning
28/10/2016, 07:56 - Mom: 2 - 5:30 am
28/10/2016, 07:56 - Mom: omg
28/10/2016, 07:56 - Mom: even after drinking alcohol?
28/10/2016, 07:56 - Cindy LEUNG: And then I had a few mini naps
28/10/2016, 07:56 - Mom: this is rlly not acceptable
28/10/2016, 07:57 - Mom: so u just slept for 3 and 1/2 hrs last night including having a nightmare
28/10/2016, 07:58 - Mom: did u wake up from the nightmare?
28/10/2016, 07:58 - Cindy LEUNG: Only the first time
28/10/2016, 07:58 - Cindy LEUNG: I slept a few times before 2am as well
28/10/2016, 07:59 - Cindy LEUNG: Probably like 4 - 4.5 hr in total
28/10/2016, 07:59 - Cindy LEUNG: I can't seem to extend the sleeping hrs
28/10/2016, 07:59 - Cindy LEUNG: Nothing works in that aspect
28/10/2016, 07:59 - Mom: sigh...
28/10/2016, 07:59 - Cindy LEUNG: Even the benzos are short acting
28/10/2016, 07:59 - Cindy LEUNG: They last abt 3-4hrs
28/10/2016, 08:00 - Mom: sigh....
28/10/2016, 08:00 - Cindy LEUNG: I need to try different drug or something
28/10/2016, 08:00 - Mom: sigh
28/10/2016, 08:01 - Cindy LEUNG: I know alcohol and benzos r chemically similar and they seem to be effective in bringing back some been so that's good
28/10/2016, 08:01 - Cindy LEUNG: Some nrem
28/10/2016, 08:02 - Mom: watch out for the quantity of alcohol consumed, u know it hurts ur liver
28/10/2016, 08:03 - Cindy LEUNG: One shot every other night should be ok
28/10/2016, 08:03 - Cindy LEUNG: Its not a lot.
28/10/2016, 08:03 - Mom: i think it's better to restrict it to 2 - 3 times a week
28/10/2016, 08:04 - Mom: only
28/10/2016, 08:04 - Cindy LEUNG: Well they're not benzos so I think it's fine.
28/10/2016, 08:04 - Cindy LEUNG: But ok
28/10/2016, 08:04 - Mom: sigh
28/10/2016, 08:04 - Mom: kk
28/10/2016, 08:04 - Cindy LEUNG: I just think of it as medicine
28/10/2016, 08:05 - Cindy LEUNG: Secondly
28/10/2016, 08:05 - Mom: hahaha
28/10/2016, 08:05 - Cindy LEUNG: I think the early waking
28/10/2016, 08:05 - Cindy LEUNG: Has to do with body temp
28/10/2016, 08:06 - Cindy LEUNG: I think they're called heat flushes
28/10/2016, 08:06 - Cindy LEUNG: I suspect thatsy hormone related
28/10/2016, 08:06 - Mom: heat flushes? do u mean those related to menstrual cycle
28/10/2016, 08:06 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea
28/10/2016, 08:07 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz my menstrual has returned to abnormal state
28/10/2016, 08:07 - Mom: did u sweat at mid-night wake up?
28/10/2016, 08:08 - Cindy LEUNG: Erm no night sweats, but I get really really hot internally
28/10/2016, 08:08 - Cindy LEUNG: Like theres a fire
28/10/2016, 08:08 - Cindy LEUNG: So I have to kick off the duvet
28/10/2016, 08:08 - Cindy LEUNG: And it still doesn't really work cuz the mattress is hot too
28/10/2016, 08:10 - Cindy LEUNG: Ok not sure if they're hot flashes noe
28/10/2016, 08:10 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz I don't sweat
28/10/2016, 08:12 - Mom: according to the chinese medicine, ur lung is most active durin 3 - 5 am, that hot and dirt will be expel through ur lung out
28/10/2016, 08:12 - Mom: this is why ppl turn so hot at the back around 3 - 5 am
28/10/2016, 08:12 - Cindy LEUNG: What does that mean in drug terms
28/10/2016, 08:13 - Mom: ur mattress ofc will turn hot as well before they're mostly not properly ventilated
28/10/2016, 08:14 - Mom: those chinese herbs will help ppl get rid of the dirt in a less vigorous way
28/10/2016, 08:14 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea but what sort of herbs r they
28/10/2016, 08:14 - Mom: so u won't feel extreme hot and be awaken during mid-night
28/10/2016, 08:15 - Cindy LEUNG: Sometimes u can get the key ingredient in pill/ supplement form
28/10/2016, 08:15 - Mom: not particularly one or two herbs, they're a combination
28/10/2016, 08:15 - Mom: chinese med doesn't work like this
28/10/2016, 08:15 - Cindy LEUNG: Well dong quai is sort of like that
28/10/2016, 08:16 - Mom: there's usually a combination of 16-20 types of herbs in one prescription
28/10/2016, 08:16 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea but I think some of them r like base
28/10/2016, 08:16 - Mom: what's dong quai? i dunn
28/10/2016, 08:16 - Mom: dunno
28/10/2016, 08:16 - Cindy LEUNG: For female hormone regulation
28/10/2016, 08:17 - Cindy LEUNG: U can buy dong quai pills herr
28/10/2016, 08:17 - Cindy LEUNG: Here
28/10/2016, 08:17 - Mom: every one type of chinese herb has its usage
28/10/2016, 08:18 - Cindy LEUNG: Hmm ok
28/10/2016, 08:18 - Mom: and that kind of usage will also depend on how they're mixed with other herbs
28/10/2016, 08:18 - Mom: different mix and amount produce different effect : some might be good, some might turn out to be srsly bad
28/10/2016, 08:18 - Cindy LEUNG: I just feel fatigue right now
28/10/2016, 08:18 - Mom: sure la
28/10/2016, 08:19 - Mom: that's the effect of alcohol
28/10/2016, 08:19 - Cindy LEUNG: I used to go to school like this.
28/10/2016, 08:19 - Cindy LEUNG: No
28/10/2016, 08:19 - Cindy LEUNG: I didn't even drink a lot.
28/10/2016, 08:19 - Cindy LEUNG: Well I guess Ur right
28/10/2016, 08:19 - Mom: if u drank a lot, i don't think u wud wake up so early
28/10/2016, 08:20 - Cindy LEUNG: I drank last year and woke up at abt the same time.
28/10/2016, 08:20 - Mom: a lot?
28/10/2016, 08:20 - Cindy LEUNG: Ofc more than yesterday
28/10/2016, 08:21 - Cindy LEUNG: I literally had like two sips and then went to bed.
28/10/2016, 08:21 - Mom: not drunk
28/10/2016, 08:21 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz I didn't want to get another nightmare
28/10/2016, 08:22 - Mom: what's in ur nightmare? being attacked or stabbed again?
28/10/2016, 08:22 - Cindy LEUNG: This guy in a green hoodie
28/10/2016, 08:22 - Cindy LEUNG: He can shoot people with his hand
28/10/2016, 08:22 - Cindy LEUNG: He shot this fat boy
28/10/2016, 08:23 - Cindy LEUNG: Abd the I saw how this bullet went through his brain
28/10/2016, 08:23 - Cindy LEUNG: Kind of looked like a fast acting cancer
28/10/2016, 08:23 - Cindy LEUNG: Which detached the brain from the lining
28/10/2016, 08:24 - Cindy LEUNG: And then his head exploded and he died
28/10/2016, 08:24 - Cindy LEUNG: Its like a bio bullet
28/10/2016, 08:24 - Mom: this is so horrible
28/10/2016, 08:24 - Cindy LEUNG: And then I spent the rest of the dream running from the guy
28/10/2016, 08:24 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz I was afraid he'd shoot me.
28/10/2016, 08:25 - Mom: this is typical anxiety
28/10/2016, 08:25 - Mom: running away from threats
28/10/2016, 08:25 - Cindy LEUNG: Well
28/10/2016, 08:25 - Cindy LEUNG: Eventually I made a mistake and ran into him
28/10/2016, 08:25 - Cindy LEUNG: Like u said it was really horrible
28/10/2016, 08:25 - Cindy LEUNG: So I woke up by will
28/10/2016, 08:26 - Cindy LEUNG: Which I don't think is actually good for u
28/10/2016, 08:26 - Mom: anxiety, anxiety, anxiety
28/10/2016, 08:26 - Mom: like i ran away from dogs
28/10/2016, 08:26 - Cindy LEUNG: Basically it puts me into a state of so before I can wake up fully
28/10/2016, 08:27 - Cindy LEUNG: State of sleep paralysis
28/10/2016, 08:27 - Mom: so u got sp?
28/10/2016, 08:27 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea ofc
28/10/2016, 08:27 - Mom: last night?
28/10/2016, 08:27 - Mom: sigh....
28/10/2016, 08:27 - Cindy LEUNG: I always get sp on wskibg
28/10/2016, 08:27 - Cindy LEUNG: Waking
28/10/2016, 08:27 - Cindy LEUNG: I think it's sleep induced
28/10/2016, 08:28 - Mom: becos of those nightmare or bad dreams?
28/10/2016, 08:28 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz I'm not supposed to wake up
28/10/2016, 08:28 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz in scared in those dreams and i know it's a dream so I tried to wake up
28/10/2016, 08:28 - Mom: ofc, ur not supposed to wake up but u chose to wake up immediately
28/10/2016, 08:29 - Cindy LEUNG: And I learnt to wake up by will
28/10/2016, 08:29 - Cindy LEUNG: So I think I induce a state of sp
28/10/2016, 08:29 - Mom: did u ever flee to other scene from those nightmare?
28/10/2016, 08:30 - Cindy LEUNG: No theres no escape if I needed to wake up
28/10/2016, 08:30 - Mom: ar...
28/10/2016, 08:30 - Mom: i think it's the way how u find ur wayout
28/10/2016, 08:31 - Mom: to me, i try to change the scene to other places where that horror didn't exist
28/10/2016, 08:31 - Mom: but u chose to wake urself up
28/10/2016, 08:33 - Cindy LEUNG: Hmm I tried before
28/10/2016, 08:33 - Mom: didn't work?
28/10/2016, 08:33 - Cindy LEUNG: But my settings r quite rational
28/10/2016, 08:33 - Cindy LEUNG: Like I tried to fly up
28/10/2016, 08:33 - Cindy LEUNG: And it doesn't work
28/10/2016, 08:33 - Cindy LEUNG: I actually fell down more when u tries to fly up
28/10/2016, 08:34 - Mom: hmmm
28/10/2016, 08:35 - Mom: time to school now?
28/10/2016, 08:40 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea I'd like to sit in my room and go through a long lost of drugs
28/10/2016, 08:40 - Cindy LEUNG: But time for macro
28/10/2016, 08:41 - Mom: get up and walk out of ur room to see if u can wake up?
28/10/2016, 08:41 - Cindy LEUNG: Should be easier to keep alertness I think
28/10/2016, 08:41 - Mom: yea
28/10/2016, 08:42 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz this is normal tiredness
28/10/2016, 08:42 - Mom: even if u sleep in the lib is better to sit inside ur room which i sometimes think is like a cell
28/10/2016, 08:42 - Mom: getting ppl depressed
28/10/2016, 08:43 - Cindy LEUNG: Um not depressed
28/10/2016, 08:43 - Mom: ok
28/10/2016, 08:43 - Mom: good
28/10/2016, 08:43 - Mom: i'm not saying ur depressed, it's ur room setting which is so cool
28/10/2016, 08:44 - Cindy LEUNG: Though I do actually suspect I hace a viral infection which cause my brain to rewire
28/10/2016, 08:44 - Mom: don't think so
28/10/2016, 08:45 - Mom: if u had a viral infection, the situation wud be much more severe, i guess
28/10/2016, 08:45 - Mom: but i dunno what actually contribute to ur condition now
28/10/2016, 08:45 - Mom: still trying to figure it out
28/10/2016, 08:45 - Cindy LEUNG: Or it maybe the sugar
28/10/2016, 08:45 - Mom: hmmm
28/10/2016, 08:46 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz I think stress only puts u in a vulnerable position
28/10/2016, 08:46 - Mom: tbh, u shud have type ii diabetics if sugar is the cause
28/10/2016, 08:46 - Cindy LEUNG: Like it can't kill u directly on its oiwb
28/10/2016, 08:46 - Cindy LEUNG: Yah u hv a point there too

28/10/2016, 08:47 - Mom: i wud def find it out
28/10/2016, 11:13 - Cindy LEUNG: Crap
28/10/2016, 11:13 - Cindy LEUNG: I was ok in econ
28/10/2016, 11:14 - Cindy LEUNG: And then I started dying halfway cuz it was too passive
28/10/2016, 11:14 - Cindy LEUNG: And then I just slept through finance
28/10/2016, 11:23 - Cindy LEUNG: By dying I mean I saw my notes turn green like halfway through econ
28/10/2016, 11:25 - Cindy LEUNG: And that was when I felt really sleepy
28/10/2016, 11:25 - Mom: üò©üò©üò©
28/10/2016, 11:27 - Mom: Ur neuro dealing with green color is on strike at that  time
28/10/2016, 11:27 - Cindy LEUNG: Ah but then I hadn't fallen asleep yet
28/10/2016, 11:27 - Cindy LEUNG: I could still follow what he was saying
28/10/2016, 11:28 - Cindy LEUNG: And then what happened next was that I started losing motor control
28/10/2016, 11:28 - Mom: If u took rest at the time u saw green text, u shud hv been recovered faster, i guess
28/10/2016, 11:29 - Mom: Is that finance follow immediately after econ?
28/10/2016, 11:29 - Cindy LEUNG: Normally if I was studying in library yeah I would take a 20 min nap
28/10/2016, 11:29 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea
28/10/2016, 11:29 - Cindy LEUNG: So after seeing green I couldn't write properly
28/10/2016, 11:30 - Mom: That 's why u were forced to sleep thro finance
28/10/2016, 11:30 - Cindy LEUNG: The green disappears after that
28/10/2016, 11:30 - Cindy LEUNG: And I just couldn't take notes
28/10/2016, 11:30 - Cindy LEUNG: Yeah I couldn't take notes in finance so I gave up and listened to her.
28/10/2016, 11:30 - Mom: Green text appearef for inly very short time rite
28/10/2016, 11:31 - Cindy LEUNG: Like 10secs-1 min
28/10/2016, 11:32 - Mom: I min is rather a long time fir seeing
28/10/2016, 11:32 - Cindy LEUNG: Yeah
28/10/2016, 11:32 - Cindy LEUNG: Its not just briefly
28/10/2016, 11:32 - Cindy LEUNG: It stays there for quite a while
28/10/2016, 11:33 - Cindy LEUNG: I tried looking at other black things as wrll
28/10/2016, 11:33 - Cindy LEUNG: But it just seems to be text and my pen
28/10/2016, 11:33 - Mom: Other than text, anything turned green?
28/10/2016, 11:33 - Cindy LEUNG: No
28/10/2016, 11:33 - Cindy LEUNG: Maybe it needs to be on white background
28/10/2016, 11:34 - Mom: So, its like u had been looking at the bright light for long time, and the shadow keep remaining in ur mind for sone time
28/10/2016, 11:35 - Cindy LEUNG: No its like the words are literally green
28/10/2016, 11:35 - Cindy LEUNG: Like I had been writing with a green pen
28/10/2016, 11:36 - Mom: I did read some online posts abt ppl seeing green text or green other things, bbut
28/10/2016, 11:37 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea I tried googling too
28/10/2016, 11:37 - Cindy LEUNG: Not too much people talk abt color vision problems
28/10/2016, 11:38 - Mom: Ttyl cuz im walking in the street

28/10/2016, 14:41 - Mom: Hello
28/10/2016, 14:42 - Mom: Still tired as hell?
28/10/2016, 14:43 - Cindy LEUNG: I'm trying to decide which dreams r rreal
28/10/2016, 14:44 - Mom: let me tell u
28/10/2016, 14:45 - Mom: no dreams r real
28/10/2016, 14:45 - Cindy LEUNG: I had a dream
28/10/2016, 14:45 - Mom: cuz they're dreams only
28/10/2016, 14:45 - Cindy LEUNG: Where I meet an invisible girl
28/10/2016, 14:45 - Cindy LEUNG: She asked me for bandaids
28/10/2016, 14:45 - Cindy LEUNG: And I was sitting on the chair
28/10/2016, 14:45 - Cindy LEUNG: In front of my desk
28/10/2016, 14:46 - Cindy LEUNG: I didn't ask if she was a ghost or not
28/10/2016, 14:46 - Mom: did u give her bandaids?
28/10/2016, 14:46 - Cindy LEUNG: So I grab my first aid box
28/10/2016, 14:46 - Cindy LEUNG: An then opened the lid
28/10/2016, 14:47 - Cindy LEUNG: And then the band aids float out
28/10/2016, 14:47 - Cindy LEUNG: And I could like still hear her talk very faintlly
28/10/2016, 14:47 - Cindy LEUNG: And the dream before that was where I was attacked by fish
28/10/2016, 14:47 - Cindy LEUNG: Like Hitchcock's the birds but with fish
28/10/2016, 14:48 - Cindy LEUNG: And then the girl knew I was attacked by fish so I talked to her.
28/10/2016, 14:48 - Mom: ask for help?
28/10/2016, 14:52 - Cindy LEUNG: What u mean
28/10/2016, 14:52 - Cindy LEUNG: NHS will think I'm insane
28/10/2016, 14:52 - Mom: sure
28/10/2016, 14:53 - Mom: i mean did u ask for help from that invisible girl?
28/10/2016, 14:54 - Mom: there's a bit unreasonable abt the details of ur dreams
28/10/2016, 14:54 - Mom: 1. u said u were attacked by the fish before seeing that invisible girl asking for help
28/10/2016, 14:55 - Mom: 2. so why that girl knew u were attacked by fish??
28/10/2016, 14:56 - Mom: 3. where's the bandaid after it floated out of the first aid box?
28/10/2016, 14:56 - Mom: 4.  what's the position at the time u woke up finally?
28/10/2016, 14:56 - Mom: so i wud guess that they were all dreams onl
28/10/2016, 15:04 - Cindy LEUNG: Ok to clarify
28/10/2016, 15:04 - Cindy LEUNG: I was attacked by fish in another drean
28/10/2016, 15:04 - Mom: yea, i got this
28/10/2016, 15:04 - Cindy LEUNG: I woke up by will from that one
28/10/2016, 15:05 - Cindy LEUNG: I vaguely remember seeing the girl in the other dream
28/10/2016, 15:05 - Cindy LEUNG: I saw the girl in my room
28/10/2016, 15:05 - Cindy LEUNG: 4 sitting in the chair
28/10/2016, 15:05 - Cindy LEUNG: 3 dunno
28/10/2016, 15:07 - Mom: so finally she didn't take the band aids
28/10/2016, 15:07 - Mom: could u still hear that girl's voice?
28/10/2016, 15:08 - Mom: and u said she knew u being attacked by fish and talked to her, did u ever try to ask her for help?
28/10/2016, 15:10 - Mom: i guess u did not woke up from dream one, u might have dream over dream
28/10/2016, 15:13 - Cindy LEUNG: No
28/10/2016, 15:13 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea i just went into a different dream
28/10/2016, 15:13 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz I was really effing tired

28/10/2016, 15:16 - Mom: do u rmb at the start of yr13 when u slept alot in class and at home, did u also have so many dreams?
28/10/2016, 16:24 - Cindy LEUNG: No I don't think so

28/10/2016, 16:25 - Cindy LEUNG: Yr13 I don't think so
28/10/2016, 16:25 - Cindy LEUNG: I started writing all of then down when I went to London, apparently that increases chnaces of remembering them
28/10/2016, 17:45 - Mom: i also think u had more dreams than before
28/10/2016, 17:45 - Mom: don't understand why

28/10/2016, 17:56 - Cindy LEUNG: and its like
28/10/2016, 17:56 - Cindy LEUNG: people have no initiative here
28/10/2016, 17:56 - Cindy LEUNG: they do stuff cuz they have to
28/10/2016, 17:56 - Cindy LEUNG: like fish in a stream
28/10/2016, 17:56 - Cindy LEUNG: u know
28/10/2016, 17:56 - Cindy LEUNG: i'm like salmon
28/10/2016, 17:56 - Cindy LEUNG: i'm retarded i swim upstream
28/10/2016, 17:57 - Mom: That's why u were attacked by fish
28/10/2016, 17:58 - Mom: Better to follow the main stream, its easier to live ur life
28/10/2016, 17:59 - Mom: Dont u know salmon die after swimming upstream and laid eggs
28/10/2016, 17:59 - Cindy LEUNG: Yep
28/10/2016, 18:00 - Cindy LEUNG: Ah I remember I read something abt salmon and their cortisol levels
28/10/2016, 18:01 - Cindy LEUNG: They go through extreme stress to get upstream
28/10/2016, 18:01 - Cindy LEUNG: That's why they die
28/10/2016, 18:05 - Cindy LEUNG: And the fish suffocated me
28/10/2016, 18:05 - Cindy LEUNG: By wrapping around my head
28/10/2016, 18:05 - Cindy LEUNG: Like they were intelligent to some degree
28/10/2016, 18:06 - Mom: Those fish in ur dream?
28/10/2016, 19:30 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea
28/10/2016, 22:28 - Cindy LEUNG: So I applied for class change and it was done so quickly
28/10/2016, 22:28 - Cindy LEUNG: They didn't even ask for med note
28/10/2016, 22:33 - Mom: Yea or not?
29/10/2016, 01:56 - Cindy LEUNG: yea i mean they changed
29/10/2016, 01:56 - Cindy LEUNG: i just said i had a sleeping problem

29/10/2016, 02:03 - Mom: what made u try?
29/10/2016, 02:03 - Cindy LEUNG: what its just an online form
29/10/2016, 02:03 - Cindy LEUNG: so i thought i submit request first
29/10/2016, 02:03 - Cindy LEUNG: and then get the med note if needed
29/10/2016, 02:05 - Mom: told u to try first long time ago to see what they actually need ma
29/10/2016, 02:05 - Mom: just woke up?
29/10/2016, 02:05 - Cindy LEUNG: yea
29/10/2016, 02:06 - Mom: i was so puzzled why u had so many bad dreams and nightmare in uk?
29/10/2016, 02:06 - Cindy LEUNG: saaa
29/10/2016, 02:06 - Cindy LEUNG: i was just thinking that
29/10/2016, 02:06 - Mom: r they medically related or just emotional response
29/10/2016, 02:07 - Cindy LEUNG: did my cataplexy originate from my hippocampus
29/10/2016, 02:07 - Mom: no
29/10/2016, 02:07 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz i got it the moment i remember the dog next door's name
29/10/2016, 02:07 - Mom: this is so weird
29/10/2016, 02:07 - Cindy LEUNG: i.e. is this all related to memory function?
29/10/2016, 02:08 - Mom: ur hippocampus is for short-tem memories
29/10/2016, 02:08 - Cindy LEUNG: hmm
29/10/2016, 02:08 - Cindy LEUNG: well
29/10/2016, 02:08 - Mom: and those memories will be transformed into long-term memories when u sleep
29/10/2016, 02:08 - Cindy LEUNG: don't exactly know how the mechanism works
29/10/2016, 02:08 - Mom: don't know
29/10/2016, 02:08 - Mom: how often do u collapse now?
29/10/2016, 02:09 - Mom: in uk
29/10/2016, 02:09 - Cindy LEUNG: like if i laugh
29/10/2016, 02:09 - Cindy LEUNG: and mild cases
29/10/2016, 02:09 - Cindy LEUNG: the same
29/10/2016, 02:09 - Mom: everything seems to relate to emotions
29/10/2016, 02:10 - Mom: do u have special feeling when u see a dog in the street now?
29/10/2016, 02:10 - Cindy LEUNG: no
29/10/2016, 02:10 - Cindy LEUNG: i never did
29/10/2016, 02:10 - Mom: have u ever been attacked or chased by dogs in ur dreams?
29/10/2016, 02:10 - Cindy LEUNG: no
29/10/2016, 02:11 - Mom: so i guess there's nothing to do with names or concrete thingy
29/10/2016, 02:11 - Cindy LEUNG: i sstill remember the dog's name
29/10/2016, 02:11 - Mom: it's just the emotion that matters
29/10/2016, 02:11 - Cindy LEUNG: do you remember that dog's name?
29/10/2016, 02:11 - Mom: no
29/10/2016, 02:11 - Mom: i never knew that dog's name
29/10/2016, 02:11 - Cindy LEUNG: charlie
29/10/2016, 02:11 - Cindy LEUNG: how can u not know
29/10/2016, 02:12 - Mom: why wud i know?
29/10/2016, 02:12 - Mom: i never heard this name
29/10/2016, 02:12 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz we saw it every morning
29/10/2016, 02:12 - Mom: i just saw him several times
29/10/2016, 02:12 - Mom: i didn't go out every morning wooo
29/10/2016, 02:13 - Mom: he scared me once when i wanted to go out and the lift came, he was in the lift looking at me so weirdly
29/10/2016, 02:14 - Mom: all i rmb is that he walked like an old man
29/10/2016, 02:18 - Cindy LEUNG: yea
29/10/2016, 02:18 - Cindy LEUNG: he was a really intelligent looking dog.
29/10/2016, 02:20 - Cindy LEUNG: wow so u can actually just study individual courses through uol
29/10/2016, 02:23 - Mom: yea, i know
29/10/2016, 02:23 - Mom: also online or distance learning
29/10/2016, 02:24 - Cindy LEUNG: shit, i feel more and more convinced that there is no point in doing a profession related undergrad unless its doctor or engineering
29/10/2016, 02:24 - Mom: what do u mean by profession related?
29/10/2016, 02:24 - Cindy LEUNG: like
29/10/2016, 02:24 - Mom: there's no such thing unless med or engrg
29/10/2016, 02:24 - Cindy LEUNG: what i mean
29/10/2016, 02:25 - Cindy LEUNG: i wouldn't do finance related stuff in undergrad
29/10/2016, 02:25 - Cindy LEUNG: or just plain management
29/10/2016, 02:25 - Cindy LEUNG: its such a waste.
29/10/2016, 02:25 - Mom: mgt is for bs only
29/10/2016, 02:26 - Cindy LEUNG: luls
29/10/2016, 02:26 - Cindy LEUNG: so i've discovered there's actually programming courses at the lse
29/10/2016, 02:26 - Mom: a&f is still uselfu, cuz u hv extra exemption papers from acca, aca when u apply for their professional mbrship
29/10/2016, 02:26 - Mom: why u discovered thing so late?
29/10/2016, 02:27 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz they''re like third year courses
29/10/2016, 02:27 - Mom: seems u never explore lse prospectus
29/10/2016, 02:27 - Cindy LEUNG: and masters
29/10/2016, 02:27 - Cindy LEUNG: well i didn't explore masters courses
29/10/2016, 02:27 - Mom: still u need pre-requisite rite?
29/10/2016, 02:27 - Cindy LEUNG: its hidden amongst the really advanced mathematics
29/10/2016, 02:27 - Cindy LEUNG: so i would have died
29/10/2016, 02:27 - Mom: nvm
29/10/2016, 02:28 - Mom: the fact is u never have thought of a career in computing, so...
29/10/2016, 02:28 - Cindy LEUNG: i guess so
29/10/2016, 02:28 - Cindy LEUNG: its like hard stuff
29/10/2016, 02:28 - Mom: and now u seems like looking for thing that suit the environment
29/10/2016, 02:29 - Cindy LEUNG: yea or statistics that stuff
29/10/2016, 02:29 - Mom: i rlly don't understand why all those sci/eng major grad take up full-time tutorial jobs??
29/10/2016, 02:29 - Cindy LEUNG: yea....
29/10/2016, 02:29 - Cindy LEUNG: strange
29/10/2016, 02:29 - Mom: i see a lot of those grad on the market
29/10/2016, 02:30 - Cindy LEUNG: maybe they are not as driven to look for job?
29/10/2016, 02:30 - Mom: is the pay of tutor rlly high or that sort of grad difficult to find a satisfactory job on the market?
29/10/2016, 02:30 - Cindy LEUNG: but imperial must have really good careers dept too
29/10/2016, 02:30 - Mom: hmmm
29/10/2016, 02:30 - Cindy LEUNG: possibly
29/10/2016, 02:30 - Cindy LEUNG: are the tutors all undergrad?
29/10/2016, 02:30 - Mom: don't think ppl never bother their career esp those from reputable unis
29/10/2016, 02:30 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz engineer u have to study until master
29/10/2016, 02:31 - Cindy LEUNG: or else ur eng degree is useless
29/10/2016, 02:31 - Mom: u know they worked very hard for a vacancy in that uni, why wud they become hea after grad?
29/10/2016, 02:31 - Cindy LEUNG: yea
29/10/2016, 02:31 - Cindy LEUNG: maybe
29/10/2016, 02:32 - Cindy LEUNG: idk i thought banks liked eng and stem people
29/10/2016, 02:32 - Mom: no, grad already usually with sci/engrg/biomed deg
29/10/2016, 02:32 - Mom: and for undergrad, ususally med students... strange
29/10/2016, 02:32 - Cindy LEUNG: oh yea
29/10/2016, 02:32 - Cindy LEUNG: maybe they have lots of free time
29/10/2016, 02:32 - Cindy LEUNG: idk
29/10/2016, 02:33 - Mom: how do u get the impression that ibanks like eng/stem ppl?
29/10/2016, 02:33 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz they always have special stem recruitment fairs

29/10/2016, 02:38 - Cindy LEUNG: that's what merill lynch told me
29/10/2016, 02:38 - Cindy LEUNG: their expectation of what counts as work exp
29/10/2016, 02:39 - Mom: merill lynch is acceptable as they expect u to do sales in the long run

29/10/2016, 02:39 - Mom: üòûüòûüòû
29/10/2016, 02:40 - Cindy LEUNG: well they turned down my app to the career event, so it must mean my cv is lacking something

29/10/2016, 02:47 - Mom: ridiculous
29/10/2016, 02:47 - Cindy LEUNG: yea they should just do a distance learning degree
29/10/2016, 02:47 - Mom: no, they shud just paid to buy a cert
29/10/2016, 02:47 - Cindy LEUNG: well ok that too
29/10/2016, 02:48 - Mom: at the end of the day, those subj taught at uni r useless
29/10/2016, 02:48 - Cindy LEUNG: which subject
29/10/2016, 02:48 - Mom: all of them
29/10/2016, 02:48 - Cindy LEUNG: well
29/10/2016, 02:48 - Mom: except med/engrg
29/10/2016, 02:48 - Cindy LEUNG: i kind of wanna just learn stuff
29/10/2016, 02:49 - Mom: u belong to the third planet
29/10/2016, 02:49 - Mom: u shud go to the sci stream for the very first day
29/10/2016, 02:49 - Cindy LEUNG: no if u sit in the cafe, u always hear the odd on or two people talking about development or history or some weird topic
29/10/2016, 02:50 - Mom: they belong to the fourth planet
29/10/2016, 02:50 - Cindy LEUNG: lol.
29/10/2016, 02:50 - Mom: like those doing arts stuff ppl
29/10/2016, 02:50 - Cindy LEUNG: oh yea those social enterprise people
29/10/2016, 02:50 - Mom: perhaps if u do history in lse, u wud be happier
29/10/2016, 02:51 - Cindy LEUNG: i agree those over-zealous liberals belong to the fourth planet
29/10/2016, 02:52 - Cindy LEUNG: yeah i think the history bunch is a bit weird
29/10/2016, 02:52 - Cindy LEUNG: i met this guy who said he fell out with his roommate cuz they had disagreements over animal rights.
29/10/2016, 02:52 - Cindy LEUNG: so i was like riiiight.
29/10/2016, 02:53 - Mom: so funny
29/10/2016, 02:53 - Cindy LEUNG: yah its kinda funny
29/10/2016, 02:53 - Mom: they have so much waste time to care abt those subtle thingy
29/10/2016, 02:54 - Cindy LEUNG: ah sometimes the data sets are quite interesting imo
29/10/2016, 02:54 - Cindy LEUNG: like we're doing economic growth atm
29/10/2016, 02:55 - Cindy LEUNG: and i would never guess that hk is more innovative than singapore
29/10/2016, 02:56 - Mom: i think both r on similar level
29/10/2016, 02:56 - Cindy LEUNG: no singapore economic growth is mainly due to capital accumulation
29/10/2016, 02:57 - Mom: i wudn't think singapore more advance cuz their govt never support out of the box thinking
29/10/2016, 02:58 - Cindy LEUNG: but their education system is supposedly better and i seems to me that their gov supports more arts and creativity stuff
29/10/2016, 02:58 - Cindy LEUNG: but maybe not
29/10/2016, 02:59 - Mom: i dunno abt arts and creativity, but ppl there r just more hardworking and they r supposed to follow the main stream
29/10/2016, 03:00 - Mom: i.e. u can't be a salmon
29/10/2016, 03:00 - Cindy LEUNG: hmm i think so
29/10/2016, 03:01 - Cindy LEUNG: hk technological progress is apparently 10 times more though
29/10/2016, 03:01 - Mom: wow
29/10/2016, 03:01 - Mom: 10 times
29/10/2016, 03:01 - Cindy LEUNG: like we're 2.x%
29/10/2016, 03:01 - Cindy LEUNG: and they're like 0.2x
29/10/2016, 03:02 - Cindy LEUNG: i'm like woe, when did we get so tech savvy.
29/10/2016, 03:02 - Mom: r they on the same baseline?
29/10/2016, 03:02 - Cindy LEUNG: yeah ofc
29/10/2016, 03:02 - Cindy LEUNG: this is based on model data
29/10/2016, 03:02 - Mom: hmm
29/10/2016, 03:03 - Mom: so which part of singaporean excel hk?
29/10/2016, 03:03 - Cindy LEUNG: er... dunno
29/10/2016, 03:03 - Cindy LEUNG: less drama?
29/10/2016, 03:04 - Cindy LEUNG: i tend to find that singaporean personality types vary more than hk people here
29/10/2016, 03:04 - Mom: hmmm
29/10/2016, 03:06 - Cindy LEUNG: and the mandos are so weird
29/10/2016, 03:06 - Mom: ur roommate?
29/10/2016, 03:06 - Cindy LEUNG: the first question they ask me is do you speak mandarin
29/10/2016, 03:06 - Cindy LEUNG: they always ask me that
29/10/2016, 03:06 - Mom: tell them to go to hell
29/10/2016, 03:06 - Cindy LEUNG: maybe its like to tell ur political position
29/10/2016, 03:07 - Mom: ask them: why the world need to speak mando?
29/10/2016, 03:07 - Mom: so annoying
29/10/2016, 03:07 - Mom: everything related to political position
29/10/2016, 03:08 - Mom: i rlly hate these over-enthusiastic "country lovers"
29/10/2016, 03:08 - Cindy LEUNG: but it can't be that every one is an enthusiatic country lover
29/10/2016, 03:08 - Mom: tell them that mando still not the official lang at lse?
29/10/2016, 03:08 - Mom: and in most of the world's reputable unis
29/10/2016, 03:09 - Cindy LEUNG: in the beginning it thought they ask me that cuz they're not good at english
29/10/2016, 03:09 - Cindy LEUNG: that's true for a lot of them -- cuz the lse basically has to prostitute out itself for funding
29/10/2016, 03:09 - Mom: have u ever, even 1 min, thought that they r china spies?
29/10/2016, 03:10 - Cindy LEUNG: but then i met a couple which spoke perfect english with no accent and they still ask me that question
29/10/2016, 03:10 - Cindy LEUNG: hmm dunno
29/10/2016, 03:10 - Mom: r the couple asian or western?
29/10/2016, 03:11 - Cindy LEUNG: by couple i meant a few mando students
29/10/2016, 03:11 - Mom: ok
29/10/2016, 03:11 - Cindy LEUNG: like they from shanghai or beijing
29/10/2016, 03:11 - Cindy LEUNG: i only met one from harbin and she was the weird one, cuz she hangs out with the japanese
29/10/2016, 03:12 - Mom: do they know ur from hong kong before asking if u can speak mando?
29/10/2016, 03:12 - Cindy LEUNG: erm yea
29/10/2016, 03:13 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz the first question is
29/10/2016, 03:13 - Cindy LEUNG: where are you from
29/10/2016, 03:13 - Cindy LEUNG: i say hk
29/10/2016, 03:13 - Cindy LEUNG: and then
29/10/2016, 03:13 - Cindy LEUNG: do you speak mandarin then
29/10/2016, 03:14 - Mom: what's their response when u say no
29/10/2016, 03:14 - Cindy LEUNG: its like they either (1) expect me to speak mando or (2) they know cantonese is the main language in hk
29/10/2016, 03:14 - Cindy LEUNG: sorry, they don't know
29/10/2016, 03:14 - Mom: u never answer that q rite?
29/10/2016, 03:14 - Cindy LEUNG: their response is like oh
29/10/2016, 03:14 - Cindy LEUNG: which question?
29/10/2016, 03:15 - Mom: mando lang?
29/10/2016, 03:15 - Cindy LEUNG: i say i speak english
29/10/2016, 03:15 - Mom: if i were u, i wud probably question them why wud i know mando?
29/10/2016, 03:15 - Mom: i'm from hk not mainland china
29/10/2016, 03:16 - Cindy LEUNG: well u don't wanna go around attacking every chinese person
29/10/2016, 03:16 - Cindy LEUNG: thats not very wise
29/10/2016, 03:16 - Cindy LEUNG: in my position as of the time being
29/10/2016, 03:16 - Mom: but that lanuage question looks a bit stupid and insulting to me
29/10/2016, 03:16 - Cindy LEUNG: next time i'll say america
29/10/2016, 03:17 - Cindy LEUNG: yea they don't even ask me, what do you study
29/10/2016, 03:17 - Cindy LEUNG: which is the normal question after where are you from
29/10/2016, 03:17 - Mom: i thought they expect every black hair, except the blacks, know mando
29/10/2016, 03:17 - Cindy LEUNG: yeah possibly
29/10/2016, 03:17 - Mom: two things : 1 they're too igorant, 2. they're arrogant
29/10/2016, 03:18 - Cindy LEUNG: i'm just wondering maybe they don't even know a lot about hong kong.
29/10/2016, 03:18 - Cindy LEUNG: dunno what censorship is like up there
29/10/2016, 03:18 - Mom: but for someone from big cities like shanghai, beijing, i guess no. 2 wud be the possible answer
29/10/2016, 03:19 - Mom: ur too igorant
29/10/2016, 03:19 - Cindy LEUNG: i tend to find beijing people less friendly than shanghai people
29/10/2016, 03:19 - Cindy LEUNG: so i would say 2 is true for beijingers
29/10/2016, 03:19 - Mom: don't u know they're very good at "climb over the wall"
29/10/2016, 03:20 - Cindy LEUNG: shanghai-ers are a bit different
29/10/2016, 03:20 - Mom: and u said they're from shanghai, beijing, which is impossible that they don't know anything abt hongkong
29/10/2016, 03:20 - Cindy LEUNG: i don't know that much about shanghai tbh
29/10/2016, 03:20 - Mom: sure, beijing ppl r the centre of china ma
29/10/2016, 03:20 - Cindy LEUNG: i only know beijing cuz i went there
29/10/2016, 03:21 - Mom: they sure know very well abt hongkong
29/10/2016, 03:21 - Mom: i mean ppl from both areas
29/10/2016, 03:21 - Cindy LEUNG: ok
29/10/2016, 03:21 - Cindy LEUNG: i overheard my flatmate's group of girlfriends chatting yesterday
29/10/2016, 03:22 - Mom: shanghai ppl r like 2nd or 3rd place successor, so they might not be that arrogant
29/10/2016, 03:22 - Cindy LEUNG: hmmm
29/10/2016, 03:22 - Mom: besides, shanghai ppl tend to be more economical, practical
29/10/2016, 03:22 - Cindy LEUNG: i think there's probably a larger international school community in shanghai
29/10/2016, 03:23 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz tehy speak better english
29/10/2016, 03:24 - Mom: sure, there're quite a no. of international organisation in shanghai offering education like esf in hk
29/10/2016, 03:24 - Cindy LEUNG: yea
29/10/2016, 03:24 - Mom: yew chung is one of them
29/10/2016, 03:25 - Cindy LEUNG: so apparently manchester is super prestigous
29/10/2016, 03:25 - Mom: becos president si went to manchester when he was in uk
29/10/2016, 03:25 - Cindy LEUNG: yeah i think so too
29/10/2016, 03:25 - Cindy LEUNG: i'm like lol
29/10/2016, 03:26 - Cindy LEUNG: it's probably as prestigious as imperial now
29/10/2016, 03:26 - Mom: looks like si wants to downgrade the importance of london in the world's position
29/10/2016, 03:26 - Mom: u never know
29/10/2016, 03:27 - Cindy LEUNG: possibly, to make banks move to china or something
29/10/2016, 03:27 - Mom: did u notice cityu of hk climbs up the ranking league table so quickly?
29/10/2016, 03:27 - Cindy LEUNG: but the uk already committed suicide so .....
29/10/2016, 03:27 - Mom: brits r so ....
29/10/2016, 03:28 - Cindy LEUNG: dude people are dumb here

29/10/2016, 03:28 - Mom: üò©üò©üò©
29/10/2016, 03:29 - Cindy LEUNG: they were stupid, they had poor schooling and then they destroy their brain by drinking massive amounts of alcohol
29/10/2016, 03:29 - Mom: üò©üò©üò©
29/10/2016, 03:29 - Mom: üòûüòûüòûüòû

29/10/2016, 10:02 - Cindy LEUNG: dream recounting again
29/10/2016, 10:03 - Cindy LEUNG: last night i was a security guard
29/10/2016, 10:03 - Cindy LEUNG: and then there was this guy with a bomb at the train station
29/10/2016, 10:04 - Cindy LEUNG: he threatened to blow up the place so we all lie down on the ground
29/10/2016, 10:04 - Cindy LEUNG: and then he pull out this random lady
29/10/2016, 10:04 - Cindy LEUNG: pulled
29/10/2016, 10:04 - Cindy LEUNG: and the lady had a giant pair of scissors, she threatened to commit suicide
29/10/2016, 10:05 - Cindy LEUNG: she was like this firm is going to die with me!!
29/10/2016, 10:06 - Cindy LEUNG: and then using the giant pair of scissors, she made two big slashes with it across her torso first.
29/10/2016, 10:08 - Cindy LEUNG: and then she opened the scissors and cut open her stomach by folding the flesh together and cutting into that
29/10/2016, 10:09 - Cindy LEUNG: there was a lot of blood.
29/10/2016, 10:09 - Cindy LEUNG: it was like scissors seppuku
29/10/2016, 11:10 - Mom: hi

30/10/2016, 05:50 - Cindy LEUNG: Fruit has high sugar content

30/10/2016, 10:10 - Cindy LEUNG: I thought it was because I was really sticky and uncomfortable
30/10/2016, 10:10 - Cindy LEUNG: But now seems like it's cuz of the temperature drop showering causes
30/10/2016, 10:10 - Cindy LEUNG: So I can fall asleep very quickly after shower
30/10/2016, 10:11 - Mom: Im saying that ur lung processes cleaning every morning around 4 am, so that's why ur body temp raise

30/10/2016, 10:19 - Mom: Cc
30/10/2016, 10:20 - Cindy LEUNG: basically, the beginning of the week (monday, tuesday, maybe wednesday) looks like that
30/10/2016, 10:21 - Cindy LEUNG: then i dunno why i get worse nightmares near the end of the week, (so wednesday night, thursday night). I get anxiety attacks and basically stay up all night after those which interrupt my schedule
30/10/2016, 10:21 - Mom: ü§îü§î
30/10/2016, 10:22 - Cindy LEUNG: then the weekend tends to be fine since i just stay at home and work on micro all day

30/10/2016, 10:23 - Cindy LEUNG: i tend to be more productive near the beginning of the week
30/10/2016, 10:23 - Mom: I share ur sadness
30/10/2016, 10:23 - Cindy LEUNG: and then by the end of the week i can't do anything, so i feel sad about it
30/10/2016, 10:23 - Cindy LEUNG: lol
30/10/2016, 10:23 - Cindy LEUNG: in terms of depressive feelings.
30/10/2016, 10:23 - Cindy LEUNG: i think friday and saturday is the worse
30/10/2016, 10:23 - Cindy LEUNG: worst
30/10/2016, 10:24 - Cindy LEUNG: i'm sure there is some explanation for this but having figured why yet
30/10/2016, 10:24 - Cindy LEUNG: like saturdays is the absolute worse, i just want everyone i see to die
30/10/2016, 10:25 - Cindy LEUNG: lulz

30/10/2016, 14:02 - Cindy LEUNG: alright
30/10/2016, 14:02 - Cindy LEUNG: i just had a really weird dream sitting at the my desk
30/10/2016, 14:02 - Cindy LEUNG: i dunno why i keep suddenly falling asleep today
30/10/2016, 14:03 - Cindy LEUNG: but i thought i was attached to a game console
30/10/2016, 14:03 - Cindy LEUNG: and that there was another computer on my desk
30/10/2016, 14:03 - Cindy LEUNG: and then there was a moment i actually opened my eyes for a bit
30/10/2016, 14:03 - Cindy LEUNG: so i tried to see if there was a computer
30/10/2016, 14:04 - Cindy LEUNG: all i saw was my game theory book
30/10/2016, 14:04 - Cindy LEUNG: but i could feel the computer cuz i was grabbing onto it
30/10/2016, 14:05 - Cindy LEUNG: the game i was playing was like pokemon except u controlled this giant turtle
30/10/2016, 14:05 - Cindy LEUNG: and the turtle was real
30/10/2016, 14:05 - Cindy LEUNG: and it kept biting my arm dunno why
30/10/2016, 14:06 - Cindy LEUNG: and then u would see the physical damages on the turtle
30/10/2016, 14:06 - Cindy LEUNG: it was terrible
30/10/2016, 14:06 - Cindy LEUNG: there was this bit were the opponent pull out the jaw of the tutrlte
30/10/2016, 14:06 - Mom: why the turtle was damaged, it even bit u
30/10/2016, 14:07 - Cindy LEUNG: like
30/10/2016, 14:07 - Cindy LEUNG: it felt like it was sucking on my arm
30/10/2016, 14:07 - Cindy LEUNG: the actual sensation was like having something wrapped around your arm like and arm band
30/10/2016, 14:08 - Cindy LEUNG: i can actually still feel it
30/10/2016, 14:09 - Mom: i mean how the turtle got damaged? who hurt that turtle
30/10/2016, 14:09 - Cindy LEUNG: oh
30/10/2016, 14:09 - Cindy LEUNG: like it was supposed to fight other animals
30/10/2016, 14:09 - Cindy LEUNG: like pokemon
30/10/2016, 14:10 - Cindy LEUNG: and this was some sort of video game which i was connected to on the computer.
30/10/2016, 14:10 - Cindy LEUNG: this is computer no.2
30/10/2016, 14:10 - Cindy LEUNG: i was aware that there was a second computer on my desk
30/10/2016, 14:11 - Cindy LEUNG: it kind of looked like it was made out of a dominoes pizza box
30/10/2016, 14:11 - Cindy LEUNG: it was kind of retro looking, its a computer but so many parts were made from paper.
30/10/2016, 14:13 - Cindy LEUNG: like if u imagine a very old computer which operated mainly mechanically -- had wire arms controlling a pencil which would write out words on a sheet of paper to print stuff
30/10/2016, 14:13 - Cindy LEUNG: yep u can play games on that thing
30/10/2016, 14:14 - Cindy LEUNG: and it took voice control, after i opened my eyes and saw that there was no computer on my desk
30/10/2016, 14:14 - Cindy LEUNG: so i kept trying commands like escape, return, back
30/10/2016, 14:15 - Mom: Ofc yhere shudnt be computer on ur desk cuz u said u were reading game theory
30/10/2016, 14:16 - Cindy LEUNG: its kind of like i was connected to a terminal to another reality space.
30/10/2016, 14:16 - Mom: U felt so
30/10/2016, 14:16 - Cindy LEUNG: yeaaa
30/10/2016, 14:16 - Mom: Strange
30/10/2016, 14:16 - Cindy LEUNG: creepy
30/10/2016, 14:17 - Mom: U thought u had break into the 4th space?
30/10/2016, 14:17 - Cindy LEUNG: what do you mean by 4th space
30/10/2016, 14:18 - Mom: I mean another planet or world
30/10/2016, 14:18 - Cindy LEUNG: well its a video game
30/10/2016, 14:18 - Cindy LEUNG: and i knew it was a video game, like a VR game
30/10/2016, 14:18 - Cindy LEUNG: so its not exactly another world.
30/10/2016, 14:19 - Cindy LEUNG: i didn't feel like i found another world, but that i was stuck inside a game.
30/10/2016, 14:19 - Mom: So that're things happened in ur brain only
30/10/2016, 14:19 - Cindy LEUNG: yeaaaah
30/10/2016, 14:20 - Cindy LEUNG: but i coudl feel stuff
30/10/2016, 14:20 - Cindy LEUNG: which means that i hallucinate sensory elements when i sleep
30/10/2016, 14:20 - Cindy LEUNG: /dream
30/10/2016, 14:20 - Cindy LEUNG: i can only see objects through my mind
30/10/2016, 14:21 - Cindy LEUNG: when my mind is closed
30/10/2016, 14:21 - Cindy LEUNG: when my eyes are closed
30/10/2016, 14:23 - Mom: ru sure u def fee the touch of things inside the game?
30/10/2016, 14:23 - Cindy LEUNG: yaah
30/10/2016, 14:24 - Mom: sorry, what have u done in the video game?
30/10/2016, 14:24 - Mom: controlling the turtle?
30/10/2016, 14:24 - Cindy LEUNG: like rescue the turtle
30/10/2016, 14:24 - Cindy LEUNG: and then we trekked across snowy plane.
30/10/2016, 14:24 - Cindy LEUNG: snowylands
30/10/2016, 14:25 - Cindy LEUNG: and then we fought some other animal
30/10/2016, 14:25 - Cindy LEUNG: and that thing beat it
30/10/2016, 14:25 - Cindy LEUNG: so i had to rescue the turtle again
30/10/2016, 14:26 - Mom: looks like u were the main character of the video game
30/10/2016, 14:26 - Cindy LEUNG: dude i don't even know what game it was
30/10/2016, 14:26 - Cindy LEUNG: i just know that it would deefinitely be banned cuz of animal cruelty
30/10/2016, 14:27 - Mom: but u did have played some video game abt fight different levels
30/10/2016, 14:27 - Cindy LEUNG: sort of
30/10/2016, 14:27 - Cindy LEUNG: not really.
30/10/2016, 14:29 - Mom: u had this experience of fighting a video game and then ur brain creates new content of the game, isn't this reasonable?
30/10/2016, 14:29 - Mom: but ur sensation is kind of difficult to explain
30/10/2016, 14:29 - Cindy LEUNG: yea if u want to explain the story
30/10/2016, 14:30 - Cindy LEUNG: i never been outside of the game before though
30/10/2016, 14:30 - Mom: where's ur laptop when u were napping at the desk?
30/10/2016, 14:31 - Cindy LEUNG: on the stand
30/10/2016, 14:31 - Mom: so u were working on the computer, isn't it?
30/10/2016, 14:32 - Cindy LEUNG: no im doing game theory
30/10/2016, 14:32 - Cindy LEUNG: its paperwork
30/10/2016, 14:32 - Mom: ok
30/10/2016, 14:33 - Mom: interesting
30/10/2016, 14:34 - Mom: how do u feel when u woke up from that dream?
30/10/2016, 14:34 - Mom: anxiety or scary
30/10/2016, 14:34 - Cindy LEUNG: erm like strange
30/10/2016, 14:34 - Cindy LEUNG: maybe a bit of anxiety
30/10/2016, 14:34 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz i didn't want to continue playing that game
30/10/2016, 14:35 - Mom: relax, its just dream
30/10/2016, 14:35 - Mom: won't hurt u in the end
30/10/2016, 14:36 - Cindy LEUNG: but i didn't want to continue cuz i had to do my game theory stuff
30/10/2016, 14:36 - Cindy LEUNG: and it was kind of difficult to get out of the game
30/10/2016, 14:36 - Mom: get up and do pilates
30/10/2016, 14:37 - Mom: or do hopping 30 times
30/10/2016, 14:37 - Cindy LEUNG: fuck this shit is so hard
30/10/2016, 14:38 - Cindy LEUNG: so my senpai told me that the games were hard and the lecturer is shit
30/10/2016, 14:38 - Mom: u said u wanna get rid of that feeling then u got to do some other distracting things
30/10/2016, 14:38 - Cindy LEUNG: yeah i now i know
30/10/2016, 14:38 - Mom: u never go to that lecture?
30/10/2016, 14:39 - Cindy LEUNG: no i do
30/10/2016, 14:39 - Mom: why won't know lecturer good or bad?
30/10/2016, 14:39 - Cindy LEUNG: but we just started the games
30/10/2016, 14:39 - Cindy LEUNG: he's okay in the beginning
30/10/2016, 14:39 - Cindy LEUNG: and then we get to the games
30/10/2016, 14:40 - Cindy LEUNG: and then it's like a,b,c in the lecture
30/10/2016, 14:40 - Cindy LEUNG: and then when u get back and do the exercises, they ask you to spell alligator in french
30/10/2016, 14:41 - Cindy LEUNG: omg
30/10/2016, 14:42 - Mom: this is rather ridicious
30/10/2016, 14:42 - Cindy LEUNG: u don't say
30/10/2016, 14:42 - Cindy LEUNG: now i needa battle with 20 kids to learn how to do this in office hours
30/10/2016, 14:43 - Mom: ur rather stressed cuz i always saw u write with "battle"
30/10/2016, 14:43 - Cindy LEUNG: yes that is an accurate statement
30/10/2016, 14:44 - Cindy LEUNG: the lesson at the end of the day is to always listen to senpai
30/10/2016, 14:45 - Mom: ok
30/10/2016, 14:45 - Mom: at least u got good senpai
30/10/2016, 14:45 - Mom: they're willing to give advice
30/10/2016, 14:45 - Cindy LEUNG: huh
30/10/2016, 14:45 - Cindy LEUNG: only cuz i'm annoying and i pester them
30/10/2016, 14:45 - Cindy LEUNG: even i find myself annoying
30/10/2016, 14:46 - Mom: to be a successful businessman, u got to know when u have to insist
30/10/2016, 14:47 - Mom: with a clear objective
30/10/2016, 14:47 - Cindy LEUNG: well yeah that's right
30/10/2016, 14:48 - Cindy LEUNG: i'm getting really stressed... :(
30/10/2016, 14:49 - Mom: take it easy
30/10/2016, 14:49 - Mom: eat some cup noodle
30/10/2016, 14:50 - Cindy LEUNG: i give up with the games
30/10/2016, 14:50 - Mom: no, don't give up ur game theory
30/10/2016, 14:51 - Cindy LEUNG: i gotta do other things as well
30/10/2016, 14:51 - Mom: ok
30/10/2016, 14:51 - Mom: perhaps it's better to do other stuff to balance ur emotion
30/10/2016, 14:51 - Cindy LEUNG: how do i determine how long i should spend agonizing over a task before giving up
30/10/2016, 14:51 - Mom: or stress
30/10/2016, 14:52 - Mom: when u got nothing out of ur present work, better stop for some time
30/10/2016, 14:52 - Mom: and change to do other things
30/10/2016, 14:53 - Cindy LEUNG: so like how much time
30/10/2016, 14:53 - Cindy LEUNG: i need a quantity
30/10/2016, 14:53 - Cindy LEUNG: i spent the whole morning on it
30/10/2016, 14:53 - Cindy LEUNG: i don't think that's right
30/10/2016, 14:53 - Mom: when u thought no more productivity
30/10/2016, 14:54 - Mom: max 3 hrs
30/10/2016, 14:54 - Cindy LEUNG: ok
30/10/2016, 14:54 - Cindy LEUNG: that sounds reasonable
30/10/2016, 14:54 - Mom: 2 - 3 is enough for one job
30/10/2016, 14:54 - Cindy LEUNG: so my advisor told me to write subtasks
30/10/2016, 14:54 - Cindy LEUNG: i've done that
30/10/2016, 14:54 - Mom: then ur productivity wud be keep at high level
30/10/2016, 14:54 - Mom: what subtasks?
30/10/2016, 14:55 - Cindy LEUNG: like i have a sheet of paper with what to do for each course
30/10/2016, 14:55 - Mom: wow, he has nothing to do?
30/10/2016, 14:55 - Mom: so many trivial works
30/10/2016, 14:55 - Cindy LEUNG: ....
30/10/2016, 14:55 - Cindy LEUNG: no i asked him about managing stress during the last meeting
30/10/2016, 14:56 - Mom: oh
30/10/2016, 14:56 - Mom: r these additional works which make u more stress
30/10/2016, 14:56 - Cindy LEUNG: i think it's helped a bit
30/10/2016, 14:57 - Mom: i think his objective is to let u divide ur work into smaller pieces, so that u can deal with them one by one in ean easier way
30/10/2016, 14:57 - Cindy LEUNG: no what i do is just write down what i have to do for
30/10/2016, 14:57 - Cindy LEUNG: every course
30/10/2016, 14:57 - Cindy LEUNG: like a homework log
30/10/2016, 14:57 - Mom: so u thought it's helpful?
30/10/2016, 14:58 - Cindy LEUNG: all my work skills have disappeared post ib
30/10/2016, 14:58 - Mom: maybe he's trying to help u better organise ur things
30/10/2016, 14:58 - Cindy LEUNG: yea
30/10/2016, 14:59 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz i used to freak out over three tasks
30/10/2016, 14:59 - Mom: ur skills didn't go away
30/10/2016, 14:59 - Mom: just ur confidence fade
30/10/2016, 14:59 - Cindy LEUNG: or more like, i need someone just to tell me what to do
30/10/2016, 14:59 - Mom: becos of ur illness
30/10/2016, 14:59 - Mom: yea
30/10/2016, 14:59 - Mom: u need direction
30/10/2016, 15:00 - Mom: but if u think he can provide direction, then it's good
30/10/2016, 15:00 - Cindy LEUNG: i can't decide things either
30/10/2016, 15:00 - Mom: cuz u wudn't need to bother whether ur doing things right or wrong
30/10/2016, 15:00 - Mom: tru that
30/10/2016, 15:00 - Cindy LEUNG: i stood in front of the sushi rack in wasabi for like 10 mins yesterday
30/10/2016, 15:01 - Mom: why?
30/10/2016, 15:01 - Mom: can't decide which one to buy?
30/10/2016, 15:01 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz i can't decide which one to buy
30/10/2016, 15:01 - Mom: wth
30/10/2016, 15:01 - Mom: omg

31/10/2016, 10:26 - Mom: can't say too much
31/10/2016, 10:26 - Mom: ur working is rather reasonable
31/10/2016, 10:26 - Mom: all i can say is that the food in london is too expensive
31/10/2016, 10:27 - Cindy LEUNG: Hmm yea

31/10/2016, 10:31 - Mom: Is this too expensive?
31/10/2016, 10:31 - Cindy LEUNG: Usually it's about ¬£5 but I over estimated
31/10/2016, 10:31 - Mom: but u just eat 4 meals each week?
31/10/2016, 10:32 - Cindy LEUNG: No this is outside food
31/10/2016, 10:32 - Mom: ¬£5 seems more reasonable
31/10/2016, 10:32 - Mom: so u mainly eat outside?
31/10/2016, 10:32 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea cuz I'm mostly on campus
31/10/2016, 10:33 - Cindy LEUNG: So lunch is outside
31/10/2016, 10:33 - Mom: then, that's the reasonable spending
31/10/2016, 10:33 - Mom: if u mostly stay outside
31/10/2016, 10:33 - Cindy LEUNG: ‚òπ
31/10/2016, 10:36 - Mom: ¬£230*38 + ¬£500*8 + ¬£18000 = ¬£30740
31/10/2016, 10:36 - Mom: approx total for the whole yr
31/10/2016, 10:37 - Mom: plus 10% ~ ¬£3000
31/10/2016, 10:37 - Cindy LEUNG: isn't isn't it 9 months?
31/10/2016, 10:37 - Cindy LEUNG: whats 10% for ?
31/10/2016, 10:38 - Mom: 8 months
31/10/2016, 10:38 - Mom: u see 38 weeks for dorm and 8 months for food
31/10/2016, 10:38 - Mom: 10% is the contingency money
31/10/2016, 10:38 - Mom: or pocket money
31/10/2016, 10:38 - Cindy LEUNG: i see
31/10/2016, 10:39 - Mom: so total roughly equals to 35k
31/10/2016, 10:39 - Cindy LEUNG: wow
31/10/2016, 10:39 - Mom: this is still acceptable
31/10/2016, 10:39 - Mom: this yr exchange rate is 9.5 which is good
31/10/2016, 10:39 - Cindy LEUNG: lulz
31/10/2016, 10:39 - Mom: but mine is around 10.6
31/10/2016, 10:40 - Mom: cuz i bought it last yr
31/10/2016, 10:40 - Cindy LEUNG: too bad.
31/10/2016, 10:41 - Mom: some ppl even bought pounds for total 3 yrs for their kids long time age
31/10/2016, 10:41 - Cindy LEUNG: why
31/10/2016, 10:41 - Mom: becoz i dunno
31/10/2016, 10:41 - Cindy LEUNG: buying one year before is understandable
31/10/2016, 10:41 - Cindy LEUNG: but buying all in three years is kind of dumb
31/10/2016, 10:42 - Cindy LEUNG: unless u can buy for cheaper.
31/10/2016, 10:42 - Mom: no one wud assume that brexits happened rite?
31/10/2016, 10:43 - Mom: ppl used to buy forex as they need
31/10/2016, 10:43 - Cindy LEUNG: tjat
31/10/2016, 10:44 - Mom: if they thought they need pounds in a foreseeable future, then it's reasonable to buy it regularly at constant price
31/10/2016, 10:44 - Mom: i recalled that the amount of total money spent last yr is abt 35k also
31/10/2016, 10:45 - Cindy LEUNG: yea but last year i bought a lot of random crap
31/10/2016, 10:46 - Cindy LEUNG: hey u've given me 16k so far right?

31/10/2016, 10:52 - Mom: i still have 9k in my ac
31/10/2016, 10:53 - Cindy LEUNG: üò∞
31/10/2016, 10:53 - Mom: there're still 2 installments school fees + remaining bal of dorm fees
31/10/2016, 10:54 - Mom: at least 16.6k still needed
31/10/2016, 10:54 - Mom: shud be fine, i guess
31/10/2016, 10:55 - Cindy LEUNG: .....
31/10/2016, 10:55 - Cindy LEUNG: so if budget is 35k
31/10/2016, 10:55 - Cindy LEUNG: that's 18.6k for 38 weeks
31/10/2016, 10:56 - Cindy LEUNG: so about 2300 per month
31/10/2016, 10:56 - Cindy LEUNG: ???
31/10/2016, 10:56 - Mom: 18.6k incl?

31/10/2016, 10:59 - Mom: i paid u 22.5k and u have 10.3
31/10/2016, 11:00 - Mom: this means u spent 12.2 on 1/3 of skl fee + 18 wk dorm
31/10/2016, 11:00 - Cindy LEUNG: so there's 15k for 7 months left
31/10/2016, 11:00 - Mom: and the living exps for first 6-7wks
31/10/2016, 11:01 - Mom: 35k - 12.2k = 22.8k for the rest
31/10/2016, 11:01 - Cindy LEUNG: wait wat
31/10/2016, 11:01 - Cindy LEUNG: i thought u said u have 9k left
31/10/2016, 11:01 - Cindy LEUNG: so 22k + 9k is 31k
31/10/2016, 11:02 - Mom: taking out 16.6k (12k+4.6), u still have 6.2 for remaining 32 wks
31/10/2016, 11:03 - Mom: so u'll have roughly 190 for every wk
31/10/2016, 11:03 - Mom: i didn't buy all 35k in advance
31/10/2016, 11:04 - Mom: ¬£190 per week is far too generous

31/10/2016, 12:15 - Cindy LEUNG: i think my face looks less yellow today.
31/10/2016, 12:16 - Mom: Rlly
31/10/2016, 12:16 - Mom: Is that safe?
31/10/2016, 12:16 - Mom: Those supplements?
31/10/2016, 12:17 - Cindy LEUNG: i bought the one from thorne research
31/10/2016, 12:17 - Cindy LEUNG: the ingredients are a bunch of herbs
31/10/2016, 12:17 - Mom: K
31/10/2016, 12:17 - Cindy LEUNG: i think similar to chinese medicinal herbs, cuz i opened a cap and it was realy bitter
31/10/2016, 12:19 - Mom: but always watch for the side effect cuz i know there're some product on market, they claim that they have liver cleansing effect but in the end hurt the liver as well
31/10/2016, 12:19 - Mom: like GNC products
31/10/2016, 12:20 - Mom: they're made in china
31/10/2016, 12:20 - Cindy LEUNG: its got dandelion and burdock roots, berberine root, milk thistle extract and uva-ursi extract
31/10/2016, 12:20 - Cindy LEUNG: thorne is in idaho
31/10/2016, 12:20 - Mom: just take care
31/10/2016, 12:20 - Mom: i know
31/10/2016, 12:21 - Cindy LEUNG: same brand as taurine
31/10/2016, 12:21 - Mom: i know
31/10/2016, 12:45 - Cindy LEUNG: woe burdock root is good for eczema
31/10/2016, 12:46 - Cindy LEUNG: oh its called ÁâõËí°, that weird root thingy u see in supermarket.
31/10/2016, 12:46 - Mom: Kk
31/10/2016, 12:47 - Mom: In fact, TCM is rlly good
31/10/2016, 12:47 - Cindy LEUNG: this website makes it sound like some miracle veggie
31/10/2016, 12:47 - Cindy LEUNG: http://www.tkithealth.com/tcm-chinese-herbs-the-amazing-herbs-burdock-root-%E7%89%9B%E8%92%A1%E8%8C%B6/
31/10/2016, 12:47 - Mom: The only concern is that some mainlanders's heart aren't too good
31/10/2016, 12:48 - Cindy LEUNG: shame
31/10/2016, 12:48 - Mom: Sigh
31/10/2016, 12:48 - Cindy LEUNG: but this root is really good
31/10/2016, 12:48 - Cindy LEUNG: u might want to try on emos
31/10/2016, 12:49 - Mom: Gingseng is also good
31/10/2016, 12:49 - Mom: Her eczema is ok now
31/10/2016, 12:49 - Cindy LEUNG: but doesn't it cycle
31/10/2016, 12:50 - Cindy LEUNG: like i becomes back sometimes.
31/10/2016, 12:50 - Mom: Her face is not hot anymore and so soft + smooth
31/10/2016, 12:50 - Cindy LEUNG: what
31/10/2016, 12:50 - Cindy LEUNG: did u guys do
31/10/2016, 12:50 - Mom: Its been wuite a long timeher eczema has gone
31/10/2016, 12:50 - Mom: But she had some other unknown rashes
31/10/2016, 12:50 - Cindy LEUNG: oh i see
31/10/2016, 12:51 - Cindy LEUNG: so the weird patches on her body aren't eczema
31/10/2016, 12:51 - Mom: Surely not
31/10/2016, 12:52 - Mom: those rashes appeared mostly on her lower back around the butt
31/10/2016, 12:52 - Mom: dunno why?
31/10/2016, 12:52 - Cindy LEUNG: hmm
31/10/2016, 12:53 - Cindy LEUNG: doesn't sound like a viral infection
31/10/2016, 12:53 - Mom: i had once suspect but she didn't have any sign of flu??
31/10/2016, 16:43 - Cindy LEUNG: that liver cleanse pill has so many ingredients which support kidney and urinary system
31/10/2016, 16:43 - Cindy LEUNG: does that mean bloating is a symptom of problems in the liver?
31/10/2016, 16:43 - Mom: So?
31/10/2016, 16:44 - Cindy LEUNG: or water retention
31/10/2016, 16:44 - Mom: Why?
31/10/2016, 16:44 - Cindy LEUNG: just based on the ingredients they use to detox liver
31/10/2016, 16:45 - Cindy LEUNG: regulation of water levels seems related to liver operation
31/10/2016, 16:45 - Cindy LEUNG: or waste management
31/10/2016, 16:45 - Cindy LEUNG: diabetes would probably effect the liver then
31/10/2016, 16:45 - Mom: hmm
31/10/2016, 16:46 - Mom: no, shud be kidney
31/10/2016, 16:46 - Cindy LEUNG: yea and kidney
31/10/2016, 16:46 - Mom: it's the kidney that regulate water retention
31/10/2016, 16:46 - Cindy LEUNG: i meant to say that the liver and kidney seem closely linked?
31/10/2016, 16:46 - Mom: ofc
31/10/2016, 16:47 - Cindy LEUNG: but why the herbs for cleansing liver work on urinary system
31/10/2016, 16:47 - Cindy LEUNG: instead
31/10/2016, 16:47 - Mom: liver is for waste/toxin discharge, kidney for water balance
31/10/2016, 16:48 - Cindy LEUNG: yeah i mean
31/10/2016, 16:48 - Mom: it has herbs for kidney as well?
31/10/2016, 16:48 - Cindy LEUNG: like there's a diuretic in there
31/10/2016, 16:48 - Cindy LEUNG: and then lots of stuff which support urinary processes
31/10/2016, 16:48 - Cindy LEUNG: and stuff which works against work retention
31/10/2016, 16:48 - Cindy LEUNG: water
31/10/2016, 16:50 - Mom: i think the chinese medicine system work on all the body organs as a whole, which means they don't just fix one particular illness through one organ but with herbs affecting a combination of different organ in our body
31/10/2016, 16:50 - Mom: so when they treat liver waste, u still need ways to carry away those waste out of ur body
31/10/2016, 16:51 - Cindy LEUNG: i ee
31/10/2016, 16:51 - Cindy LEUNG: its' not tmc
31/10/2016, 16:51 - Cindy LEUNG: i'm just talking about my supplements
31/10/2016, 16:51 - Mom: i know
31/10/2016, 16:51 - Mom: but those r herbs rite
31/10/2016, 16:52 - Cindy LEUNG: its like a yellow powder
31/10/2016, 16:54 - Cindy LEUNG: ah also

31/10/2016, 16:55 - Mom: so, how's it on u?
31/10/2016, 16:55 - Cindy LEUNG: but  i found that ribose seems to drain my energy instead.

31/10/2016, 17:08 - Cindy LEUNG: yea i dunno why
31/10/2016, 17:08 - Cindy LEUNG: this is why  it think its the ribose
31/10/2016, 17:08 - Mom: what's wrong with u? always typo?
31/10/2016, 17:08 - Cindy LEUNG: i'm on computer
31/10/2016, 17:09 - Mom: sure, its ribose
31/10/2016, 17:09 - Mom: effect is so obvious
31/10/2016, 17:09 - Cindy LEUNG: but ribose suppose to make u more energetic
31/10/2016, 17:10 - Mom: that mean u don't have that prob la
31/10/2016, 17:10 - Cindy LEUNG: yea i think we can rule out CFS/ME
31/10/2016, 17:12 - Mom: how's ur reaction after taking cholinergic drugs?
31/10/2016, 17:13 - Cindy LEUNG: well i took acetyl coa
31/10/2016, 17:13 - Cindy LEUNG: last year
31/10/2016, 17:14 - Cindy LEUNG: cholinergic drugs are have immediately obvious effect
31/10/2016, 17:14 - Cindy LEUNG: and they seem to make me more tired after a while
31/10/2016, 17:14 - Cindy LEUNG: like with the acetylcholine
31/10/2016, 17:15 - Cindy LEUNG: i think i slept less
31/10/2016, 17:15 - Cindy LEUNG: but i was fatigue for the whole day.
31/10/2016, 17:15 - Cindy LEUNG: so in other words
31/10/2016, 17:16 - Cindy LEUNG: i crashed. which is pretty normal
31/10/2016, 17:16 - Cindy LEUNG: but i crash fast
31/10/2016, 17:16 - Cindy LEUNG: not to mention, i still do that weird thing which i sleep immediately post vigorous activity
31/10/2016, 17:17 - Mom: cholinergic drugs work on ur parasympathetic system which means it calms ur body down on the whole
31/10/2016, 17:17 - Cindy LEUNG: i thought cholinergics give u more energy
31/10/2016, 17:17 - Mom: no ah
31/10/2016, 17:17 - Mom: reverse
31/10/2016, 17:18 - Mom: drugs work on ur sympathetic system is to boost up ur energy
31/10/2016, 17:18 - Mom: no wonder, u took the wrong drugs
31/10/2016, 17:19 - Cindy LEUNG: ok cholinergics work on ur muscles
31/10/2016, 17:19 - Cindy LEUNG: i thought they 'help' your muscles use more ATP
31/10/2016, 17:20 - Cindy LEUNG: ai this confuses me
31/10/2016, 17:20 - Cindy LEUNG: i'll ask the med student.
31/10/2016, 17:20 - Cindy LEUNG: ok i took the wrong drug
31/10/2016, 17:21 - Cindy LEUNG: did u know SSRIs increase activity in the hippocampus?
31/10/2016, 17:21 - Cindy LEUNG: i just remembered that from the lecture i went to last week
31/10/2016, 17:21 - Cindy LEUNG: and cortisol does the opposite, it blocks neurogenesis
31/10/2016, 17:22 - Mom: ssri? have to double check
31/10/2016, 17:22 - Mom: so? what's ur point?
31/10/2016, 17:22 - Mom: ok, just stop that ribose
31/10/2016, 17:22 - Cindy LEUNG: well ok
31/10/2016, 17:23 - Cindy LEUNG: i just wanted to try to see if it was CFS

31/10/2016, 17:30 - Mom: when? before or after having this sleep prob?
31/10/2016, 17:30 - Mom: if same situation, then no prob on sweating
31/10/2016, 17:30 - Cindy LEUNG: nvm i don't think sweating is relevant.
31/10/2016, 17:30 - Mom: everybody sweats after heavy exercise
31/10/2016, 17:30 - Cindy LEUNG: but i think it probably made my body temp drop.
31/10/2016, 17:30 - Cindy LEUNG: i fell asleep in pilates again

31/10/2016, 17:31 - Cindy LEUNG: i don't always fall asleep, so i was trying to work out why

01/11/2016, 03:24 - Cindy LEUNG: Those people who apply r so hard core they like shoe up to every career event, get a few LinkedIns
01/11/2016, 03:24 - Mom: I can imagine
01/11/2016, 03:25 - Cindy LEUNG: Though if Ur grades are good and Ur degree is good, u pretty much automatically get to interviews
01/11/2016, 03:26 - Mom: So, guarantee offer?
01/11/2016, 03:26 - Cindy LEUNG: No
01/11/2016, 03:26 - Cindy LEUNG: Rothschild only takes 3-4 interns a year

01/11/2016, 03:28 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea I guess
01/11/2016, 03:28 - Cindy LEUNG: They probably lay off more people too
01/11/2016, 03:28 - Cindy LEUNG: Banks do weird things.
01/11/2016, 03:28 - Mom: Hahaha
01/11/2016, 03:28 - Cindy LEUNG: A lot of weird things happen in the economy
01/11/2016, 03:28 - Cindy LEUNG: Like taxes.
01/11/2016, 03:29 - Mom: Why taxes weird?
01/11/2016, 03:29 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz a lot of them don't make sense
01/11/2016, 03:30 - Mom: How?
01/11/2016, 03:30 - Cindy LEUNG: We're doing taxes in micro and I find it really interesting
01/11/2016, 03:30 - Mom: Agree
01/11/2016, 03:30 - Cindy LEUNG: Like did u know lump sum tax would be the most efficient form oof taxation
01/11/2016, 03:31 - Cindy LEUNG: Everything else generates wastage
01/11/2016, 03:31 - Mom: In what aspect efficient?
01/11/2016, 03:32 - Cindy LEUNG: Like economically efficient
01/11/2016, 03:32 - Mom: Oh we didnt discuss this
01/11/2016, 03:32 - Cindy LEUNG: U can draw a graph and analyze how efficient it is.
01/11/2016, 03:32 - Mom: We just learn what and how to do taxation
01/11/2016, 03:33 - Cindy LEUNG: Well yah cuz this is econ, u work towards learning how to derive better tax plan but then no one will listen to you went u get to that stage
01/11/2016, 03:35 - Mom: Haha
01/11/2016, 03:35 - Mom: If u want ppl listen to u, u need political strategy
01/11/2016, 03:36 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea I guess that is the government bit
01/11/2016, 03:37 - Cindy LEUNG: Not like they hv much to say abt persuasion then.
01/11/2016, 03:37 - Cindy LEUNG: Its all abt fixing the game beforehand
01/11/2016, 03:37 - Cindy LEUNG: U set it up so it's in Ur favour
01/11/2016, 03:38 - Cindy LEUNG: I feel like we're approaching that sort of argument
01/11/2016, 03:38 - Mom: This is the job of a govt official
01/11/2016, 03:38 - Cindy LEUNG: I.e. my motto, don't ask a question if u don't know the answer
01/11/2016, 03:39 - Mom: Interesting
01/11/2016, 03:40 - Mom: But how to investigate sci new tech or discoveries if u need to know the ans in adv?
01/11/2016, 03:40 - Cindy LEUNG: Well this apply to certain questions mah
01/11/2016, 03:40 - Mom: K
01/11/2016, 03:41 - Cindy LEUNG: I.e. so basically I mean to say don't ask for permission if u aren't sure if it's a yes
01/11/2016, 03:41 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz there's no point
01/11/2016, 03:42 - Mom: Err...
01/11/2016, 03:43 - Mom: What if ur not sure abt the chances of yes/no? But still hv a chance
01/11/2016, 03:43 - Cindy LEUNG: Then just do it.
01/11/2016, 03:43 - Cindy LEUNG: I feel like asking has a good
01/11/2016, 03:43 - Cindy LEUNG: Different purpose
01/11/2016, 03:44 - Cindy LEUNG: Like by asking, I'm just telling u what I plan to do
01/11/2016, 03:44 - Cindy LEUNG: In a polite way
01/11/2016, 03:45 - Mom: Erm
01/11/2016, 03:46 - Mom: Nvr hv this thought but u hv ur point
01/11/2016, 03:47 - Cindy LEUNG: Really
01/11/2016, 03:47 - Cindy LEUNG: Wow
01/11/2016, 03:47 - Cindy LEUNG: U never needed to do something but likely to not get permission for it
01/11/2016, 03:49 - Cindy LEUNG: But whatevs that's politics for you.
01/11/2016, 03:50 - Mom: My way is to decide the possibility of failure if i didnt get a permisaion beforehand
01/11/2016, 03:51 - Mom: If chances r slim, then try to persuade ppl to get permission
01/11/2016, 03:51 - Cindy LEUNG: I see
01/11/2016, 03:52 - Cindy LEUNG: Omg I hv an hr to go

01/11/2016, 15:56 - Cindy LEUNG: Baby spirits
01/11/2016, 15:57 - Mom: Its true, i tend to believe this
01/11/2016, 15:57 - Cindy LEUNG: He said he didn't see any in holborn though
01/11/2016, 15:58 - Cindy LEUNG: He also said that they don't attack him, but they can seem to move objects
01/11/2016, 16:00 - Mom: Do u afraid of this man?
01/11/2016, 16:00 - Cindy LEUNG: Whereas sleep paralysis seems different, its like related to breathing problem nearly all the time
01/11/2016, 16:00 - Cindy LEUNG: No
01/11/2016, 16:00 - Mom: Be careful of him
01/11/2016, 16:00 - Cindy LEUNG: I just can't decide whether to believe him or not.
01/11/2016, 16:00 - Mom: Not trust this man
01/11/2016, 16:00 - Mom: Cuz u never know if he'll do any harm to u
01/11/2016, 16:01 - Cindy LEUNG: Like I question whether he's a pathological liar
01/11/2016, 16:01 - Mom: U can listen to his story, but just as story
01/11/2016, 16:01 - Cindy LEUNG: He's Christian
01/11/2016, 16:01 - Cindy LEUNG: üòë
01/11/2016, 16:01 - Mom: Dont take too much of them
01/11/2016, 16:02 - Mom: Christain doesnt mean anything
01/11/2016, 16:02 - Cindy LEUNG: Like he's not Buddhist
01/11/2016, 16:02 - Cindy LEUNG: Or tao
01/11/2016, 16:02 - Cindy LEUNG: Why
01/11/2016, 16:02 - Cindy LEUNG: Then I ask him how he gets rid of them
01/11/2016, 16:02 - Cindy LEUNG: He says he prays
01/11/2016, 16:03 - Mom: ppl sometimes claim christian to get other ppl's trust
01/11/2016, 16:03 - Cindy LEUNG: Should I just learn to believe in God then.
01/11/2016, 16:03 - Cindy LEUNG: Well I hv nothing of value.
01/11/2016, 16:04 - Mom: i don't actuall mean he's this kind of man, but be skeptical
01/11/2016, 16:04 - Cindy LEUNG: Ofc lah
01/11/2016, 16:04 - Mom: u can try go to church to learn bible teaching
01/11/2016, 16:04 - Cindy LEUNG: I feel like I should
01/11/2016, 16:04 - Mom: but no rush
01/11/2016, 16:04 - Cindy LEUNG: Now
01/11/2016, 16:05 - Mom: no rush to believe in god
01/11/2016, 16:05 - Cindy LEUNG: He also said getting angry at them worked
01/11/2016, 16:05 - Mom: and u must be sure that the church u go to is a proper church, not a pseudo-church
01/11/2016, 16:05 - Mom: u told him abt ur sleep paralysis?
01/11/2016, 16:06 - Cindy LEUNG: I remember I got really pissed off one night in holborn and it worked
01/11/2016, 16:06 - Mom: but he said there's none in holborn
01/11/2016, 16:06 - Cindy LEUNG: He said he never sae
01/11/2016, 16:06 - Cindy LEUNG: Saw
01/11/2016, 16:06 - Cindy LEUNG: But it comes and goes for him
01/11/2016, 16:07 - Mom: he never seen at holborn or anything?
01/11/2016, 16:07 - Mom: for what?
01/11/2016, 16:07 - Cindy LEUNG: I think it's kind of weird why a lot of weird shit suddenly happened to me in holborn
01/11/2016, 16:07 - Mom: possession?
01/11/2016, 16:07 - Mom: ask for help?
01/11/2016, 16:07 - Cindy LEUNG: No like spirits
01/11/2016, 16:07 - Cindy LEUNG: He used to live in holborn
01/11/2016, 16:07 - Cindy LEUNG: I knew him from last year.
01/11/2016, 16:08 - Cindy LEUNG: Not in my flat
01/11/2016, 16:08 - Mom: u knew him from last yr but never knew he has xx eyes?
01/11/2016, 16:08 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea
01/11/2016, 16:08 - Mom: errr
01/11/2016, 16:09 - Cindy LEUNG: Its not like I go around saying hey I feel stuff in my sleeo
01/11/2016, 16:09 - Mom: so why he told u abt it now?
01/11/2016, 16:09 - Mom: yea, ur right
01/11/2016, 16:09 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz I told him that my flatmates in holborn hallucinate
01/11/2016, 16:10 - Mom: good tactics
01/11/2016, 16:10 - Cindy LEUNG: And then he didn't seem very surprised
01/11/2016, 16:10 - Cindy LEUNG: And then he was like yeah I see that stuff
01/11/2016, 16:10 - Mom: wait
01/11/2016, 16:10 - Mom: he said he never seen one in holborn?
01/11/2016, 16:10 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea
01/11/2016, 16:11 - Cindy LEUNG: But he lived on the second floor
01/11/2016, 16:11 - Mom: but he's not surprised that someone saw one in holborn?
01/11/2016, 16:11 - Cindy LEUNG: No hes not surprised that people hallucinate
01/11/2016, 16:11 - Mom: cherr
01/11/2016, 16:11 - Mom: he lived on top of ur floor at holborn?
01/11/2016, 16:12 - Cindy LEUNG: Like if I told someone that three people live in the same flat and saw/heard/ felt weird stuff all the time
01/11/2016, 16:12 - Cindy LEUNG: That sounds really dodgy
01/11/2016, 16:12 - Mom: yea, rlly dodgy
01/11/2016, 16:12 - Cindy LEUNG: Exactly
01/11/2016, 16:13 - Cindy LEUNG: Anyways
01/11/2016, 16:13 - Cindy LEUNG: I'm reluctant to believe this stuff
01/11/2016, 16:13 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz I'm a woman of science
01/11/2016, 16:13 - Cindy LEUNG: But.....
01/11/2016, 16:14 - Cindy LEUNG: What he describes sort of matches.
01/11/2016, 16:14 - Mom: my approach is: respect them but always stay away from them
01/11/2016, 16:14 - Mom: whether they exist or not
01/11/2016, 16:15 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea I can't see them so thats good
01/11/2016, 16:15 - Cindy LEUNG: I think they disturb u more if they know u can and want u to pay attention to them.
01/11/2016, 16:15 - Mom: sure
01/11/2016, 16:15 - Cindy LEUNG: He says he's never been attacked
01/11/2016, 16:16 - Mom: so better not to interact with them
01/11/2016, 16:16 - Cindy LEUNG: But I don't know what protection rituals he's done
01/11/2016, 16:16 - Mom: just mind ur own business
01/11/2016, 16:17 - Mom: this is best way to protect urself
01/11/2016, 16:17 - Cindy LEUNG: I just worry they attack me
01/11/2016, 16:17 - Mom: i dont think so, if u don't go for them
01/11/2016, 16:17 - Cindy LEUNG: Or like if I see one suddenly, like a jump scare, I will probably faint
01/11/2016, 16:18 - Cindy LEUNG: But I haven't experienced anything at all in urbanest
01/11/2016, 16:18 - Mom: relax
01/11/2016, 16:18 - Cindy LEUNG: Except nightmares.
01/11/2016, 16:18 - Mom: u think too much la
01/11/2016, 16:18 - Cindy LEUNG: So I think I will be fine.
01/11/2016, 16:19 - Mom: remember to mind ur own road, not to be bossy
01/11/2016, 16:19 - Mom: nothing wud hurt u
01/11/2016, 16:19 - Cindy LEUNG: Its not like I'm out searching for them
01/11/2016, 16:19 - Mom: why the hell they wanna attack u?
01/11/2016, 16:19 - Cindy LEUNG: I don't know
01/11/2016, 16:19 - Mom: u think they're so powerful?
01/11/2016, 16:20 - Mom: i can tell u : not
01/11/2016, 16:20 - Cindy LEUNG: I don't expect them to be rational beings anyway
01/11/2016, 16:20 - Mom: they can't even think, don't apply ur knowledge on them
01/11/2016, 16:20 - Cindy LEUNG: Ok
01/11/2016, 16:20 - Mom: it's just u who scare urself
01/11/2016, 16:20 - Cindy LEUNG: So apparently Cambridge has a lot
01/11/2016, 16:21 - Mom: maybe
01/11/2016, 16:21 - Mom: cuz cambridge is so old
01/11/2016, 16:21 - Cindy LEUNG: He kept on talking abt how he saw a lot of them in Cambridge
01/11/2016, 16:21 - Cindy LEUNG: üò∞
01/11/2016, 16:22 - Mom: he went to cambridge all the time
01/11/2016, 16:22 - Cindy LEUNG: No that one time he went there for interview
01/11/2016, 16:22 - Mom: hahaha
01/11/2016, 16:23 - Cindy LEUNG: Just that time he recounted three experiences
01/11/2016, 16:23 - Mom: wow, 3 experiences
01/11/2016, 16:23 - Mom: that's a lot in so short time
01/11/2016, 16:23 - Mom: is he afraid?
01/11/2016, 16:23 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea Cambridge is haunted
01/11/2016, 16:23 - Mom: so lucky that u were not there
01/11/2016, 16:24 - Cindy LEUNG: The weird thing is that everyone else I know that hallucinates regularly thinks it's like normal
01/11/2016, 16:24 - Cindy LEUNG: They don't get scared
01/11/2016, 16:24 - Cindy LEUNG: How
01/11/2016, 16:25 - Mom: if seeing things become a habit, how can a person stop it?
01/11/2016, 16:25 - Cindy LEUNG: Well yea
01/11/2016, 16:25 - Mom: i guess these ppl suffering from hallucinations do rlly want to stop their hallucinations, but they just can't
01/11/2016, 16:25 - Mom: they're so poor
01/11/2016, 16:25 - Cindy LEUNG: But occasionally if I hear stuff I get scared
01/11/2016, 16:26 - Mom: don't think u hear thing, just keep normal
01/11/2016, 16:26 - Mom: tell urself that those sound doesn't exist
01/11/2016, 16:26 - Mom: this is the way to keep urself calm down
01/11/2016, 16:26 - Cindy LEUNG: But with me its more like I'm worried something is really wrong with my brain
01/11/2016, 16:27 - Cindy LEUNG: Like I don't need any extra illnesses
01/11/2016, 16:27 - Mom: don't bother what's inside or outside weird, just keep doing ur daily routine
01/11/2016, 16:27 - Cindy LEUNG: I think I have anxiety over getting sick
01/11/2016, 16:28 - Mom: yea, ur always scared by ur own anxiety
01/11/2016, 16:28 - Cindy LEUNG: More than being possessed
01/11/2016, 16:28 - Cindy LEUNG: Its like I can't trust my body to work properly
01/11/2016, 16:28 - Cindy LEUNG: Whereas with them, they just don't know why they're seeing weird shit
01/11/2016, 16:29 - Cindy LEUNG: So they can get on with life and I'm like stuck here.
01/11/2016, 16:30 - Mom: maybe ur case is temporary, who knows what happen next
01/11/2016, 16:31 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea that's also the problem
01/11/2016, 16:31 - Cindy LEUNG: Who knows what happens next
01/11/2016, 16:31 - Cindy LEUNG: Im also feel a sense of detachment when people talk abt the things they do for fun
01/11/2016, 16:32 - Mom: why?
01/11/2016, 16:32 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz
01/11/2016, 16:32 - Cindy LEUNG: I don't have a life outside of work?
01/11/2016, 16:33 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz my life outside of work is my health problems
01/11/2016, 16:33 - Cindy LEUNG: So I just want to work all the time.
01/11/2016, 16:33 - Mom: speechlessssssss

03/11/2016, 00:18 - Cindy LEUNG: I thought this headphone was stuck magneticay to my face
03/11/2016, 00:18 - Cindy LEUNG: Yes duh
03/11/2016, 00:18 - Cindy LEUNG: Why else would I report them together
03/11/2016, 00:19 - Cindy LEUNG: I'm talking abt a single incident which just happened
03/11/2016, 00:19 - Cindy LEUNG: If that makes things cleaer
03/11/2016, 00:19 - Mom: when u said "i thought", it's rlly confusing cuz i don't know if this is ur personal opinion or ur "hallucination"
03/11/2016, 00:20 - Cindy LEUNG: Well I didn't want to use the term hallucination cuz I'm not sure if they r or not
03/11/2016, 00:20 - Mom: u can say "i dreamed or i saw thing in my dream"
03/11/2016, 00:20 - Cindy LEUNG: But I didn't dream
03/11/2016, 00:21 - Mom: why not dream?
03/11/2016, 00:21 - Cindy LEUNG: I was sitting in my bed and I had this headphone magnetically St UCk to my face which I tried to pull off
03/11/2016, 00:22 - Mom: ur fully conscious?
03/11/2016, 00:24 - Cindy LEUNG: But it was very difficult to move my arm
03/11/2016, 00:25 - Cindy LEUNG: I just dozed off for two minutes
03/11/2016, 00:25 - Mom: haaa
03/11/2016, 00:25 - Cindy LEUNG: I think it's finally over
03/11/2016, 00:25 - Mom: was it sleep paralysis?
03/11/2016, 00:26 - Mom: u said u went stupid briefly, how stupid?
03/11/2016, 00:26 - Cindy LEUNG: Not sure
03/11/2016, 00:27 - Cindy LEUNG: Not exactly sleep paralysis cuz now I've heard a couple of different recounts of it, actual so seems to always be associated with breathing difficulties as well
03/11/2016, 00:28 - Cindy LEUNG: Actual sp
03/11/2016, 00:30 - Mom: hmm
03/11/2016, 00:31 - Mom: i just don't understand, u seem to have more different kinds of incident in london than in hk? why?
03/11/2016, 00:31 - Cindy LEUNG: no the incidents are the same
03/11/2016, 00:32 - Cindy LEUNG: i'm just using different words to describe them
03/11/2016, 00:32 - Cindy LEUNG: and u can't seem to match them together
03/11/2016, 00:32 - Mom: ok
03/11/2016, 00:33 - Cindy LEUNG: i also started seeing green text abt 30 mins before i went into seizure
03/11/2016, 00:33 - Mom: maybe when u described them in different terms, i thought a new symptom appears
03/11/2016, 00:34 - Cindy LEUNG: yea
03/11/2016, 00:34 - Cindy LEUNG: my point exactly
03/11/2016, 00:34 - Mom: always the case? i mean seeing green text 30 mins before going in to seizure?
03/11/2016, 00:34 - Cindy LEUNG: no remember i'm still describing one single incident
03/11/2016, 00:35 - Mom: ok
03/11/2016, 00:35 - Mom: so i was wondering if there's any correlation between these two incidents?
03/11/2016, 00:36 - Cindy LEUNG: i had instant noodles for dinner, with 2 crabsticks and 3 fishballs
03/11/2016, 00:36 - Cindy LEUNG: and green beans
03/11/2016, 00:36 - Cindy LEUNG: and i also had a couple of grapes
03/11/2016, 00:36 - Mom: u think these matter?
03/11/2016, 00:36 - Cindy LEUNG: then i drank two cups of the korean ginseng thing
03/11/2016, 00:37 - Cindy LEUNG: no just writing them down so that we're on same page and for record purposes
03/11/2016, 00:37 - Mom: how long u had rem seizure after those food intake?
03/11/2016, 00:37 - Cindy LEUNG: i ate at 9 i think
03/11/2016, 00:37 - Cindy LEUNG: so its quite a long time already.
03/11/2016, 00:38 - Cindy LEUNG: yep i ate at 9
03/11/2016, 00:38 - Cindy LEUNG: its been 3 hrs
03/11/2016, 00:38 - Cindy LEUNG: these sort of events happened more often in holborn
03/11/2016, 00:39 - Mom: ??
03/11/2016, 00:39 - Mom: any correlation with food?
03/11/2016, 00:39 - Cindy LEUNG: yeah they mostly happened in the kitchen after meals
03/11/2016, 00:39 - Mom: fairly short time?
03/11/2016, 00:40 - Mom: after meal
03/11/2016, 00:40 - Cindy LEUNG: i'd sit there and suddenly start hearing a lot of stuff
03/11/2016, 00:40 - Cindy LEUNG: not sure, like 30 mins
03/11/2016, 00:40 - Cindy LEUNG: definitely not 3 hrs, i didn't sit in the kitchen for 3 hrs
03/11/2016, 00:40 - Mom: 30 mins after meal shud be the start of digestion
03/11/2016, 00:41 - Mom: 3 hrs, ur food already been digested and gone into the small intestine
03/11/2016, 00:41 - Cindy LEUNG: yes that's why i thought these were correlated to the gut last year
03/11/2016, 00:42 - Cindy LEUNG: but then i went back to hk
03/11/2016, 00:42 - Cindy LEUNG: and then the correlation times changed
03/11/2016, 00:42 - Mom: how often did these happened in hk?
03/11/2016, 00:42 - Cindy LEUNG: not very
03/11/2016, 00:42 - Mom: from my observation, not a lot
03/11/2016, 00:43 - Cindy LEUNG: they tend to happen when i'm alone.
03/11/2016, 00:43 - Mom: this is the mystery???
03/11/2016, 00:44 - Mom: as i always say u had more symptoms when ur alone in uk
03/11/2016, 00:44 - Cindy LEUNG: that's because i spent more time alone in the uk
03/11/2016, 00:44 - Cindy LEUNG: i also go stupid
03/11/2016, 00:44 - Mom: yea, i know u spent more time alone in uk
03/11/2016, 00:45 - Cindy LEUNG: during teh seizure i meant
03/11/2016, 00:45 - Mom: but my point is why things only happened in uk always
03/11/2016, 00:45 - Mom: what do u mean u go stupid when u had seizure?
03/11/2016, 00:45 - Cindy LEUNG: i thnk those hallucinations are real
03/11/2016, 00:46 - Cindy LEUNG: and during the seizure they make sense to me
03/11/2016, 00:46 - Cindy LEUNG: i couldn't really move
03/11/2016, 00:47 - Mom: now?
03/11/2016, 00:47 - Cindy LEUNG: but i could move my arms if i tried really hard
03/11/2016, 00:47 - Cindy LEUNG: during teh seizure
03/11/2016, 00:47 - Mom: no la, just relax
03/11/2016, 00:47 - Cindy LEUNG: ?
03/11/2016, 00:47 - Cindy LEUNG: notice the use of tense
03/11/2016, 00:47 - Cindy LEUNG: i used could instead of can't
03/11/2016, 00:48 - Mom: ok, u think u can move during ur seizure moment?
03/11/2016, 00:49 - Cindy LEUNG: its difficult, not impossible
03/11/2016, 00:49 - Cindy LEUNG: i kept on brushing away the headphone study on my face with my hand and that took a lot of effort
03/11/2016, 00:49 - Cindy LEUNG: but i kept trying idk
03/11/2016, 00:50 - Cindy LEUNG: and then meanwhile i thought the bj girl finally saw a cockroach in her room and they were trying to vacuum it away. (i heard a vacuum like sound on for the whole time)
03/11/2016, 00:51 - Mom: ok, would u think u were just having rem or vivid dream?
03/11/2016, 00:51 - Cindy LEUNG: i didn't see it
03/11/2016, 00:51 - Cindy LEUNG: i heard all of it in my bed
03/11/2016, 00:52 - Cindy LEUNG: and i actually got worried that the cockroach would be able to slip under my door
03/11/2016, 00:52 - Cindy LEUNG: i wasn't sleeping thats the thing
03/11/2016, 00:52 - Cindy LEUNG: and then after about 15 mins, i 'snapped' out of it
03/11/2016, 00:52 - Mom: haaa
03/11/2016, 00:53 - Mom: how? what's the triggering event to let "snapped" out
03/11/2016, 00:53 - Cindy LEUNG: nothing
03/11/2016, 00:53 - Cindy LEUNG: u just wait
03/11/2016, 00:53 - Cindy LEUNG: for time to pass until appo time
03/11/2016, 00:54 - Cindy LEUNG: sigh
03/11/2016, 00:58 - Cindy LEUNG: only the green text seems to be completely new this year
03/11/2016, 00:58 - Mom: yea
03/11/2016, 00:59 - Cindy LEUNG: I also took a nap this afternoon so I shouldn't be that tired
03/11/2016, 01:01 - Mom: my point is: wud ur 15 mins "hallucination" be just going into rem sleep which u didn't aware
03/11/2016, 03:26 - Cindy LEUNG: yeah
03/11/2016, 03:26 - Cindy LEUNG: thats what it is
03/11/2016, 03:26 - Cindy LEUNG: but the rem is a bit different
03/11/2016, 03:27 - Cindy LEUNG: so my question is
03/11/2016, 03:27 - Cindy LEUNG: why do i sometimes go in to a hallucinatory rem
03/11/2016, 03:27 - Cindy LEUNG: and sometimes i go into a rem which i just dream vividly?
03/11/2016, 03:28 - Cindy LEUNG: but nvm, at least i know that there wasn't a cockroach now
03/11/2016, 03:37 - Mom: üò©
03/11/2016, 03:51 - Cindy LEUNG: üôÇ

03/11/2016, 11:33 - Cindy LEUNG: I bought it
03/11/2016, 11:33 - Cindy LEUNG: What do I do with it
03/11/2016, 11:34 - Mom: rub skin off, and cut it into slices and put 3-4 pcs into hot water, soaked for few mins and then drink water

03/11/2016, 11:37 - Mom: no, ur skin used to be white
03/11/2016, 11:37 - Cindy LEUNG: Like the first one?
03/11/2016, 11:37 - Mom: next time write a number on the paper which u took photo with u
03/11/2016, 11:38 - Mom: it's so funny when u take photo with a piece of paper

03/11/2016, 11:39 - Cindy LEUNG: How else do I know what's white
03/11/2016, 11:39 - Mom: contrast with a piece of white paper
03/11/2016, 11:39 - Cindy LEUNG: First one is with window lighting
03/11/2016, 11:39 - Mom: so, it's natural light?
03/11/2016, 11:39 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea
03/11/2016, 11:40 - Mom: first one is normal, imo
03/11/2016, 11:40 - Mom: because the background stuffs look normal as well
03/11/2016, 11:40 - Mom: second one is too yellow, the background as well
03/11/2016, 11:41 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea I thought the second one looked a bit yellow as well
03/11/2016, 11:41 - Cindy LEUNG: But the paper is white.
03/11/2016, 11:41 - Mom: it's like shooting in a yellow lighting room
03/11/2016, 11:42 - Cindy LEUNG: Actually I think the first one is right
03/11/2016, 11:42 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz the cupboard door behind me is white
03/11/2016, 11:42 - Mom: look at the wall, what colour is it? white or yellowish?
03/11/2016, 11:42 - Mom: that's how i think

03/11/2016, 11:49 - Mom: this one is better cuz paper is white
03/11/2016, 11:50 - Mom: skin colour more normal and natural
03/11/2016, 11:50 - Mom: and my conclusion is still ur eyes white is a bit blue

03/11/2016, 11:51 - Cindy LEUNG: How
03/11/2016, 11:51 - Mom: put 974 ointment onto the  rash above ur nose

04/11/2016, 14:44 - Cindy LEUNG: I don't get it üò≠
04/11/2016, 14:44 - Mom: Can u ask help from tutor or senior?
04/11/2016, 14:44 - Mom: Or pay for private tutor
04/11/2016, 14:44 - Mom: I know uk dont charge that expensive
04/11/2016, 14:46 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea I need a see how I can revise.
04/11/2016, 14:46 - Cindy LEUNG: Like I allocate a day to micro and it's very productive I get through everything
04/11/2016, 14:46 - Mom: Go find a private tutor if there's need
04/11/2016, 14:46 - Cindy LEUNG: But I do the same for macro and it doesn't seem to work.
04/11/2016, 14:47 - Mom: Go find help
04/11/2016, 14:47 - Mom: This is the way to relieve stress
04/11/2016, 14:47 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea my problem is not that there's no help
04/11/2016, 14:47 - Cindy LEUNG: I just don't know how to study the stuff
04/11/2016, 14:48 - Mom: do u understand the materials
04/11/2016, 14:48 - Cindy LEUNG: I gave up on reading the book
04/11/2016, 14:48 - Mom: what is the prob?
04/11/2016, 14:48 - Cindy LEUNG: I do when I listen to lecture, but then I need to like go through and proof everything  to realise I have gaps in my logic
04/11/2016, 14:48 - Mom: understanding or too much materials to get them properly organised and revised
04/11/2016, 14:49 - Cindy LEUNG: And the problem sets are pretty baf
04/11/2016, 14:49 - Cindy LEUNG: Pretty bad cuz they aren't like one set for each lecture
04/11/2016, 14:49 - Cindy LEUNG: So it's like when I do them there's stuff I can't do.
04/11/2016, 14:49 - Mom: try to find partners in doing problem set
04/11/2016, 14:50 - Cindy LEUNG: So it's not very good at consolidating knowledge
04/11/2016, 14:50 - Mom: any online solution for problem set?
04/11/2016, 14:50 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea there is
04/11/2016, 14:50 - Mom: do u get the point when reading the answer?
04/11/2016, 14:50 - Cindy LEUNG: Then the lesson is useless
04/11/2016, 14:51 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz they go through problem set each week
04/11/2016, 14:51 - Mom: skip the lesson
04/11/2016, 14:51 - Mom: they didn't explain problem set?
04/11/2016, 14:51 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea they explain the problems
04/11/2016, 14:51 - Cindy LEUNG: But there's no point if I haven't done them
04/11/2016, 14:52 - Cindy LEUNG: I just sit there and listen to him talk
04/11/2016, 14:52 - Cindy LEUNG: And then I fall asleep
04/11/2016, 14:52 - Mom: why don't u do it before class?
04/11/2016, 14:52 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz there are problems u can't do
04/11/2016, 14:52 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz they haven't gone through them yet
04/11/2016, 14:52 - Cindy LEUNG: Like sometimes a third of the set is like that
04/11/2016, 14:52 - Cindy LEUNG: I'm like wtf who designed this course
04/11/2016, 14:53 - Cindy LEUNG: Everything is out of sync that's the problem
04/11/2016, 14:53 - Cindy LEUNG: And I don't know how to study with this shit
04/11/2016, 14:53 - Mom: ur saying that there're still something not being taught when u do the prob set, so u can't finish those prob set
04/11/2016, 14:53 - Cindy LEUNG: Yes
04/11/2016, 14:53 - Mom: omg
04/11/2016, 14:53 - Mom: then u just go for a private tutor la
04/11/2016, 14:54 - Cindy LEUNG: And then I'm forced to follow their messed up schedule
04/11/2016, 14:54 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz I need to hand things in
04/11/2016, 14:54 - Mom: ask the tutor to teach in advance
04/11/2016, 14:54 - Cindy LEUNG: So I'm like
04/11/2016, 14:54 - Cindy LEUNG: üò±
04/11/2016, 14:54 - Mom: how's other ppl doing with the subject?
04/11/2016, 14:54 - Cindy LEUNG: Dunno
04/11/2016, 14:54 - Mom: do they encounter same prob?
04/11/2016, 14:54 - Cindy LEUNG: Depends how much time u sacrifice for it
04/11/2016, 14:55 - Cindy LEUNG: I can't put all my time on it right
04/11/2016, 14:55 - Cindy LEUNG: So it's like a quarter for each course
04/11/2016, 14:55 - Cindy LEUNG: And this one is not working
04/11/2016, 14:55 - Mom: i mean if u have this prob, other ppl must have same prob becos they cudn't have learnt those stuff before
04/11/2016, 14:56 - Mom: so they probably wud have same prob as u
04/11/2016, 14:56 - Cindy LEUNG: Well if u don't know stuff u don't say anything in class
04/11/2016, 14:56 - Mom: so it's better to find partner to study the subject
04/11/2016, 14:56 - Cindy LEUNG: That's how things roll here
04/11/2016, 14:56 - Mom: so do other ppl say a lot in class?
04/11/2016, 14:56 - Cindy LEUNG: Plus its been internship application month so everybody's probably behind
04/11/2016, 14:57 - Cindy LEUNG: Some
04/11/2016, 14:57 - Mom: or just quiet class
04/11/2016, 14:57 - Cindy LEUNG: Usually no one says anything
04/11/2016, 14:57 - Mom: err
04/11/2016, 14:57 - Cindy LEUNG: There's that one person who's done the problem set and has questions
04/11/2016, 14:57 - Mom: if nobody say a word in class, they might have same prob as urs
04/11/2016, 14:57 - Mom: ok, just stick to that person all the time
04/11/2016, 14:58 - Mom: need to be "thick face" in this circumstances
04/11/2016, 14:58 - Mom: or as i said, find a private tutor to learn things with him/her
04/11/2016, 14:59 - Mom: don't bother too much abt the tuition fee as when u compare it with the yearly time and uni fee, that's not material
04/11/2016, 15:00 - Mom: rmb that money can help solve prob and save ur time and effort
04/11/2016, 15:01 - Mom: the best way is to find a classmate doing the same subject and study together, if not private tuition is helpful, imo
04/11/2016, 15:08 - Mom: in fact, marco is harder then micro cuz it talks abt economic effect on the country as a whole, whereas micro affects only individual behaviors
04/11/2016, 15:08 - Mom: so intervening factors r more in macro
04/11/2016, 16:02 - Cindy LEUNG: Omg
04/11/2016, 16:02 - Cindy LEUNG: I just changed classes for macro
04/11/2016, 16:02 - Cindy LEUNG: The guy is so intense
04/11/2016, 16:03 - Cindy LEUNG: At least now I get three hrs to cry at the problem set in the morning
04/11/2016, 16:05 - Mom: So, is it good or bad?
04/11/2016, 16:06 - Cindy LEUNG: Well he was like
04/11/2016, 16:07 - Cindy LEUNG: Lse exam is 50% knowledge and 50‚ÑÖ strategy
04/11/2016, 16:07 - Mom: Then, he's good ah
04/11/2016, 16:08 - Mom: He tells u abt exam strategy
04/11/2016, 16:08 - Cindy LEUNG: And then u should write 70% math and 30% words
04/11/2016, 16:09 - Cindy LEUNG: Lastly the most quotable quote. Go to Oxbridge to do philosophy and talk bs
04/11/2016, 16:09 - Cindy LEUNG: Lse is math

04/11/2016, 16:17 - Mom: "Lastly the most quotable quote. Go to Oxbridge to do philosophy and talk bs"
04/11/2016, 16:17 - Cindy LEUNG: Should hv changed earlier
04/11/2016, 16:17 - Mom: i don't understand this sentence?
04/11/2016, 16:18 - Mom: i know u changed class already, u just told me
04/11/2016, 16:18 - Cindy LEUNG: He's saying don't just write words
04/11/2016, 16:18 - Mom: i'm asking if he's good or not?
04/11/2016, 16:18 - Mom: oh, i get it now
04/11/2016, 16:18 - Mom: so he's good la compared with the previous one
04/11/2016, 16:18 - Mom: good move
04/11/2016, 16:19 - Mom: is this the first lesson u changed ur macro class?
04/11/2016, 16:19 - Cindy LEUNG: Yep
04/11/2016, 16:19 - Mom: ok, then things might be better later
04/11/2016, 16:19 - Cindy LEUNG: The last one wasn't bad
04/11/2016, 16:19 - Mom: just see
04/11/2016, 16:19 - Cindy LEUNG: He answered all my questions
04/11/2016, 16:19 - Cindy LEUNG: Its just that it was early in the morning
04/11/2016, 16:20 - Mom: but u seems having so much trouble doing the problem set
04/11/2016, 16:20 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea cuz its hard af
04/11/2016, 16:22 - Cindy LEUNG: So I was told apparently they r supposed to be hard af
04/11/2016, 16:22 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz that's how u learn
04/11/2016, 16:24 - Mom: ...
04/11/2016, 16:24 - Cindy LEUNG: And only ever in macro
04/11/2016, 16:25 - Cindy LEUNG: What's the difference between saving rates in rich country and poor country
04/11/2016, 16:25 - Cindy LEUNG: He asked that like it was common sense
04/11/2016, 16:25 - Cindy LEUNG: Lol
04/11/2016, 16:28 - Cindy LEUNG: I think he's polish
04/11/2016, 16:29 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz I met another polish guy
04/11/2016, 16:29 - Cindy LEUNG: And he's like the same.

04/11/2016, 16:42 - Mom: I think every normal person wud hate communist
04/11/2016, 16:43 - Cindy LEUNG: Hv u talked to a Russian before

05/11/2016, 09:06 - Cindy LEUNG: everytime i go to korean restaurant
05/11/2016, 09:06 - Cindy LEUNG: shin ramen is always the most expensive thing on the menu
05/11/2016, 09:06 - Cindy LEUNG: its more expensive than rice.
05/11/2016, 09:06 - Mom: EVEN MORE THAN MEAT?
05/11/2016, 09:06 - Cindy LEUNG: ramen set was like 7 pounds
05/11/2016, 09:08 - Mom: 7 pounds of ramen is a bit expensive wow
05/11/2016, 09:08 - Cindy LEUNG: yah rite
05/11/2016, 09:09 - Mom: do they charge vat on top of 7 pp?
05/11/2016, 09:09 - Cindy LEUNG: no its usually included
05/11/2016, 09:09 - Cindy LEUNG: shin ramen is an inelastic good?
05/11/2016, 09:10 - Mom: i know in korea, they charge 4000 won for ramen
05/11/2016, 09:10 - Cindy LEUNG: how much is that
05/11/2016, 09:10 - Mom: i think rice is inelastic
05/11/2016, 09:10 - Mom: abt hk$40
05/11/2016, 09:11 - Cindy LEUNG: !!
05/11/2016, 09:11 - Cindy LEUNG: rice is a giffen good
05/11/2016, 09:11 - Cindy LEUNG: its the weird one
05/11/2016, 09:11 - Cindy LEUNG: where people consume more when price goes up
05/11/2016, 09:11 - Mom: err
05/11/2016, 09:12 - Mom: demand increase then price goes up
05/11/2016, 09:12 - Cindy LEUNG: no giffen goods break the law of demand
05/11/2016, 09:13 - Cindy LEUNG: though its debatable whether they even exist
05/11/2016, 09:13 - Cindy LEUNG: and whether rice is a giffen good or not
05/11/2016, 09:13 - Mom: never learnt this giffen food, so don't know
05/11/2016, 09:14 - Cindy LEUNG: ok harvard says rice in hunan is a giffen good
05/11/2016, 09:15 - Cindy LEUNG: ah i see why
05/11/2016, 09:15 - Mom: u forgot ppl in harvard r not normal persons
05/11/2016, 09:15 - Mom: i wonder if they eat rice
05/11/2016, 09:15 - Cindy LEUNG: its a special case where u have very small budget
05/11/2016, 09:15 - Cindy LEUNG: like extreme poverty
05/11/2016, 09:16 - Cindy LEUNG: so even if price of rice goes up, u still substitute any luxury with rice cuz its a staple good.
05/11/2016, 09:17 - Mom: don't understand ah
05/11/2016, 09:18 - Cindy LEUNG: say u eat rice everyday
05/11/2016, 09:18 - Cindy LEUNG: its like ur basic food
05/11/2016, 09:18 - Cindy LEUNG: u won't eat anything else
05/11/2016, 09:18 - Cindy LEUNG: or anything else like meat and veggies are just accessories to rice
05/11/2016, 09:18 - Mom: no substitutes?
05/11/2016, 09:18 - Cindy LEUNG: yea no subs cuz its a staple good
05/11/2016, 09:18 - Mom: noodles, ramen?
05/11/2016, 09:19 - Cindy LEUNG: so if u have money u buy rice first
05/11/2016, 09:19 - Cindy LEUNG: so apparently people in hunan eat rice as a staple part of their diet
05/11/2016, 09:20 - Cindy LEUNG: btw, why are the mando people like obsessed with yakult
05/11/2016, 09:20 - Cindy LEUNG: its like 3 pounds for pack
05/11/2016, 09:20 - Cindy LEUNG: super expensive so i don't buy
05/11/2016, 09:20 - Mom: becoz they mistakenly thought there're good bacteria in yakult
05/11/2016, 09:21 - Cindy LEUNG: so they still think yakult is like some miracle drink?
05/11/2016, 09:21 - Mom: ofc,
05/11/2016, 09:21 - Cindy LEUNG: i just saw a pack of yakult in our fridge.
05/11/2016, 09:22 - Mom: why don't u buy real greek yogurt in uk?
05/11/2016, 09:22 - Cindy LEUNG: yea i do

05/11/2016, 09:23 - Cindy LEUNG: yakult?
05/11/2016, 09:23 - Cindy LEUNG: i don't think so
05/11/2016, 09:23 - Cindy LEUNG: not even the hk ones are made in japan
05/11/2016, 09:24 - Mom: i think there must be changes in their formula over time
05/11/2016, 09:24 - Cindy LEUNG: u mean yakult?
05/11/2016, 09:24 - Mom: yea

05/11/2016, 09:27 - Cindy LEUNG: ucl chem is fine
05/11/2016, 09:27 - Cindy LEUNG: but ucl is very competitive so i think they all probably have bio
05/11/2016, 09:27 - Mom: so chem and bio r must in uk?
05/11/2016, 09:27 - Cindy LEUNG: for med?
05/11/2016, 09:27 - Cindy LEUNG: yea

05/11/2016, 09:29 - Cindy LEUNG: but everyone knows he got into ucl med
05/11/2016, 09:29 - Cindy LEUNG: dude econ is hard
05/11/2016, 09:29 - Mom: c
05/11/2016, 09:30 - Cindy LEUNG: so is finance
05/11/2016, 09:30 - Cindy LEUNG: i think financial engineering must be the hardest eng discipline
05/11/2016, 09:30 - Mom: but economists r not that respectful by public
05/11/2016, 09:30 - Cindy LEUNG: financial product move through TIME
05/11/2016, 09:30 - Mom: financial engrg is not ever an engrg subject
05/11/2016, 09:30 - Cindy LEUNG: that already makes it super hard
05/11/2016, 09:31 - Mom: u have to introduce new products
05/11/2016, 09:31 - Mom: or else u can't fool ppl's money
05/11/2016, 09:31 - Cindy LEUNG: i think by engineering, they just mean there's a like a making and designing aspect to waht u study
05/11/2016, 09:31 - Mom: ok
05/11/2016, 09:31 - Cindy LEUNG: theres this area in economics call mechanism design
05/11/2016, 09:32 - Cindy LEUNG: its like engineering
05/11/2016, 09:32 - Mom: what's it?
05/11/2016, 09:32 - Cindy LEUNG: u design institutional frameworks
05/11/2016, 09:33 - Mom: so they're corporate planner?
05/11/2016, 09:33 - Cindy LEUNG: kind of lah
05/11/2016, 09:33 - Cindy LEUNG: business is just a scaled down version of econ
05/11/2016, 09:33 - Mom: don't know ah
05/11/2016, 09:33 - Cindy LEUNG: sadly nobody study that in lse

05/11/2016, 09:34 - Cindy LEUNG: mechanism design
05/11/2016, 09:34 - Mom: is there mechanism design in lse?
05/11/2016, 09:34 - Cindy LEUNG: no, i don't think so
05/11/2016, 09:34 - Mom: americans r so advance
05/11/2016, 09:35 - Cindy LEUNG: i think its just harvard and those ivies
05/11/2016, 09:35 - Mom: maybe
05/11/2016, 09:35 - Cindy LEUNG: there's more interest in behavioral economics here since the nudge thing
05/11/2016, 09:35 - Mom: after all, there're so many wise men in those unis
05/11/2016, 09:36 - Cindy LEUNG: but i saw the research and people are still in the confused stages
05/11/2016, 09:36 - Cindy LEUNG: yah
05/11/2016, 09:37 - Cindy LEUNG: and then i heard that cambridge is opening up a new field in cybersecurity economics
05/11/2016, 09:37 - Cindy LEUNG: again the lse needs to up its game.....

05/11/2016, 09:37 - Cindy LEUNG: =.=
05/11/2016, 09:37 - Cindy LEUNG: yea but it requires knowledge of computer science
05/11/2016, 09:38 - Cindy LEUNG: lse people are so backward they find excel to be magic
05/11/2016, 09:38 - Cindy LEUNG: so pretty much hopeless.

05/11/2016, 11:40 - Cindy LEUNG: i always feel like the micro lecturer has a lot of grievances

05/11/2016, 11:40 - Cindy LEUNG: and taxes.
05/11/2016, 11:41 - Cindy LEUNG: its like every example is about old people

05/11/2016, 12:29 - Mom: Hmm

06/11/2016, 12:03 - Cindy LEUNG: ok so this is normal courtesy behavior rite?
06/11/2016, 12:03 - Cindy LEUNG: after he left

06/11/2016, 12:03 - Cindy LEUNG: and htne
06/11/2016, 12:04 - Cindy LEUNG: when it got to my floor, they didn't even budge when i tried to get pass them to get out of the lift.

06/11/2016, 12:06 - Cindy LEUNG: i feel like all mainland women are like that here.
06/11/2016, 12:06 - Cindy LEUNG: what the fuck is wrong with them, its like they're all on a manhunt
06/11/2016, 12:07 - Mom: They didnt act like normal human being at that moment, they just ÁôºËä±Áô≤
06/11/2016, 12:07 - Cindy LEUNG: and they treat me like shit just because yea they probably see me as rival
06/11/2016, 12:07 - Mom: They're all like that all over the world, not only in uk
06/11/2016, 12:08 - Mom: That's why ppl used to think women r bitches
06/11/2016, 12:08 - Cindy LEUNG: at least when u talk to the other girls they talk about some normal stuff.
06/11/2016, 12:09 - Mom: No wonder guys treat them as prostitutes
06/11/2016, 12:09 - Cindy LEUNG: yea i feel like they deserve that treatment
06/11/2016, 12:09 - Cindy LEUNG: if they behave like they work in a brothel
06/11/2016, 12:09 - Mom: They definite deserve it
06/11/2016, 12:09 - Cindy LEUNG: seriously.
06/11/2016, 12:10 - Mom: This is also onw reason why i hate them so much
06/11/2016, 12:11 - Cindy LEUNG: i hate how they treat u like shit if u're not a man.
06/11/2016, 12:11 - Mom: Mainlander women r like thay
06/11/2016, 12:12 - Mom: They see every other girl as rival
06/11/2016, 12:12 - Cindy LEUNG: some day i swear i'm gonna tell them to fuck off in the lift and then i'm gonna be branded public enemy no.1 in urbanest.
06/11/2016, 12:14 - Mom: If i were u, i wud try hit them secretly at the moment they block my passage
06/11/2016, 12:14 - Cindy LEUNG: i'm still so fucking angry.

06/11/2016, 12:15 - Cindy LEUNG: u wanna see wat my flatmate's bathroom looks like
06/11/2016, 12:16 - Mom: Do u share the bathroom with them?

06/11/2016, 12:16 - Cindy LEUNG: i share the toilet with the guy
06/11/2016, 12:16 - Mom: Not that bad srsly
06/11/2016, 12:17 - Cindy LEUNG: .....
06/11/2016, 12:17 - Cindy LEUNG: r u sure
06/11/2016, 12:17 - Cindy LEUNG: that is like unacceptable
06/11/2016, 12:17 - Cindy LEUNG: the drain is completely blocked
06/11/2016, 12:17 - Mom: Always rmb they r lower ÈÑâ‰∏ã‰∫∫
06/11/2016, 12:17 - Cindy LEUNG: that girl is from beijing
06/11/2016, 12:18 - Cindy LEUNG: last time we went, i remember they did not live in pigstys
06/11/2016, 12:18 - Mom: i won't feel astonished to see this scenario
06/11/2016, 12:19 - Cindy LEUNG: well yeah i kinda expected that
06/11/2016, 12:19 - Mom: even hongkonger will be like that
06/11/2016, 12:19 - Cindy LEUNG: but she still showers in there every day
06/11/2016, 12:19 - Cindy LEUNG: i don't even want to take one step in there
06/11/2016, 12:19 - Mom: even though they're from beijing, their mind set still at lower level
06/11/2016, 12:19 - Cindy LEUNG: i don't understand how she can still wash her hair
06/11/2016, 12:20 - Cindy LEUNG: without flooding the whole bathroom
06/11/2016, 12:20 - Mom: it's just the outer side changed, not inner thought
06/11/2016, 12:20 - Cindy LEUNG: i was hoping she'd flood the bathroom
06/11/2016, 12:20 - Mom: that's her prob, i won't bother
06/11/2016, 12:20 - Cindy LEUNG: then she will have to get someone from urbanest
06/11/2016, 12:21 - Cindy LEUNG: i'm just waiting to see how bad things have to be to get her to do something about it
06/11/2016, 12:21 - Mom: will she use the bathroom at ur side?
06/11/2016, 12:21 - Cindy LEUNG: no
06/11/2016, 12:21 - Cindy LEUNG: she won't
06/11/2016, 12:21 - Mom: good
06/11/2016, 12:21 - Mom: is it locked?
06/11/2016, 12:21 - Cindy LEUNG: no
06/11/2016, 12:21 - Cindy LEUNG: but she won't use a guy's bathroom
06/11/2016, 12:21 - Mom: then she probably wud use it if hers is blocked srsly
06/11/2016, 12:22 - Cindy LEUNG: no srsly i don't think so
06/11/2016, 12:22 - Mom: then good
06/11/2016, 12:22 - Cindy LEUNG: she'd rather go to her friend's bathroom
06/11/2016, 12:22 - Mom: omg
06/11/2016, 12:22 - Mom: how hateful this behaviour is
06/11/2016, 12:22 - Cindy LEUNG: like there's a lot of behaviors i don't understand
06/11/2016, 12:22 - Mom: to spread the bad things to others, all over the world
06/11/2016, 12:23 - Cindy LEUNG: normal people would like (1) get maintenance to unblock the shower
06/11/2016, 12:23 - Mom: don't be cheated by the name from beijing
06/11/2016, 12:23 - Cindy LEUNG: or (2) if u're a very inconsiderate person, go use the other bathroom
06/11/2016, 12:23 - Mom: mainlanders r used to have very bad hygiene standard
06/11/2016, 12:23 - Cindy LEUNG: yea i get that
06/11/2016, 12:23 - Mom: not to mention moral standard
06/11/2016, 12:23 - Cindy LEUNG: i don't get why she doesn't just ask someone to unblock the shower
06/11/2016, 12:24 - Cindy LEUNG: i'm just waiting to see when she'll do that
06/11/2016, 12:24 - Mom: they thought it's the public asset, don't even bother
06/11/2016, 12:24 - Cindy LEUNG: but she uses it everyday?
06/11/2016, 12:24 - Cindy LEUNG: its pretty much her bathroom, she's the only one who uses it
06/11/2016, 12:24 - Mom: she can go to her friends' place ma
06/11/2016, 12:24 - Cindy LEUNG: and she doesn't have problem with english
06/11/2016, 12:24 - Mom: they don't think so
06/11/2016, 12:25 - Cindy LEUNG: she's the fluent type
06/11/2016, 12:25 - Cindy LEUNG: i've spoken to her before.
06/11/2016, 12:25 - Cindy LEUNG: so
06/11/2016, 12:25 - Cindy LEUNG: i don't get it
06/11/2016, 12:25 - Mom: they don't think they have the responsibility to make thing tidy and clean
06/11/2016, 12:25 - Cindy LEUNG: its not even responsibility
06/11/2016, 12:25 - Cindy LEUNG: its just
06/11/2016, 12:25 - Mom: sigh
06/11/2016, 12:25 - Mom: ur so timid and kind person
06/11/2016, 12:25 - Cindy LEUNG: taking the initiative to make ur life better
06/11/2016, 12:26 - Cindy LEUNG: how am i timid and kind, i went to use the other bathroom.
06/11/2016, 12:26 - Cindy LEUNG: the other guy is a normal person.
06/11/2016, 12:26 - Mom: rmb that mainlanders r rich person, they thought they have the ability to influence or even control other ppl's world
06/11/2016, 12:26 - Cindy LEUNG: yeah but to influence people, u need to tell people to do things right
06/11/2016, 12:26 - Mom: they use money
06/11/2016, 12:27 - Cindy LEUNG: yeah then why doesn't she pay for a cleaner to clean the bathroom?
06/11/2016, 12:27 - Mom: they thought if u have money, u can tell the world to do whatever u want
06/11/2016, 12:27 - Cindy LEUNG: YEAH MY POINT IS U STILL NEED TO TELL PEOPLE WHAT TO DO
06/11/2016, 12:27 - Mom: can't u see what china govt is doing right now?
06/11/2016, 12:27 - Cindy LEUNG: its not like u give them money and people will automatically do what u want
06/11/2016, 12:27 - Cindy LEUNG: this is liek the mindset of a woman
06/11/2016, 12:28 - Cindy LEUNG: nobody's gonna be nice to you if u don't say anything
06/11/2016, 12:28 - Cindy LEUNG: i know that they think they can do anything with money
06/11/2016, 12:28 - Mom: ur too logical in translating mainlanders' mindset
06/11/2016, 12:29 - Cindy LEUNG: i mean urbanest has a responsibility to maintain its own facilities
06/11/2016, 12:29 - Cindy LEUNG: u don't even need money
06/11/2016, 12:29 - Cindy LEUNG: just ask
06/11/2016, 12:29 - Cindy LEUNG: i'm waiting to see what it takes for her to ask
06/11/2016, 12:29 - Mom: the point is she doesn't bother to ask
06/11/2016, 12:29 - Cindy LEUNG: yea i think so too
06/11/2016, 12:29 - Mom: she just let things to get worse
06/11/2016, 12:30 - Cindy LEUNG: so point two
06/11/2016, 12:30 - Cindy LEUNG: why doesn't she switch to our bathroom
06/11/2016, 12:30 - Mom: this is the question?
06/11/2016, 12:30 - Mom: maybe she doesn't like to share things with U
06/11/2016, 12:30 - Cindy LEUNG: no i think she thinks its a man's bathroom
06/11/2016, 12:31 - Mom: hahaha
06/11/2016, 12:31 - Cindy LEUNG: or
06/11/2016, 12:31 - Mom: i don't think so
06/11/2016, 12:31 - Cindy LEUNG: like she's not supposed to use it cuz her room is attached to the disgusting bathroom
06/11/2016, 12:31 - Cindy LEUNG: my room's in the middle, so i can switch
06/11/2016, 12:32 - Cindy LEUNG: i think this is probably more likey.
06/11/2016, 12:32 - Mom: it's so lucky u have a different toilet, or else i can't imagine how angry u wud be
06/11/2016, 12:33 - Cindy LEUNG: erm yeah, then i would have turpentined her ages ago
06/11/2016, 12:33 - Cindy LEUNG: i would pour bleach on her food and she'd never know
06/11/2016, 12:33 - Mom: good idea
06/11/2016, 12:34 - Cindy LEUNG: lol speaking of food
06/11/2016, 12:34 - Cindy LEUNG: the oven tray is disgusting as well
06/11/2016, 12:34 - Cindy LEUNG: there's like a tray which came with teh oven
06/11/2016, 12:34 - Cindy LEUNG: it was covered in oil
06/11/2016, 12:34 - Mom: do u need to share with her?
06/11/2016, 12:34 - Cindy LEUNG: and she just bakes her food in the that
06/11/2016, 12:35 - Cindy LEUNG: no, a normal person would at least use a piece of aluminium foil
06/11/2016, 12:35 - Cindy LEUNG: like u're supposed to
06/11/2016, 12:35 - Cindy LEUNG: i have my own baking tray
06/11/2016, 12:35 - Cindy LEUNG: i dont' get how she can bake her fries in that gutter oil
06/11/2016, 12:36 - Cindy LEUNG: its like she decided to roll her food all over the floor so that its covered in dust before she cooks it
06/11/2016, 12:36 - Cindy LEUNG: it makes no sense to me
06/11/2016, 12:37 - Cindy LEUNG: and there's other things which don't make sense
06/11/2016, 12:38 - Cindy LEUNG: like she doesn't empty the bin but bought herself a little sanitary bin to put in the toilet?
06/11/2016, 12:38 - Cindy LEUNG: and why would u get a door mat for room in a flat?
06/11/2016, 12:39 - Mom: sigh
06/11/2016, 12:39 - Cindy LEUNG: u see how absurd everything is
06/11/2016, 12:39 - Cindy LEUNG: i don't can't comprehend their action
06/11/2016, 12:39 - Mom: just as normal human beings won't understand why a grown up adult wud poo in the public area
06/11/2016, 12:39 - Cindy LEUNG: yea
06/11/2016, 12:40 - Mom: that's china
06/11/2016, 12:40 - Mom: everything is normal
06/11/2016, 12:40 - Cindy LEUNG: or lift up their child so that they can pee midair and let their piss run down the aisle of the train and think that is ok
06/11/2016, 12:40 - Mom: yea
06/11/2016, 12:40 - Mom: that's how they thought and behave
06/11/2016, 12:41 - Cindy LEUNG: and then get ur wife to kneel down on her fours to wipe that shit up and think that is okay as well
06/11/2016, 12:41 - Mom: just on own side
06/11/2016, 12:41 - Mom: won't think of others or public
06/11/2016, 12:41 - Cindy LEUNG: like action 1 and action 2 makes no logical sense
06/11/2016, 12:41 - Cindy LEUNG: if action 1 is true, then we assume they are selfish and disgusting
06/11/2016, 12:41 - Mom: as i said u can't use logical thinking on them
06/11/2016, 12:41 - Cindy LEUNG: but they don't care about their wife
06/11/2016, 12:41 - Cindy LEUNG: wat?
06/11/2016, 12:42 - Mom: i think they don't understand what "selfish" is
06/11/2016, 12:42 - Cindy LEUNG: they care enough for their child to carry it up to pee
06/11/2016, 12:42 - Mom: wow, wife??
06/11/2016, 12:42 - Cindy LEUNG: yeah this is a video i saw on fb
06/11/2016, 12:43 - Cindy LEUNG: the wife of the man who carried the peeing child got down wiped the floor
06/11/2016, 12:43 - Mom: i mean why wud they care abt others?
06/11/2016, 12:43 - Cindy LEUNG: okay assuming they don't care abt others
06/11/2016, 12:43 - Cindy LEUNG: but the man cared enough for his child to help it pee everywhere
06/11/2016, 12:44 - Cindy LEUNG: but he couldn't care enough for his wife to tell her not to go clean it up?
06/11/2016, 12:44 - Mom: ai ya, their kids r their assets, their future their hopes ma
06/11/2016, 12:44 - Cindy LEUNG: its like almost the man did it deliberately to piss everyone off
06/11/2016, 12:44 - Mom: wife is just a servant
06/11/2016, 12:45 - Cindy LEUNG: sigh
06/11/2016, 12:45 - Cindy LEUNG: unfortunately i think that is true
06/11/2016, 12:45 - Cindy LEUNG: i think thats what he was thinking as well.
06/11/2016, 12:46 - Cindy LEUNG: but with the bj girl
06/11/2016, 12:46 - Cindy LEUNG: i seriously do not comprehend half of her actions
06/11/2016, 12:46 - Mom: i won't surprised
06/11/2016, 12:46 - Cindy LEUNG: and i study human behavior =.=
06/11/2016, 12:47 - Mom: sometimes, i wud say even indian girls r more respectful than chinese women
06/11/2016, 12:48 - Cindy LEUNG: omg
06/11/2016, 12:48 - Cindy LEUNG: the indian girl
06/11/2016, 12:48 - Cindy LEUNG: is disgusting as well
06/11/2016, 12:48 - Cindy LEUNG: but at least she wouldn't eat off dirty table
06/11/2016, 12:49 - Cindy LEUNG: she would find a paper towel and wipe off the non-veg
06/11/2016, 12:50 - Cindy LEUNG: at the end of the day, why do people think girls are so clean
06/11/2016, 12:50 - Cindy LEUNG: they are the filthiest creatures i have ever seen.
06/11/2016, 12:50 - Mom: u said the indian girl is from a very rich family, it's reasonable she doesn't do normal kitchen stuff
06/11/2016, 12:51 - Cindy LEUNG: thats true
06/11/2016, 12:51 - Cindy LEUNG: but every chinese person here is loaded
06/11/2016, 12:51 - Mom: but that beijing girl is from normal family, i guess, so her behaviours r rather not logical
06/11/2016, 12:52 - Cindy LEUNG: i'm guessing she might have done a level here
06/11/2016, 12:52 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz she's fluent
06/11/2016, 12:52 - Cindy LEUNG: there's no way u can be fluent if u studied in china
06/11/2016, 12:52 - Mom: maybe she has private english tutor in beijing
06/11/2016, 12:53 - Mom: chinese usually won't go abroad for high school
06/11/2016, 12:53 - Cindy LEUNG: no i met a couple of shanghai people who did a levels here as well
06/11/2016, 12:53 - Mom: hmm
06/11/2016, 12:53 - Mom: i can say not too many
06/11/2016, 12:54 - Cindy LEUNG: yea they're all like super desperate to make white friends
06/11/2016, 12:55 - Mom: they hate their country deep down their mind
06/11/2016, 12:55 - Cindy LEUNG: Not sure abt that
06/11/2016, 12:55 - Cindy LEUNG: Most of them don't know anything abt politics
06/11/2016, 12:56 - Cindy LEUNG: Its quite difficult for them to know given their media is mostly propaganda
06/11/2016, 12:56 - Mom: wow, how wud they know abt politics
06/11/2016, 12:56 - Mom: websites r screened in china
06/11/2016, 12:56 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea exactly
06/11/2016, 12:57 - Mom: they have no proper information abt the world, how wud they form correct value abt the world
06/11/2016, 12:57 - Cindy LEUNG: So I kinda think they don't like HK people because they know HK people don't like them
06/11/2016, 12:57 - Cindy LEUNG: And they don't know why
06/11/2016, 12:58 - Cindy LEUNG: Ofc there's also the ccp fanning the flames
06/11/2016, 12:59 - Mom: sigh
06/11/2016, 13:02 - Cindy LEUNG: and then there's a lot of hk people who don't know why they're supposed to hate them and just see that the opposition movement as troublemkaers
06/11/2016, 13:03 - Cindy LEUNG: and then there's the people doing weird stupid things like waving the british colony flag around
06/11/2016, 13:04 - Mom: yea, ur right
06/11/2016, 13:04 - Mom: those ppl waving british colony flag around r stupid
06/11/2016, 13:05 - Cindy LEUNG: and then there's also the people who are paid to spread pro-CCP msg, but unfortunately no one gave them a script so nobody knows wtf they are saying, and they just confuse all the stupid people
06/11/2016, 13:05 - Mom: some of the ppl who hate the opposition movement ppl might be spies from china
06/11/2016, 13:05 - Mom: yea, this is hong kong now
06/11/2016, 13:06 - Mom: a group of ppl intentionally make these confusion happened
06/11/2016, 13:06 - Cindy LEUNG: and then suddenly u got a group of radical young people who think they know what they're doing coming out
06/11/2016, 13:06 - Mom: then they can get benefits from it
06/11/2016, 13:07 - Cindy LEUNG: and then the CCP actually gets worried so they send out the cops; everything starts to get violent. that scares the business people and the stupid people and suddenly everyone in hk is against the opposition movement. suddenly there is an opposition mvmt.
06/11/2016, 13:08 - Mom: this is real politics which ur doing the degree
06/11/2016, 13:08 - Mom: don't u find exciting
06/11/2016, 13:08 - Mom: u pick the best subject a the best time
06/11/2016, 13:08 - Cindy LEUNG: and then on social media more hk people post shit about mainlanders, mainlanders post shit about hk people. media capitalizes on this story cuz that's all they do these days, when the hk people aren't even talking about the same mainlanders on weibo.
06/11/2016, 13:09 - Mom: u can have a real touch of politics and see its effect on economy
06/11/2016, 13:09 - Cindy LEUNG: no i do boring stuff like elections
06/11/2016, 13:09 - Cindy LEUNG: western politics is still mainly left and right and their institutions are set up so stupid people cannot overrule the country.
06/11/2016, 13:09 - Mom: u need to learn the basic first
06/11/2016, 13:10 - Cindy LEUNG: right ok
06/11/2016, 13:10 - Cindy LEUNG: i get onto the recent legco election now
06/11/2016, 13:10 - Mom: u know what's happening in legco now/
06/11/2016, 13:10 - Mom: those two young guys
06/11/2016, 13:11 - Mom: prob on declaration
06/11/2016, 13:11 - Cindy LEUNG: i know the youngspiration duo
06/11/2016, 13:11 - Mom: i thought u don't watch news
06/11/2016, 13:11 - Cindy LEUNG: my facebook
06/11/2016, 13:11 - Mom: oh, ic
06/11/2016, 13:11 - Cindy LEUNG: what the hell the lawyers doing
06/11/2016, 13:12 - Cindy LEUNG: now they actually triggered a reinterpretation of the basic law we are screwed
06/11/2016, 13:12 - Mom: they're having a protest tmr in central
06/11/2016, 13:12 - Cindy LEUNG: yeah ok, we have protest everyday in london
06/11/2016, 13:12 - Cindy LEUNG: not that that makes any difference
06/11/2016, 13:13 - Mom: this is the 5th time ccp interpreting the basic law, not a surprise
06/11/2016, 13:13 - Cindy LEUNG: oh really
06/11/2016, 13:13 - Mom: still a lot coming, i guess
06/11/2016, 13:14 - Cindy LEUNG: i feel like this all happened cuz China tried to recolonize HK
06/11/2016, 13:14 - Cindy LEUNG: and it failed
06/11/2016, 13:14 - Mom: the basic law actually is written to be interpreted by the current governing body, so i don't feel any surprise
06/11/2016, 13:15 - Cindy LEUNG: i see
06/11/2016, 13:15 - Mom: how to say? recolonize?
06/11/2016, 13:16 - Cindy LEUNG: yeah like chinese colonization
06/11/2016, 13:16 - Cindy LEUNG: i mean if u think of hk people as culturally different people
06/11/2016, 13:16 - Cindy LEUNG: yeah i would say its a colonization
06/11/2016, 13:16 - Mom: i think china is like a traditional chinese parent who want to exert 100% control over their kids
06/11/2016, 13:16 - Cindy LEUNG: its like how they colonized tibet
06/11/2016, 13:17 - Cindy LEUNG: and then if they have time they might colonize manchuria again
06/11/2016, 13:17 - Cindy LEUNG: hahaha
06/11/2016, 13:17 - Mom: but now the kids having influenced by western culture want little bit freedom, and chinese parent thought it unacceptable and a shame on their kids leaning to western culture
06/11/2016, 13:17 - Cindy LEUNG: and then that would anger putin and the chechen terrorists
06/11/2016, 13:18 - Cindy LEUNG: i think china is just lucky right now that they don't have to deal with terrorists.
06/11/2016, 13:18 - Cindy LEUNG: that's the advantage they have
06/11/2016, 13:18 - Mom: yea
06/11/2016, 13:18 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz dealing with ISIS costs a lot of resources
06/11/2016, 13:19 - Cindy LEUNG: and chinese mentality is to be isolationist -- so they hide in the corner and knock out all the smaller kids while the big guys US, Russia, EU deal with the crazy kid
06/11/2016, 13:19 - Mom: why isis just do harms on europe and americans?
06/11/2016, 13:19 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz bush
06/11/2016, 13:20 - Mom: sigh
06/11/2016, 13:20 - Cindy LEUNG: sigh its a long story
06/11/2016, 13:20 - Mom: i get it
06/11/2016, 13:21 - Cindy LEUNG: basically cuz the americans took down a dictator in that region in the name of democracy when they actually wanted to loot their oil. and now they failed to set up a proper government before they left so now its in the hands of terrorists
06/11/2016, 13:21 - Mom: sigh
06/11/2016, 13:22 - Cindy LEUNG: and the europeans are involved cuz they gave the ok and helped invade the place
06/11/2016, 13:22 - Mom: cuz they want to share the profits ma
06/11/2016, 13:22 - Cindy LEUNG: actually i don't know how russians are invovled
06/11/2016, 13:24 - Cindy LEUNG: but the russians have been taking more aggressive military policy so the west is scared of them again
06/11/2016, 13:24 - Cindy LEUNG: mean while they think china is cool cuz they eat rice and trade stuff with them
06/11/2016, 13:25 - Cindy LEUNG: lol people actually still think china is a thriving ground for business
06/11/2016, 13:25 - Cindy LEUNG: i am not joking
06/11/2016, 13:25 - Mom: who think so?
06/11/2016, 13:26 - Cindy LEUNG: like stupid people
06/11/2016, 13:27 - Cindy LEUNG: the global situation is so confusing, with the media these days, its hard to know what exactly the situation is
06/11/2016, 13:28 - Mom: this makes me remember the Revelation described in bible
06/11/2016, 13:28 - Mom: like approaching the end of the world
06/11/2016, 13:28 - Cindy LEUNG: er..
06/11/2016, 13:28 - Cindy LEUNG: i dunno
06/11/2016, 13:28 - Cindy LEUNG: maybe
06/11/2016, 13:29 - Cindy LEUNG: on tuesday, the americans will elect a crazy man or a crook as president.
06/11/2016, 13:29 - Mom: u surely don't believe in god, but the confusion is like what's written in revelation
06/11/2016, 13:29 - Cindy LEUNG: ok u go study that chapter inside out
06/11/2016, 13:29 - Mom: who wud u vote if u could?
06/11/2016, 13:29 - Cindy LEUNG: to see if we can forecast anything
06/11/2016, 13:29 - Cindy LEUNG: idk both are as bad
06/11/2016, 13:30 - Mom: initially i don't hate Hiliary, but now i do have reservation abt her
06/11/2016, 13:30 - Cindy LEUNG: huh i watched the bengzhai inquiry
06/11/2016, 13:30 - Cindy LEUNG: so i have different thoughts
06/11/2016, 13:30 - Cindy LEUNG: she's definitely got a lot of shady shit
06/11/2016, 13:31 - Mom: i think so too
06/11/2016, 13:31 - Cindy LEUNG: basically the us government is going through crisis
06/11/2016, 13:32 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz congress is also a piece of shit
06/11/2016, 13:32 - Mom: use of private email on govt services is totally unacceptable
06/11/2016, 13:33 - Mom: yea, i can't see anything particular good things done with the obama govt
06/11/2016, 13:35 - Cindy LEUNG: and now we see how the british government is also going through crisis
06/11/2016, 13:35 - Mom: üòûüòûüòû
06/11/2016, 13:35 - Mom: do u think of any chance that brexit wud be ruled out?
06/11/2016, 13:36 - Cindy LEUNG: i dunno
06/11/2016, 13:36 - Cindy LEUNG: may thinks she can overrule court decision
06/11/2016, 13:36 - Cindy LEUNG: soo..
06/11/2016, 13:36 - Mom: how's ppl in london react to the court's decision?
06/11/2016, 13:37 - Cindy LEUNG: i don't think people think much of brexit now
06/11/2016, 13:37 - Cindy LEUNG: just like something they need to get on with
06/11/2016, 13:37 - Mom: Somtimes, i think May is so Èú∏ÈÅì
06/11/2016, 13:38 - Cindy LEUNG: i feel like this is starting to look like the great depression again
06/11/2016, 13:38 - Mom: wow, great depression
06/11/2016, 13:38 - Mom: how come u have this impression?
06/11/2016, 13:38 - Cindy LEUNG: yeah so individual countries had a lot of internal domestic problems post ww1
06/11/2016, 13:38 - Mom: so what shud we keep? cash or assets?
06/11/2016, 13:39 - Cindy LEUNG: and then the wall street market crashes out of nowhere
06/11/2016, 13:40 - Mom: omg
06/11/2016, 13:40 - Cindy LEUNG: yeah lack of collective security
06/11/2016, 13:40 - Mom: how can i keep my little wealth
06/11/2016, 13:40 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz countries had to deal with their own shit, so everybody starts to revert to realpolitik
06/11/2016, 13:40 - Mom: üò©üò©
06/11/2016, 13:41 - Cindy LEUNG: start a hedgefund. hedge like there's no tomorrow
06/11/2016, 13:41 - Mom: how? no tmr?
06/11/2016, 13:42 - Mom: if no tmr, u got to spend all u have to maximize ur utilities now rite?
06/11/2016, 13:42 - Cindy LEUNG: yeah
06/11/2016, 13:42 - Cindy LEUNG: look at more short term investments
06/11/2016, 13:42 - Cindy LEUNG: max consumption today
06/11/2016, 13:42 - Cindy LEUNG: so borrow
06/11/2016, 13:42 - Mom: hmm
06/11/2016, 13:43 - Cindy LEUNG: should have gone to northwestern then....
06/11/2016, 13:44 - Cindy LEUNG: üòÖ
06/11/2016, 13:44 - Mom: sigh
06/11/2016, 13:44 - Mom: will they accept 3rd yr transfer in?
06/11/2016, 13:45 - Cindy LEUNG: lol
06/11/2016, 13:45 - Cindy LEUNG: why would i transfer in 3rd year
06/11/2016, 13:45 - Mom: then u cud spend all ur money
06/11/2016, 13:46 - Cindy LEUNG: hmm
06/11/2016, 13:47 - Cindy LEUNG: no point
06/11/2016, 13:47 - Cindy LEUNG: i got used to lse
06/11/2016, 13:47 - Cindy LEUNG: i watched the finance lecture yesterday
06/11/2016, 13:47 - Cindy LEUNG: from mit
06/11/2016, 13:47 - Cindy LEUNG: and it was a graduate level course
06/11/2016, 13:48 - Cindy LEUNG: i think lse's course is slightly harder imo
06/11/2016, 13:48 - Mom: why lse's course r so hard?
06/11/2016, 13:48 - Cindy LEUNG: dunno
06/11/2016, 13:48 - Cindy LEUNG: like the content is the same, but lse teaches it at twice the speed
06/11/2016, 13:49 - Mom: this is not fair to lse undergrad cuz their grades were distorted in this circumstances
06/11/2016, 13:50 - Cindy LEUNG: yea
06/11/2016, 13:51 - Cindy LEUNG: but most employers know that since they're likely to be from the lse
07/11/2016, 01:00 - Cindy LEUNG: hi
07/11/2016, 01:01 - Cindy LEUNG: hihi
07/11/2016, 01:02 - Mom: Hi
07/11/2016, 01:02 - Mom: Sup
07/11/2016, 01:02 - Cindy LEUNG: i have exciting news
07/11/2016, 01:02 - Mom: ?
07/11/2016, 01:02 - Cindy LEUNG: finally identified my 'collapses'
07/11/2016, 01:02 - Cindy LEUNG: to be probably mini seizures
07/11/2016, 01:04 - Cindy LEUNG: i forced a med student to look at my condition
07/11/2016, 01:04 - Mom: What mini seizures?
07/11/2016, 01:04 - Cindy LEUNG: like cataplexy
07/11/2016, 01:04 - Cindy LEUNG: the 'cataplexy'
07/11/2016, 01:05 - Mom: i know what ur talking abt?
07/11/2016, 01:05 - Mom: i'm asking why mini seizures and how does that happen?
07/11/2016, 01:05 - Cindy LEUNG: my brain short circuits
07/11/2016, 01:06 - Cindy LEUNG: and then reboots itself
07/11/2016, 01:06 - Cindy LEUNG: apparently
07/11/2016, 01:06 - Mom: ur brain short circuits?
07/11/2016, 01:06 - Mom: in what aspect and how?
07/11/2016, 01:06 - Cindy LEUNG: like there are these things called brain storms
07/11/2016, 01:06 - Mom: why related to emotions?
07/11/2016, 01:07 - Cindy LEUNG: i think its cuz when i feel certain types of emotions my brain is overstimulated.
07/11/2016, 01:07 - Mom: what?
07/11/2016, 01:08 - Cindy LEUNG: so i was correct that what i've been experiencing where seizures
07/11/2016, 01:08 - Mom: but ur collapse is just triggered by slight humorous emotion
07/11/2016, 01:08 - Cindy LEUNG: there's two parts
07/11/2016, 01:08 - Cindy LEUNG: there's the type where i find something humourous and fall down
07/11/2016, 01:09 - Cindy LEUNG: the type where i'm looking at the computer and suddenly i go into paralysis from arms to upper torso
07/11/2016, 01:10 - Mom: what's the triggering point when u looked at the computer?
07/11/2016, 01:10 - Cindy LEUNG: usually nothing
07/11/2016, 01:10 - Cindy LEUNG: i dunno it just happens
07/11/2016, 01:10 - Cindy LEUNG: oh
07/11/2016, 01:10 - Cindy LEUNG: but i'm looking at something which causes my brain to go tingly
07/11/2016, 01:11 - Cindy LEUNG: like my brain goes tingly when i read shoujo manga
07/11/2016, 01:12 - Cindy LEUNG: lol
07/11/2016, 01:12 - Mom: so, how to treat?
07/11/2016, 01:12 - Cindy LEUNG: saah
07/11/2016, 01:12 - Cindy LEUNG: still working on that one
07/11/2016, 01:12 - Cindy LEUNG: he says as long as i don't fall and hit my head its fine
07/11/2016, 01:13 - Mom: do u need anti-seizure drug?
07/11/2016, 01:13 - Cindy LEUNG: dunno
07/11/2016, 01:14 - Cindy LEUNG: i mean he said he didn't know after that
07/11/2016, 01:14 - Mom: hmm
07/11/2016, 01:14 - Mom: still taking taurine?
07/11/2016, 01:14 - Cindy LEUNG: yea
07/11/2016, 01:14 - Mom: good
07/11/2016, 01:14 - Cindy LEUNG: dude the supplements are pointless
07/11/2016, 01:15 - Mom: i mean taurine is good for calming ur emotion
07/11/2016, 01:15 - Cindy LEUNG: when u have an epileptic seizure its pretty much pointless
07/11/2016, 01:15 - Cindy LEUNG: i think my options right now are
07/11/2016, 01:15 - Mom: i just don't understand why and how u get those seizures?
07/11/2016, 01:15 - Cindy LEUNG: to take mood stabilizer
07/11/2016, 01:15 - Cindy LEUNG: i.e. the venlaflaxine
07/11/2016, 01:16 - Cindy LEUNG: or just fall once a day
07/11/2016, 01:16 - Cindy LEUNG: probably genetic
07/11/2016, 01:16 - Mom: sigh genetic again
07/11/2016, 01:17 - Mom: i won't get this conclusion until proof
07/11/2016, 01:17 - Cindy LEUNG: then easy
07/11/2016, 01:17 - Cindy LEUNG: just get genes sequenced
07/11/2016, 01:17 - Mom: how much?
07/11/2016, 01:17 - Cindy LEUNG: i think its plausible that i had mutation of some form
07/11/2016, 01:18 - Cindy LEUNG: that's why i have sort of a weird strain of epilepsy
07/11/2016, 01:19 - Cindy LEUNG: like i've noticed for a long time that i had a lot of symptoms similar to epilepsy
07/11/2016, 01:19 - Mom: i won't agree with the genetic advocate at this moment
07/11/2016, 01:19 - Cindy LEUNG: but then i guess narcolepsy is also sort of similar to epilepsy
07/11/2016, 01:19 - Mom: when u were a kid?
07/11/2016, 01:19 - Cindy LEUNG: no i mean since last year
07/11/2016, 01:20 - Mom: if epilepsy, i think anti-epileptic drug is more appropriate than effecxor
07/11/2016, 01:21 - Cindy LEUNG: my point is that its not fully epilepsy
07/11/2016, 01:21 - Cindy LEUNG: its like a mutated strain of it.
07/11/2016, 01:21 - Cindy LEUNG: like a spin-off version
07/11/2016, 01:23 - Mom: so what's ur plan abt ur findings?
07/11/2016, 01:24 - Cindy LEUNG: saah i just feel reassured that now i know that they are seizures
07/11/2016, 01:24 - Cindy LEUNG: so i was fucking right.
07/11/2016, 01:24 - Cindy LEUNG: they felt like a seizure and they were seizure
07/11/2016, 01:24 - Cindy LEUNG: i'm not fainting or blacking out
07/11/2016, 01:24 - Cindy LEUNG: or syncope
07/11/2016, 01:25 - Mom: o
07/11/2016, 01:25 - Mom: ok
07/11/2016, 01:25 - Mom: then go to GP ask if they can prescribe u anti-seizure drug?
07/11/2016, 01:26 - Cindy LEUNG: well then i need to go to GP
07/11/2016, 01:26 - Cindy LEUNG: and then tell them that i have this weird seizure thing
07/11/2016, 01:26 - Cindy LEUNG: and then what they prescribe is up to them
07/11/2016, 01:26 - Mom: ofc la if u want med
07/11/2016, 01:26 - Cindy LEUNG: or up to the algo
07/11/2016, 01:26 - Mom: what they diagnosis is another issue which u can't control
07/11/2016, 01:27 - Mom: they might have different diagnosis in the end
07/11/2016, 01:27 - Cindy LEUNG: apparently they diagnose according to an algo
07/11/2016, 01:27 - Cindy LEUNG: and a flowchart
07/11/2016, 01:27 - Cindy LEUNG: so obviously sleep problems were not part of the flowchart
07/11/2016, 01:27 - Mom: sure, becoz they're trained in that way
07/11/2016, 01:27 - Cindy LEUNG: yes its called differential diagnosis
07/11/2016, 01:28 - Cindy LEUNG: so now i can anticipate what they say
07/11/2016, 01:28 - Cindy LEUNG: great
07/11/2016, 01:29 - Mom: don't be so excited atm, they might come up with different thing
07/11/2016, 01:29 - Cindy LEUNG: like what
07/11/2016, 01:29 - Mom: dunno
07/11/2016, 01:30 - Mom: just a contingent plan not to be frustrated with unexpected outcome
07/11/2016, 01:31 - Mom: this is kind of creating an emotional safe place for urself
07/11/2016, 01:31 - Cindy LEUNG: so this afternoon
07/11/2016, 01:31 - Mom: collapse again?
07/11/2016, 01:31 - Cindy LEUNG: no i collapsed after dinner
07/11/2016, 01:31 - Cindy LEUNG: but
07/11/2016, 01:31 - Cindy LEUNG: i was sitting in front of my computer
07/11/2016, 01:31 - Cindy LEUNG: and i was coding
07/11/2016, 01:31 - Cindy LEUNG: and then
07/11/2016, 01:32 - Cindy LEUNG: i submitted my file
07/11/2016, 01:32 - Cindy LEUNG: and then i heard my computer make a weirrd noise
07/11/2016, 01:32 - Cindy LEUNG: like a bunch of leprechauns singing a weird song
07/11/2016, 01:33 - Cindy LEUNG: so at first i was like, why did coursera choose such a weird creepy sound effect
07/11/2016, 01:33 - Cindy LEUNG: and then i was like, right i'm fucking hallucinating
07/11/2016, 01:33 - Cindy LEUNG: and then i went into a seizure
07/11/2016, 01:34 - Cindy LEUNG: it's scarier when it happens at night.
07/11/2016, 01:35 - Cindy LEUNG: hello response?
07/11/2016, 01:36 - Cindy LEUNG: sigh
07/11/2016, 01:36 - Cindy LEUNG: i'm gonna go shower, not dead
07/11/2016, 01:38 - Mom: here
07/11/2016, 01:39 - Mom: reading ur lines
07/11/2016, 01:43 - Mom: toilet time again
07/11/2016, 02:00 - Cindy LEUNG: hi
07/11/2016, 02:00 - Mom: hi
07/11/2016, 02:01 - Mom: what made u collapse after dinner?
07/11/2016, 02:01 - Mom: shower already?
07/11/2016, 02:01 - Cindy LEUNG: i laughed
07/11/2016, 02:01 - Cindy LEUNG: yea i'm back
07/11/2016, 02:01 - Mom: ic
07/11/2016, 02:01 - Cindy LEUNG: i think i collapsed so much more in yr13
07/11/2016, 02:01 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz of the TCM
07/11/2016, 02:01 - Cindy LEUNG: not to blame anyone
07/11/2016, 02:01 - Mom: why?
07/11/2016, 02:02 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz i suppressed my hr
07/11/2016, 02:02 - Cindy LEUNG: that suppressed my HR
07/11/2016, 02:02 - Mom: ok
07/11/2016, 02:02 - Cindy LEUNG: and my condition already affected my heart
07/11/2016, 02:02 - Mom: is ur HR normal again?
07/11/2016, 02:02 - Cindy LEUNG: i dunno
07/11/2016, 02:02 - Cindy LEUNG: yea normally it is ok
07/11/2016, 02:03 - Cindy LEUNG: but it just slows down when i go weak
07/11/2016, 02:03 - Cindy LEUNG: which its not really supposed to do
07/11/2016, 02:03 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz the heart's muscles are independent from skeletal muscle
07/11/2016, 02:03 - Mom: is there any way to strengthen ur heart conditon again?
07/11/2016, 02:03 - Cindy LEUNG: but that seems to happen to epileptic people so i think its just the condition
07/11/2016, 02:04 - Cindy LEUNG: there's nothing wrong with my heart
07/11/2016, 02:04 - Cindy LEUNG: my heart is super strong given the amount i can drink
07/11/2016, 02:04 - Mom: err...
07/11/2016, 02:05 - Mom: is it time to sleep now?
07/11/2016, 02:05 - Cindy LEUNG: i already slept for 2 hrs before talking to you
07/11/2016, 02:05 - Mom: omg
07/11/2016, 02:06 - Mom: ur probably need sleep only at 4 rite?
07/11/2016, 02:06 - Mom: this is not good ah
07/11/2016, 02:06 - Cindy LEUNG: i guess
07/11/2016, 02:06 - Mom: it hurts ur normal regulating cycle
07/11/2016, 02:06 - Cindy LEUNG: i only need to sleep if i start hearing things or seeing green
07/11/2016, 02:07 - Mom: OMG !!
07/11/2016, 02:07 - Mom: ur conditioned
07/11/2016, 02:07 - Cindy LEUNG: erm no
07/11/2016, 02:07 - Cindy LEUNG: that's psychology
07/11/2016, 02:08 - Cindy LEUNG: im kidding
07/11/2016, 02:08 - Mom: err
07/11/2016, 02:09 - Cindy LEUNG: i'd probably fall asleep automatically if i see green or hear stuff
07/11/2016, 02:09 - Cindy LEUNG: usually they're followed by seizure events
07/11/2016, 02:09 - Mom: how often do u hear stuff?
07/11/2016, 02:09 - Cindy LEUNG: not very much
07/11/2016, 02:10 - Cindy LEUNG: i see green much more often
07/11/2016, 02:10 - Mom: did those seizure incidents take long time to end?
07/11/2016, 02:10 - Cindy LEUNG: no
07/11/2016, 02:10 - Cindy LEUNG: they're like rem episodes
07/11/2016, 02:10 - Cindy LEUNG: end within 20 mins
07/11/2016, 02:10 - Mom: see
07/11/2016, 02:11 - Mom: 20 mins ??
07/11/2016, 02:11 - Mom: i thought it lasted as short as 30 sec
07/11/2016, 02:11 - Cindy LEUNG: what rem episode?
07/11/2016, 02:11 - Cindy LEUNG: no
07/11/2016, 02:11 - Cindy LEUNG: u mean seizure incident right?
07/11/2016, 02:11 - Cindy LEUNG: cataplexy is within 30 sec
07/11/2016, 02:11 - Mom: i mean just the seizure portion
07/11/2016, 02:11 - Cindy LEUNG: hmm
07/11/2016, 02:12 - Cindy LEUNG: then i wouldn't know
07/11/2016, 02:12 - Cindy LEUNG: i'm in a confused state
07/11/2016, 02:12 - Cindy LEUNG: how can i track time
07/11/2016, 02:12 - Mom: u had seizure event and then fell into rem sleep?
07/11/2016, 02:12 - Cindy LEUNG: everytime i ask people, they just tell me i feel asleep
07/11/2016, 02:12 - Mom: ok
07/11/2016, 02:12 - Cindy LEUNG: no sometimes its like seizure all the way
07/11/2016, 02:13 - Mom: but can u hear ur friends talking at the same time?
07/11/2016, 02:13 - Cindy LEUNG: i feel intense activity in my head for a while
07/11/2016, 02:13 - Cindy LEUNG: u mean actually hear? or hallucinating?
07/11/2016, 02:13 - Mom: actual?
07/11/2016, 02:13 - Cindy LEUNG: i'm not around my friends
07/11/2016, 02:13 - Cindy LEUNG: seizures happen when i'm alone
07/11/2016, 02:13 - Cindy LEUNG: unless its cataplexy type
07/11/2016, 02:13 - Mom: background sound?
07/11/2016, 02:14 - Cindy LEUNG: no, when u get a seizure the internal stimulation is very intense
07/11/2016, 02:14 - Mom: seizures don't happen with others around?
07/11/2016, 02:14 - Cindy LEUNG: no
07/11/2016, 02:15 - Cindy LEUNG: basically because there is like a storm happening inside my head, i don't really sense stuff from outside
07/11/2016, 02:15 - Mom: ok
07/11/2016, 02:15 - Mom: i guess eeg is able to detect these incidents
07/11/2016, 02:15 - Cindy LEUNG: yea but i did two eegs and they didn't find seizure patterns
07/11/2016, 02:15 - Cindy LEUNG: which is weird
07/11/2016, 02:16 - Mom: perhaps u need more sophisticated eeg detection
07/11/2016, 02:17 - Cindy LEUNG: there are some seizures which are undetectable
07/11/2016, 02:18 - Mom: urs can be classified as non-epileptic seizure which can't be detected by normal eeg, i guess
07/11/2016, 02:20 - Cindy LEUNG: yea
07/11/2016, 02:20 - Cindy LEUNG: i've been wondering if i'm getting partial seizures
07/11/2016, 02:20 - Cindy LEUNG: which would explain the migraine like symptoms
07/11/2016, 02:21 - Mom: we don't know until confirmed by testing
07/11/2016, 02:21 - Cindy LEUNG: thats true
07/11/2016, 02:21 - Cindy LEUNG: i really think i should just go see nhs now
07/11/2016, 02:21 - Cindy LEUNG: as long as they don't put narcolepsy on my profile, i'm fine with that
07/11/2016, 02:22 - Mom: but is epilepsy a good diagnosis?
07/11/2016, 02:22 - Mom: ru still considering medical path?
07/11/2016, 02:22 - Cindy LEUNG: no
07/11/2016, 02:22 - Mom: k
07/11/2016, 02:22 - Cindy LEUNG: i rather have epilepsy than narcolepsy
07/11/2016, 02:23 - Cindy LEUNG: narcolepsy is like medically proven laziness or something
07/11/2016, 02:23 - Cindy LEUNG: people will never understand a sleeping disorder
07/11/2016, 02:23 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz they cannot comprehend a different type of fatigue
07/11/2016, 02:23 - Mom: yea
07/11/2016, 02:24 - Cindy LEUNG: i mean even the medical community are still debating whether sleeping problems exist.
07/11/2016, 02:24 - Cindy LEUNG: so by the time they finish debating i'll be dead already
07/11/2016, 02:25 - Mom: in fact, sleeping isn't a problem
07/11/2016, 02:25 - Mom: it's only symptoms of some other problems
07/11/2016, 02:25 - Cindy LEUNG: yea
07/11/2016, 02:26 - Mom: but be very careful when talking to those GP cuz they might have pre-disposition
07/11/2016, 02:26 - Cindy LEUNG: i think they'll just send me to a neurologist
07/11/2016, 02:27 - Cindy LEUNG: and then i'll become some neurologist's passion project like the med student said
07/11/2016, 02:27 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz i'm not in critical situation
07/11/2016, 02:27 - Mom: then u need to wait ?
07/11/2016, 02:27 - Cindy LEUNG: saa maybe
07/11/2016, 02:28 - Mom: sigh
07/11/2016, 02:28 - Cindy LEUNG: i'll just go to gp and see what thy say first
07/11/2016, 02:28 - Mom: nhs is like hk public health, totally confusion
07/11/2016, 02:28 - Mom: k
07/11/2016, 02:28 - Cindy LEUNG: they lack funding
07/11/2016, 02:29 - Cindy LEUNG: and u know everything in uk is super inefficient
07/11/2016, 02:29 - Cindy LEUNG: so there's so much wastage
07/11/2016, 02:29 - Mom: that's where taxes gone
07/11/2016, 02:30 - Cindy LEUNG: taxes is even more messed up
07/11/2016, 02:30 - Cindy LEUNG: poor people actually pay more taxes relative to the rich
07/11/2016, 02:32 - Mom: so try every step not falling into the poor group
07/11/2016, 02:32 - Cindy LEUNG: its not like those people asked to be poor
07/11/2016, 02:34 - Mom: i mean try not to become part of the poor by ways of increasing ur job skill or whatever
07/11/2016, 02:35 - Cindy LEUNG: i think u're just born into a class these days tbh
07/11/2016, 02:35 - Mom: too sad
07/11/2016, 02:36 - Cindy LEUNG: like those people were born into circumstances which systematically disadvantaged them
07/11/2016, 02:37 - Mom: yea
07/11/2016, 02:37 - Mom: so sad
07/11/2016, 02:39 - Cindy LEUNG: fuck the world
07/11/2016, 02:39 - Mom: u need to learn controlling ur emotion
07/11/2016, 02:39 - Cindy LEUNG: no i thnk i just needa take mood stabilizers
07/11/2016, 02:40 - Cindy LEUNG: i mean they help u reach this zen state of feeling nothing
07/11/2016, 02:40 - Cindy LEUNG: that's basically what i try to do everyday by avoiding people
07/11/2016, 02:40 - Mom: then become an idiot?
07/11/2016, 02:40 - Cindy LEUNG: u don't become an idiot
07/11/2016, 02:41 - Cindy LEUNG: u just don't feel anything
07/11/2016, 02:41 - Mom: but u can't denial its physical side effect
07/11/2016, 02:42 - Cindy LEUNG: whats the physical side effect?
07/11/2016, 02:42 - Mom: they affect ur other organs indeed
07/11/2016, 02:42 - Cindy LEUNG: i guess, people have different problems with them though
07/11/2016, 02:43 - Cindy LEUNG: i mean at the end of teh day, i understand why they prescribed that to me
07/11/2016, 02:43 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz i can't fix my seizures
07/11/2016, 02:44 - Mom: u mean the effecxor?
07/11/2016, 02:44 - Cindy LEUNG: yeah its probably a mood stabilizer
07/11/2016, 02:44 - Mom: but they don't see u having seizure wow
07/11/2016, 02:44 - Mom: they just prescribe drugs according to their "sky book"
07/11/2016, 02:45 - Cindy LEUNG: yeah its called differential diagnosis
07/11/2016, 02:45 - Cindy LEUNG: they use a flow chart
07/11/2016, 02:45 - Cindy LEUNG: and algos
07/11/2016, 02:45 - Mom: the ur diagnosis is "narco" instead of 'epilepsy" according to their flowchart rite?
07/11/2016, 02:46 - Cindy LEUNG: well i have a mental condition
07/11/2016, 02:46 - Cindy LEUNG: so its difficult to diagnose
07/11/2016, 02:46 - Cindy LEUNG: but i doubt the nhs will diagnose me as narco here
07/11/2016, 02:47 - Cindy LEUNG: they're so reluctant to go to those conclusions
07/11/2016, 02:47 - Cindy LEUNG: and i don't have the sleep symptoms of narco
07/11/2016, 02:48 - Cindy LEUNG: i mean tbh, none of the neurologists we went to were convinced i had narco anyways
07/11/2016, 02:48 - Mom: no, they're convinced by the SLMT
07/11/2016, 02:49 - Cindy LEUNG: mslt
07/11/2016, 02:49 - Mom: they just made their diagnosis according to that test
07/11/2016, 02:49 - Mom: i'm having srs headache, so i can't think rather properly
07/11/2016, 02:49 - Cindy LEUNG: ok
07/11/2016, 02:50 - Cindy LEUNG: take a panadol
07/11/2016, 02:50 - Mom: already

07/11/2016, 02:51 - Cindy LEUNG: why's everybody sick these days
07/11/2016, 02:51 - Mom: maybe having cold or flu
07/11/2016, 02:52 - Mom: not sure, just after a whole night of being exposed to that direct blowing air-cond
07/11/2016, 02:52 - Cindy LEUNG: yea

07/11/2016, 17:00 - Mom: Hi
07/11/2016, 17:01 - Mom: I advise not to take effexor as a mood stablizer for treating ur seizure
07/11/2016, 17:02 - Mom: It might actually trigger more  severe seizures when i googled online
07/11/2016, 17:29 - Cindy LEUNG: I'm so tired today
07/11/2016, 17:30 - Cindy LEUNG: My brain basically did no work
07/11/2016, 17:30 - Cindy LEUNG: On period finally
07/11/2016, 17:30 - Mom: Why?
07/11/2016, 17:30 - Mom: No sleep last night?

07/11/2016, 17:32 - Cindy LEUNG: I basically want to fall asleep when I sit down today
07/11/2016, 17:32 - Cindy LEUNG: Yes
07/11/2016, 17:33 - Mom: I think it's the hormone which makes u so tired
07/11/2016, 17:33 - Mom: Need to wait for 2 days for recovery
07/11/2016, 17:34 - Mom: I told u that i was sick yesterday

07/11/2016, 17:40 - Cindy LEUNG: U know alcoholism is a really big problem here
07/11/2016, 17:40 - Cindy LEUNG: And it costs the NHS so much money
07/11/2016, 17:40 - Mom: I mean if u take too much panadol, it hurts ur liver
07/11/2016, 17:40 - Mom: And ur liver wud be toxicated
07/11/2016, 17:41 - Cindy LEUNG: But I don't drink so my liver is still good quality

07/11/2016, 17:42 - Cindy LEUNG: I'm literally doing nothing right now
07/11/2016, 17:42 - Mom: Btw, panadols wont help much in period
07/11/2016, 17:42 - Cindy LEUNG: I have headaches
07/11/2016, 17:42 - Mom: I know
07/11/2016, 17:43 - Cindy LEUNG: They were so bad I wondered if they were brain zaps
07/11/2016, 17:43 - Mom: Becoz of the hormone ma
07/11/2016, 17:43 - Cindy LEUNG: So I took some panadol
07/11/2016, 17:44 - Mom: Go to nhs tell them u had srs headache and ask for stronger painkiller
07/11/2016, 17:44 - Cindy LEUNG: I just fell asleep momentarily again
07/11/2016, 17:45 - Cindy LEUNG: Hormone makes me real tired
07/11/2016, 17:45 - Mom: Hormone is so horrible
07/11/2016, 17:46 - Mom: Always makes women unable to do work, or even think properly
07/11/2016, 17:53 - Cindy LEUNG: Great
07/11/2016, 17:54 - Cindy LEUNG: I bet I'm at risk of being hypo or hyperthyroid as well
07/11/2016, 17:54 - Mom: I bet hypo
07/11/2016, 17:55 - Mom: If hyper, u shud get thin
07/11/2016, 17:56 - Cindy LEUNG: Fml
07/11/2016, 17:57 - Cindy LEUNG: I need be friends with an endocrinologist
07/11/2016, 17:57 - Cindy LEUNG: How am I gonna get those blood tests
07/11/2016, 17:58 - Mom: Nhs?
07/11/2016, 17:58 - Mom: Or get it online?
08/11/2016, 11:17 - Cindy LEUNG: yo
08/11/2016, 11:17 - Cindy LEUNG: i tried to watch my macro lectures and its not been very successful this morning
08/11/2016, 11:17 - Mom: sup
08/11/2016, 11:19 - Cindy LEUNG: i keep falling asleep while watching kevin talk
08/11/2016, 11:19 - Cindy LEUNG: so i've given up
08/11/2016, 11:20 - Mom: üòûüòû
08/11/2016, 11:20 - Mom: still very tired?
08/11/2016, 11:20 - Cindy LEUNG: no
08/11/2016, 11:20 - Cindy LEUNG: that's the thing
08/11/2016, 11:20 - Cindy LEUNG: so i'm thinking now
08/11/2016, 11:20 - Mom: wat?
08/11/2016, 11:20 - Cindy LEUNG: obs 1 - i don't realise i fall asleep until i wake up
08/11/2016, 11:21 - Cindy LEUNG: obs 2 - i get hallucinations much more frequently
08/11/2016, 11:21 - Mom: conclusion?
08/11/2016, 11:22 - Cindy LEUNG: hallucinations concede with sleeping events
08/11/2016, 11:22 - Mom: what kind of hallucinations? hearing or sight?
08/11/2016, 11:22 - Cindy LEUNG: both lah
08/11/2016, 11:22 - Cindy LEUNG: 1 - how come i don't realise i fall asleep first?
08/11/2016, 11:23 - Cindy LEUNG: so i remember my sleep onset latency is really fast right
08/11/2016, 11:23 - Mom: yea
08/11/2016, 11:23 - Cindy LEUNG: could i possible that the moment i close my eyes i already start dreaming?
08/11/2016, 11:23 - Mom: wow
08/11/2016, 11:24 - Cindy LEUNG: so say i blink
08/11/2016, 11:24 - Cindy LEUNG: i don't realise i've fallen asleep
08/11/2016, 11:24 - Mom: so fast??
08/11/2016, 11:24 - Cindy LEUNG: and the dreams seem like continuation of reality to me
08/11/2016, 11:24 - Cindy LEUNG: either that
08/11/2016, 11:24 - Cindy LEUNG: or
08/11/2016, 11:24 - Mom: this is incredibly, even blink will makes u fall asleep?
08/11/2016, 11:25 - Cindy LEUNG: there must be some correlation between fast sleep onset and hypnagogic hallucinations
08/11/2016, 11:26 - Cindy LEUNG: i could possibly have started hallucinating - that's when the lecture starts becoming confusing -- and i don't realise it
08/11/2016, 11:27 - Mom: hmm
08/11/2016, 11:27 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz hypnagogic hallucinations are normal right
08/11/2016, 11:27 - Mom: how long the time past when u realised that u just fell asleep?
08/11/2016, 11:27 - Cindy LEUNG: maybe like 5 mins?
08/11/2016, 11:28 - Cindy LEUNG: i only know when i wake up
08/11/2016, 11:28 - Cindy LEUNG: which means i definitely when into rem/ dream state
08/11/2016, 11:28 - Mom: so, u fell asleep not knowingly and had hallucinations and then woke up rite?
08/11/2016, 11:29 - Cindy LEUNG: i think its possible that i could have been remming without being completely asleep, so in the beginning i was dreaming while awake and those seem like hallucinations to me
08/11/2016, 11:29 - Mom: the whole process lasted for abt 5 mins?
08/11/2016, 11:29 - Cindy LEUNG: yea
08/11/2016, 11:29 - Cindy LEUNG: because my SOL is very fast
08/11/2016, 11:29 - Cindy LEUNG: right
08/11/2016, 11:30 - Mom: so those things existed in ur hallucination looked like the reality?
08/11/2016, 11:31 - Cindy LEUNG: i'm suggesting that i couldn't tell that they were hallucinations
08/11/2016, 11:31 - Cindy LEUNG: hmmm
08/11/2016, 11:31 - Cindy LEUNG: how do i explain
08/11/2016, 11:31 - Cindy LEUNG: like, i'm trying to say that
08/11/2016, 11:31 - Cindy LEUNG: i'm listening to teh lecture
08/11/2016, 11:32 - Mom: i'm trying to find out if u were just in a state of in and out of wake and asleep state during that period of time when u said u were hallucinating
08/11/2016, 11:32 - Cindy LEUNG: and then my brain is falling asleep gradually, in brief moments going in and out of sleep state.
08/11/2016, 11:33 - Mom: this is what i meant
08/11/2016, 11:33 - Mom: did u find ur dreams/hallucinations in different scenario as ur reality?
08/11/2016, 11:33 - Mom: i meant u def rmb what's in ur hallucination after waking up?
08/11/2016, 11:34 - Mom: fell aslepp?
08/11/2016, 11:34 - Cindy LEUNG: okay wait
08/11/2016, 11:34 - Cindy LEUNG: forget about hallucination frist
08/11/2016, 11:34 - Cindy LEUNG: that word is confusing
08/11/2016, 11:35 - Cindy LEUNG: so there are brief moments when i dip into sleep stages right
08/11/2016, 11:36 - Cindy LEUNG: so i'm registering this lecture, my brain probably makes up the parts i didn't listen to (cuz i'm sleeping)
08/11/2016, 11:36 - Mom: those sleep wud be phase 1 or 2 of the sleep cycle
08/11/2016, 11:36 - Cindy LEUNG: no i think i go straight to rem
08/11/2016, 11:36 - Mom: u did dream?
08/11/2016, 11:37 - Cindy LEUNG: remember how i could hold a conversation while seeing all the stuff in my dream
08/11/2016, 11:37 - Mom: hmm
08/11/2016, 11:37 - Cindy LEUNG: so what's happening is that the brain fills in the gaps of reality as i'm going in to sleep
08/11/2016, 11:38 - Cindy LEUNG: with the dream
08/11/2016, 11:38 - Cindy LEUNG: so i don't even realise that i'm falling asleep
08/11/2016, 11:39 - Mom: ü§îü§îü§î
08/11/2016, 11:39 - Cindy LEUNG: and why i mentioned hallucinations is that i maybe dreaming, but i'm awake -- so i could possible confuse those with complex hallucinations
08/11/2016, 11:40 - Cindy LEUNG: why this keeps happening with presentations idk
08/11/2016, 11:40 - Cindy LEUNG: maybe my brain can't learn thinking through this method?
08/11/2016, 11:41 - Cindy LEUNG: its too passive?
08/11/2016, 11:41 - Mom: u mean when ur listening to presentation?
08/11/2016, 11:41 - Cindy LEUNG: yeah
08/11/2016, 11:41 - Cindy LEUNG: or its probably that the lecturer is way too boring cuz he's super monotonous
08/11/2016, 11:42 - Mom: this situation doesn't happen in every lecture?
08/11/2016, 11:42 - Cindy LEUNG: no
08/11/2016, 11:42 - Cindy LEUNG: but some more frequent than others
08/11/2016, 11:43 - Cindy LEUNG: i remember reading a paper where monotonous lulling sounds actually trigger a reflex which puts cats into rem state.
08/11/2016, 11:43 - Mom: is there a consistent pattern that it happens more in boring class?
08/11/2016, 11:43 - Cindy LEUNG: yes
08/11/2016, 11:43 - Mom: so u become cat?
08/11/2016, 11:43 - Cindy LEUNG: no they had to use cats as subjects
08/11/2016, 11:44 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz they modified their brains
08/11/2016, 11:44 - Cindy LEUNG: so that they could only rem
08/11/2016, 11:44 - Mom: reflex???
08/11/2016, 11:45 - Cindy LEUNG: yea can be triggered like a reflex
08/11/2016, 11:45 - Cindy LEUNG: rem
08/11/2016, 11:45 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz if u think about it, if u don't rem you will die
08/11/2016, 11:45 - Mom: u mean never had rem?
08/11/2016, 11:46 - Mom: but pp used to rem in their sleep cycle
08/11/2016, 11:46 - Mom: how's ur sleep last night?
08/11/2016, 11:46 - Cindy LEUNG: yes, i remember the longest the cats survived in the experiment was 11 days
08/11/2016, 11:47 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz they further modified their brains so they basically didn't even sleep afterwards
08/11/2016, 11:47 - Cindy LEUNG: ok lah
08/11/2016, 11:47 - Cindy LEUNG: disjointed
08/11/2016, 11:48 - Mom: i mean did u wake up at 4 am?
08/11/2016, 11:48 - Cindy LEUNG: i woke up at 2:30, 5:00, 8:00
08/11/2016, 11:48 - Cindy LEUNG: and 12:30 if that counts as well
08/11/2016, 11:50 - Mom: so ur sleep phases were broken up by brief wake up in between rite?
08/11/2016, 11:50 - Cindy LEUNG: i think they're more like individual cycles
08/11/2016, 11:51 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz i woke up naturally at those times
08/11/2016, 11:51 - Mom: sigh....
08/11/2016, 11:51 - Cindy LEUNG: i basically rem too much
08/11/2016, 11:52 - Mom: during daytime or night time?
08/11/2016, 11:52 - Cindy LEUNG: ofc daytime
08/11/2016, 11:53 - Cindy LEUNG: basically if i'm quite and i don't move very much, my brain takes that as a sign to go into sleep mode
08/11/2016, 11:54 - Mom: ...
08/11/2016, 11:54 - Cindy LEUNG: i'm not tired most of the time
08/11/2016, 11:55 - Mom: after rem, did u feel refreshed or even more tired?
08/11/2016, 11:55 - Cindy LEUNG: nothing i was not tired before i went to sleep
08/11/2016, 11:55 - Cindy LEUNG: my point is that i do not go into rem sleep because my body thinks it is tired
08/11/2016, 11:56 - Cindy LEUNG: it goes into rem sleep because there was some other stimulus
08/11/2016, 11:57 - Mom: no, i mean do those involuntarily rem sleep made u tired after sleep?
08/11/2016, 11:57 - Cindy LEUNG: no
08/11/2016, 11:57 - Cindy LEUNG: they make me confused
08/11/2016, 11:58 - Mom: becos u can't distinguish between reality and dream?
08/11/2016, 11:58 - Cindy LEUNG: no its more like, i don't immediately remember teh stuff that hapened before i fell asleep
08/11/2016, 11:58 - Cindy LEUNG: so i need to think for a while
08/11/2016, 11:58 - Cindy LEUNG: and then it comes to me and then its ok
08/11/2016, 11:59 - Mom: but u can recall ur memories after a while?
08/11/2016, 11:59 - Cindy LEUNG: yes i don't have amnesia
08/11/2016, 11:59 - Cindy LEUNG: but i notice there's always like a gap of time
08/11/2016, 12:00 - Cindy LEUNG: where my motor functions still work (so i still write)
08/11/2016, 12:00 - Cindy LEUNG: and then my brain starts getting confused (so i write random crap which doesn't make sense)
08/11/2016, 12:00 - Cindy LEUNG: this is from looking at my lecture notes
08/11/2016, 12:00 - Cindy LEUNG: so i don't remember whether those events were actually happening or not
08/11/2016, 12:01 - Cindy LEUNG: u know when i send u write crap i wrote like "measure the PV of violence."
08/11/2016, 12:01 - Cindy LEUNG: that's what i'm talking about
08/11/2016, 12:02 - Mom: that's what u previously identify as micro sleep rite?
08/11/2016, 12:02 - Cindy LEUNG: erm yea i think so
08/11/2016, 12:02 - Cindy LEUNG: or like the times when i'm trying to work on a math problem
08/11/2016, 12:03 - Cindy LEUNG: and then a really supposedly easy questions suddenly becomes really difficult and i don't know why
08/11/2016, 12:03 - Cindy LEUNG: and then after awhile i can't control my pen
08/11/2016, 12:04 - Cindy LEUNG: and there's ink blots everywhere
08/11/2016, 12:04 - Cindy LEUNG: and then i give up out of frustration
08/11/2016, 12:04 - Cindy LEUNG: i think i called those microsleep before
08/11/2016, 12:04 - Mom: üò©üò©üò©üò©
08/11/2016, 12:04 - Mom: this thing happens always?
08/11/2016, 12:05 - Cindy LEUNG: this has been happening since hl maths
08/11/2016, 12:05 - Cindy LEUNG: this is why i was diagnosed with narco
08/11/2016, 12:07 - Cindy LEUNG: i suspect if i didn't go into rem that quickly, i could fix teh situation
08/11/2016, 12:07 - Mom: since the start of yr13, rite?
08/11/2016, 12:07 - Cindy LEUNG: yeah
08/11/2016, 12:07 - Cindy LEUNG: now i see green
08/11/2016, 12:08 - Cindy LEUNG: which i think is the same thing
08/11/2016, 12:08 - Mom: ur rite, the problem seems relating to rem sleep
08/11/2016, 12:09 - Mom: sorry, what do u think seeing green thing is the same as?
08/11/2016, 12:09 - Mom: rem?
08/11/2016, 12:09 - Cindy LEUNG: it could just be a simple hypnagogic hallucination
08/11/2016, 12:10 - Cindy LEUNG: i think its because i fall into rem so quickly that so many weird events which are supposed to be confined to sleep state become like hallucinations
08/11/2016, 12:10 - Mom: u didn't hallucinate before going into rem now? just saw green thing?
08/11/2016, 12:11 - Cindy LEUNG: no i only see green when im tired
08/11/2016, 12:11 - Cindy LEUNG: actually tired
08/11/2016, 12:11 - Cindy LEUNG: or before going into seizure
08/11/2016, 12:11 - Cindy LEUNG: so i suspected that it was sign of lack of rem sleep as well
08/11/2016, 12:12 - Cindy LEUNG: i really don't think i have migraine either, because i have no family history of that
08/11/2016, 12:13 - Cindy LEUNG: the med student said my eye movements when i fall are characteristic of seizures
08/11/2016, 12:13 - Mom: if there were 4 - 5 sleep cycles during a normal sleep, u prob had more than 5 rems already cuz u rem during daytime as well
08/11/2016, 12:14 - Cindy LEUNG: i think i sleep enough, i definitely sleep enough or else i'll go into seizure
08/11/2016, 12:14 - Cindy LEUNG: i use to go into seizure quite a lot around breakfast  time
08/11/2016, 12:14 - Mom: u had seizure when u fall? cataplexy?
08/11/2016, 12:15 - Cindy LEUNG: yea like i said last time, what we call cataplexy may be a mini seizure
08/11/2016, 12:16 - Mom: so ur conclusion is ur cataplexy is also rem sleep, rite?
08/11/2016, 12:17 - Cindy LEUNG: what we call cataplexy is me having a mini seizure
08/11/2016, 12:17 - Cindy LEUNG: idk what the link with rem sleep is
08/11/2016, 12:17 - Cindy LEUNG: all i know is seizures can be triggered by certain stimulus
08/11/2016, 12:18 - Mom: so, ur guess is that there might be abnormal blood vessels in ur brain, that trigger ur sleep problem
08/11/2016, 12:18 - Cindy LEUNG: no i never said that
08/11/2016, 12:19 - Cindy LEUNG: i never said anything about blood vessels
08/11/2016, 12:19 - Cindy LEUNG: that's your guess
08/11/2016, 12:19 - Cindy LEUNG: not mine
08/11/2016, 12:20 - Cindy LEUNG: fuck now how am i gonna get through this lecture
08/11/2016, 12:21 - Mom: seizure must be triggered by anything rite? it can just exist without any prior events throughout ur past 17 years
08/11/2016, 12:21 - Cindy LEUNG: yea i suppose
08/11/2016, 12:21 - Mom: what lecture is it?
08/11/2016, 12:21 - Cindy LEUNG: macro
08/11/2016, 12:22 - Cindy LEUNG: i think i should apply for an iea
08/11/2016, 12:22 - Mom: what iea?
08/11/2016, 12:22 - Cindy LEUNG: examination adjustment
08/11/2016, 12:22 - Mom: k
08/11/2016, 12:22 - Mom: but u need to tell them what happened to u
08/11/2016, 12:22 - Cindy LEUNG: but what can they do anyways
08/11/2016, 12:23 - Cindy LEUNG: i'm thinking of just saying that i keep seeing stuff turn green
08/11/2016, 12:23 - Mom: i think u need a companion or study group to help u through the lectures

08/11/2016, 12:28 - Mom: is it only macro having prob?

08/11/2016, 12:28 - Mom: all subjects?
08/11/2016, 12:29 - Cindy LEUNG: it depends on the lecturer
08/11/2016, 12:29 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz its the sounds which triggers rem
08/11/2016, 12:29 - Mom: cuz i rmb that last yr, u didn't have prob with macro

08/11/2016, 12:30 - Mom: yea
08/11/2016, 12:30 - Cindy LEUNG: what i was trying to get at was that if u think of rem as a seizure state

08/11/2016, 12:30 - Mom: so ur prob is if u don't go to lectures, u can't learn things and can't do prob set?

09/11/2016, 15:12 - Cindy LEUNG: That's why I assume muscle ache
09/11/2016, 15:12 - Mom: will it be ur lungs problem?
09/11/2016, 15:13 - Cindy LEUNG: Not sure
09/11/2016, 15:13 - Mom: why don't go to nhs?

09/11/2016, 15:15 - Mom: u must do something to help ur body
09/11/2016, 15:16 - Cindy LEUNG: But I won't take the medication anyways... Cuz I don't want to gain more weigh from antidepressants
09/11/2016, 15:17 - Mom: antidepressants won't help seizures, it's anti-seizure med
09/11/2016, 15:17 - Cindy LEUNG: But that's for epilepsy
09/11/2016, 15:17 - Mom: but i don't know if it'll make u gain weigh or not

09/11/2016, 15:18 - Mom: so, better not to try anything u don't know
09/11/2016, 15:19 - Cindy LEUNG: But that's alcohol and that messes my heart
09/11/2016, 15:19 - Mom: ur condition now is worse than that last yr, i'm so worry that if u can make it to the end of this second yr
09/11/2016, 15:19 - Cindy LEUNG: Hmm I wouldn't say it's worse
09/11/2016, 15:19 - Mom: ur heart won't be messed up in a day
09/11/2016, 15:19 - Cindy LEUNG: Its abt the same.
09/11/2016, 15:20 - Mom: ur heart is normally strong rite
09/11/2016, 15:20 - Cindy LEUNG: But the workload is more demanding
09/11/2016, 15:20 - Mom: sure la
09/11/2016, 15:20 - Cindy LEUNG: And i hv worse sleep
09/11/2016, 15:20 - Mom: becoz it's the critical yr
09/11/2016, 15:20 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz I sleep with the lights on
09/11/2016, 15:20 - Mom: but u told me ur nightmares gone?
09/11/2016, 15:20 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea but I still get anxiety
09/11/2016, 15:21 - Mom: so still sleep with lights on?
09/11/2016, 15:21 - Cindy LEUNG: I went through like 3 months of sleep paralysis and almost 9 months of nightmare and hallucinations
09/11/2016, 15:21 - Mom: then u probably can't have good sleep quality
09/11/2016, 15:21 - Cindy LEUNG: There's some conditioning going on
09/11/2016, 15:22 - Mom: do u know exactly what ur anxiety is?
09/11/2016, 15:22 - Cindy LEUNG: That's why I cant even talk abt normal stuff with people anymore
09/11/2016, 15:22 - Mom: i mean what things made u anxious
09/11/2016, 15:22 - Cindy LEUNG: Saaah
09/11/2016, 15:22 - Cindy LEUNG: The dark?
09/11/2016, 15:22 - Mom: so u don't have friends anymore?
09/11/2016, 15:22 - Cindy LEUNG: No not really
09/11/2016, 15:23 - Cindy LEUNG: The opportunity cost of having friends is that u have to fall all the time.
09/11/2016, 15:23 - Cindy LEUNG: And get mood swings
09/11/2016, 15:23 - Cindy LEUNG: Trade off
09/11/2016, 15:23 - Mom: why modd swings?
09/11/2016, 15:24 - Cindy LEUNG: Dunno cuz when I fall more I guess my emotions are less of a flat line
09/11/2016, 15:24 - Mom: ok
09/11/2016, 15:24 - Cindy LEUNG: I think my mood was definitely more volatile last year
09/11/2016, 15:24 - Mom: u feel ashamed when u fall rite?
09/11/2016, 15:24 - Cindy LEUNG: Now I'm like
09/11/2016, 15:25 - Cindy LEUNG: Deliberately keeping it like a flat linr
09/11/2016, 15:25 - Cindy LEUNG: So sometimes i feel a bit down
09/11/2016, 15:25 - Cindy LEUNG: Most of the time I'm ok
09/11/2016, 15:25 - Cindy LEUNG: I can still get pretty angry
09/11/2016, 15:25 - Cindy LEUNG: Thts abt it
09/11/2016, 15:26 - Mom: ok
09/11/2016, 15:26 - Mom: no. 1 u have to tell urself that ur anxiety is nothing
09/11/2016, 15:26 - Cindy LEUNG: And then studying helps keeping my mood in a flat line.
09/11/2016, 15:26 - Mom: talk to urself frankly and face ur mood naturally
09/11/2016, 15:27 - Cindy LEUNG: I just can't sleep
09/11/2016, 15:27 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz there's a part of me which is scared of sleeping
09/11/2016, 15:27 - Mom: otherwsie u can only live in anxious world
09/11/2016, 15:27 - Mom: why can't sleep?
09/11/2016, 15:27 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz the lights r on
09/11/2016, 15:27 - Mom: scared of nightmares?
09/11/2016, 15:28 - Mom: can u dim the lights to make the room not so bright so that u can sleep?
09/11/2016, 15:28 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea like I said, I had continuous nightmare for like 4 months
09/11/2016, 15:29 - Mom: those r just bad dreams, they won't hurt u in any way
09/11/2016, 15:29 - Mom: forget them when u woke up from sleep
09/11/2016, 15:30 - Mom: just treat them as normal dreams
09/11/2016, 15:30 - Mom: if u rlly care and mind those dreams, then they won't go away
09/11/2016, 15:30 - Mom: or u can try shout the dreams to go away
09/11/2016, 15:31 - Mom: i think it's ur emotions which can't be directed away that makes u so frustrated and down sometimes

09/11/2016, 15:39 - Mom: don't bother whether they go or not, just treat them normally as if a passby
09/11/2016, 15:39 - Mom: passer-by
09/11/2016, 15:40 - Cindy LEUNG: U know conditioning?
09/11/2016, 15:40 - Mom: how come u'been conditioned by those dreams
09/11/2016, 15:40 - Mom: impossible
09/11/2016, 15:41 - Mom: let them go and tell ur body to rest properly, i mean sleep
09/11/2016, 15:41 - Cindy LEUNG: Because I had them every single night
09/11/2016, 15:42 - Cindy LEUNG: I was in fear every single night
09/11/2016, 15:42 - Mom: think of the days when u didn't have them
09/11/2016, 15:43 - Mom: everything is trying to go back to its homeostatic status
09/11/2016, 15:43 - Mom: u need not to scare anymore

09/11/2016, 15:45 - Mom: now go out for a 10 mins walk and get back to ur work or other stuff?
09/11/2016, 15:46 - Mom: if u concentrate on ur fear or anxiety, then u'll feel even more scare and anxious
09/11/2016, 15:46 - Mom: do different things to divert ur thoughts, this is to balance ur mood

10/11/2016, 12:22 - Mom: Always a difficult choice
10/11/2016, 12:22 - Cindy LEUNG: I searched up alcohol associations with seizure and epilepsy
10/11/2016, 12:23 - Cindy LEUNG: It seems that theres quite a lot of studies ob this
10/11/2016, 12:23 - Cindy LEUNG: Seems like low doses of ethanol has anticonvulsant effect
10/11/2016, 12:24 - Cindy LEUNG: Could that explain why I get less cataplexy with alcohol
10/11/2016, 12:25 - Mom: u wanna drink alcohol everyday?
10/11/2016, 12:26 - Cindy LEUNG: Maybe there's a way of using very small doses frequently
10/11/2016, 12:26 - Cindy LEUNG: Like I just hv to work out optimum amount
10/11/2016, 12:26 - Cindy LEUNG: Take it three times daily
10/11/2016, 12:27 - Mom: u can try small amount for a short period of time to see the result first
10/11/2016, 12:27 - Mom: three times daily too much
10/11/2016, 12:27 - Cindy LEUNG: I actually never thought of experimenting like this.
10/11/2016, 12:27 - Mom: once daily
10/11/2016, 12:27 - Cindy LEUNG: I metabolise ethanol really quickly
10/11/2016, 12:27 - Mom: one time daily with minimum amount
10/11/2016, 12:28 - Cindy LEUNG: There's a study where they used ethanol as a solvent with benzos to treat focal seizures in a rat
10/11/2016, 12:28 - Mom: bear in mind that ur opportunity cost is damage to the liver
10/11/2016, 12:28 - Mom: sigh
10/11/2016, 12:28 - Cindy LEUNG: Well any medication is going to be treated by the liver
10/11/2016, 12:28 - Cindy LEUNG: I mean I drank so much TCM
10/11/2016, 12:29 - Mom: u didn't even have proper examination of ur condition, how can u conclude u had seizure
10/11/2016, 12:29 - Cindy LEUNG: That has effect on liver as well

10/11/2016, 12:30 - Mom: u shud go out with friends to divert ur emotions
10/11/2016, 12:31 - Cindy LEUNG: Trade off
10/11/2016, 12:31 - Cindy LEUNG: Then I fall more
10/11/2016, 12:31 - Cindy LEUNG: And then risk hitting my head
10/11/2016, 12:31 - Mom: ur friends know ur condition, they'll care abt u
10/11/2016, 12:31 - Mom: if u didn't go out, u didn't fall?

11/11/2016, 00:11 - Cindy LEUNG: No, no obvious trigger
11/11/2016, 00:11 - Mom: sigh
11/11/2016, 00:12 - Cindy LEUNG: But I could feel like it wanted to go up like 2 mins prior to the episode
11/11/2016, 00:12 - Mom: do u feel pain at ur chest when ur hr is raised to that high level?
11/11/2016, 00:12 - Cindy LEUNG: Chest pain and hyperventilation only starts to set in after first min
11/11/2016, 00:13 - Mom: what do u mean by "it wanted to go up like ..."?
11/11/2016, 00:13 - Cindy LEUNG: Not sure how to describe, like I know it's coming
11/11/2016, 00:13 - Cindy LEUNG: My chest felt really uncomfortable
11/11/2016, 00:13 - Mom: before the episode?
11/11/2016, 00:14 - Cindy LEUNG: Yah
11/11/2016, 00:14 - Mom: i see
11/11/2016, 00:14 - Mom: any headache at the same time?
11/11/2016, 00:15 - Cindy LEUNG: no
11/11/2016, 00:15 - Cindy LEUNG: but if i shake my head when my hr was 200+ yea
11/11/2016, 00:15 - Cindy LEUNG: but that's a given
11/11/2016, 00:15 - Mom: do go to nhs tmr
11/11/2016, 00:16 - Cindy LEUNG: yea
11/11/2016, 00:16 - Mom: what did u eat for dinner?
11/11/2016, 00:16 - Cindy LEUNG: i think i might have partial seizures
11/11/2016, 00:17 - Mom: go ask for a checkup
11/11/2016, 00:17 - Cindy LEUNG: stir fried veggies
11/11/2016, 00:17 - Cindy LEUNG: sush
11/11/2016, 00:17 - Cindy LEUNG: sushi
11/11/2016, 00:17 - Cindy LEUNG: i seriously think i might have partial seizures
11/11/2016, 00:17 - Cindy LEUNG: so i'm just gonna tell them everything
11/11/2016, 00:17 - Mom: everything what?
11/11/2016, 00:18 - Mom: ur sleep prob? cataplexy?
11/11/2016, 00:18 - Cindy LEUNG: my seizures
11/11/2016, 00:18 - Mom: ok
11/11/2016, 00:19 - Cindy LEUNG: they use flowcharts, u can't start with so many things
11/11/2016, 00:19 - Mom: k
11/11/2016, 00:19 - Cindy LEUNG: other than that, focal seizures have no treatment as well so that's great
11/11/2016, 00:20 - Mom: it's this flowchart thingy that makes impossible to treat with complex problems
11/11/2016, 00:20 - Mom: why no treatment?
11/11/2016, 00:20 - Mom: might have anti-seizure drug
11/11/2016, 00:20 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz there hasn't been one developed so far?
11/11/2016, 00:20 - Mom: omg
11/11/2016, 00:20 - Cindy LEUNG: focal seizures are the most difficult to treat
11/11/2016, 00:21 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz its only a localized part of the brain
11/11/2016, 00:21 - Cindy LEUNG: i suspect i get parietal lobe seizures, cuz i can't do math and it confuses me
11/11/2016, 00:21 - Mom: still only maths prob now?
11/11/2016, 00:22 - Cindy LEUNG: not sure what you mean to ask, but inability to do simple math problems is a very obvious symptom
11/11/2016, 00:23 - Mom: i mean symptom existed only in dealing with maths not other subject rite
11/11/2016, 00:23 - Cindy LEUNG: its not the subject
11/11/2016, 00:24 - Cindy LEUNG: its like a certain type of task which is simple math problems
11/11/2016, 00:24 - Cindy LEUNG: so what matter isn't the subject
11/11/2016, 00:26 - Mom: is the symptom same, i mean no better or worse, since the start or yr 13?
11/11/2016, 00:26 - Cindy LEUNG: no better no worse
11/11/2016, 00:26 - Cindy LEUNG: exactly the same
11/11/2016, 00:26 - Mom: ok
11/11/2016, 00:26 - Cindy LEUNG: same stuff, same occurances
11/11/2016, 00:27 - Mom: just want to make sure we didn't do anything making thing worse
11/11/2016, 00:27 - Cindy LEUNG: no i haven't done anything anyways
11/11/2016, 00:28 - Mom: ok, take a rest
11/11/2016, 00:29 - Cindy LEUNG: so i think the other problem is at i'm seriously at risk of going into  depression
11/11/2016, 00:29 - Mom: sigh
11/11/2016, 00:29 - Mom: that's why i told u to hang out with friends sometimes
11/11/2016, 00:30 - Cindy LEUNG: sigh is not good response
11/11/2016, 00:30 - Cindy LEUNG: u know how i hanged out with my flatmates last year
11/11/2016, 00:30 - Cindy LEUNG: i talked to them sitting on the floor
11/11/2016, 00:31 - Mom: u mean u laughed a lot when u hang out with friends rite?
11/11/2016, 00:32 - Cindy LEUNG: yeah ofc that's the point of hanging out with friends
11/11/2016, 00:33 - Cindy LEUNG: plus there's carry on effect
11/11/2016, 00:33 - Cindy LEUNG: if i had a good time with them
11/11/2016, 00:33 - Cindy LEUNG: then the moment i see them next time, i will fall
11/11/2016, 00:33 - Mom: haaa
11/11/2016, 00:34 - Cindy LEUNG: its not a simple matter of just laugh less
11/11/2016, 00:34 - Mom: how that happens? expectation?
11/11/2016, 00:34 - Mom: omg
11/11/2016, 00:34 - Cindy LEUNG: i don't know
11/11/2016, 00:34 - Cindy LEUNG: the only way to decrease risk of falling is just to have no friends
11/11/2016, 00:34 - Cindy LEUNG: and don't see anybody
11/11/2016, 00:34 - Cindy LEUNG: which is basically what i'm doing.
11/11/2016, 00:35 - Cindy LEUNG: which then, the trade off is, i get more sensitive
11/11/2016, 00:35 - Mom: this expectation thingy also applies to ur hs friends?
11/11/2016, 00:35 - Cindy LEUNG: yea
11/11/2016, 00:35 - Cindy LEUNG: why not
11/11/2016, 00:35 - Mom: OMG
11/11/2016, 00:36 - Cindy LEUNG: the trade off is, I get more sensitive, making it not only more likely to trigger weakness but also seizures
11/11/2016, 00:37 - Cindy LEUNG: so i don't even know what the fuck to do right now
11/11/2016, 00:37 - Mom: no panic
11/11/2016, 00:38 - Mom: relax and go check for ur seizure problem first
11/11/2016, 00:38 - Cindy LEUNG: because it is a delicate balance of trying to limit my contact with people, and getting enough human contact to not fall into depression
11/11/2016, 00:39 - Mom: i get how u feel now
11/11/2016, 00:39 - Cindy LEUNG: not to mention i also have a fucking degree to finish
11/11/2016, 00:40 - Cindy LEUNG: and i have to always find way to work around my productivity problems.
11/11/2016, 00:42 - Mom: will crying be better to divert ur emotion?
11/11/2016, 00:42 - Cindy LEUNG: no
11/11/2016, 00:43 - Cindy LEUNG: i'm not sad
11/11/2016, 00:43 - Cindy LEUNG: i'm depressed
11/11/2016, 00:43 - Cindy LEUNG: 30% of people with epilepsy go into depression
11/11/2016, 00:43 - Mom: no ah, can't let urself go into depression
11/11/2016, 00:43 - Cindy LEUNG: because their symptoms are hard to deal with
11/11/2016, 00:43 - Cindy LEUNG: i read that i am thinking
11/11/2016, 00:43 - Cindy LEUNG: oh boy
11/11/2016, 00:45 - Cindy LEUNG: not to mention that thing messes with my brain a lot
11/11/2016, 00:45 - Cindy LEUNG: not only am i confused before and after the eizures
11/11/2016, 00:46 - Cindy LEUNG: i've forgotten a lot of names from laast year
11/11/2016, 00:47 - Mom: ok, relax
11/11/2016, 00:47 - Mom: go for a checkup with nhs first
11/11/2016, 00:47 - Mom: don't put too much pressure on urself
11/11/2016, 00:48 - Cindy LEUNG: stop telling me to rela
11/11/2016, 00:49 - Cindy LEUNG: rela
11/11/2016, 00:49 - Cindy LEUNG: realx
11/11/2016, 00:49 - Cindy LEUNG: that has opposite effect
11/11/2016, 00:49 - Mom: ok
11/11/2016, 00:50 - Mom: go ahead speak out all ur grievance and worries
11/11/2016, 00:50 - Mom: will it be better to balance ur emotion
11/11/2016, 00:51 - Mom: u said u forgot names from last year, what r they?
11/11/2016, 00:51 - Mom: friends or from academic learning?

11/11/2016, 00:55 - Cindy LEUNG: i just forget them
11/11/2016, 00:55 - Mom: so those r new names not old names
11/11/2016, 00:56 - Cindy LEUNG: i mean ofc i still remember the names of my hs friends
11/11/2016, 00:56 - Cindy LEUNG: but new people, not a chance on first meeting
11/11/2016, 00:57 - Cindy LEUNG: the rest of my memory still seems the same
11/11/2016, 00:57 - Cindy LEUNG: its just this thing with names
11/11/2016, 00:57 - Cindy LEUNG: which makes it more convincing that they're focal seizures
11/11/2016, 00:57 - Mom: did u remember ur flatmates from last year?
11/11/2016, 00:57 - Cindy LEUNG: well yeah ofc
11/11/2016, 00:57 - Cindy LEUNG: i saw them everyday
11/11/2016, 00:57 - Cindy LEUNG: wtf
11/11/2016, 00:58 - Mom: that means u can't remember names easily for those new and not met very often
11/11/2016, 00:59 - Cindy LEUNG: yea
11/11/2016, 00:59 - Cindy LEUNG: in summary
11/11/2016, 00:59 - Cindy LEUNG: i'm confused and worried every single day basically.
11/11/2016, 01:00 - Cindy LEUNG: plus my mood swings

11/11/2016, 01:07 - Cindy LEUNG: Its pretty much expected

11/11/2016, 01:07 - Mom: it's not ur fault, why feel hard?
11/11/2016, 01:07 - Cindy LEUNG: And I'm just the personification of emotional baggage
11/11/2016, 01:09 - Cindy LEUNG: because i can't control what other people think
11/11/2016, 01:10 - Mom: u don't have to control how other ppl think, it's ur thought that bother ur emotion
11/11/2016, 01:10 - Mom: u need not feel embarrassed or ashamed
11/11/2016, 01:10 - Mom: this is normal for every person in difficulties
11/11/2016, 01:11 - Mom: if one of ur friend is like this, wud u see him/her like emotional burden?

11/11/2016, 01:18 - Mom: 2.  treat all other things normally
11/11/2016, 01:19 - Mom: u still have ur life, just a bit difficult now
11/11/2016, 01:19 - Mom: if not, wud u want to complain and feel depressed for the rest of ur time?
11/11/2016, 01:21 - Mom: all u need to do is try solve those problems by modules, u can't control everything in advance
11/11/2016, 01:21 - Mom: this is human being

11/11/2016, 01:28 - Mom: don't think that u're tired of being a human being
11/11/2016, 01:28 - Mom: it's life

11/11/2016, 13:15 - Cindy LEUNG: That's why they get hypothermia
11/11/2016, 13:15 - Mom: i was thinking if alcohol makes u sweat more
11/11/2016, 13:15 - Cindy LEUNG: No it happens everyday
11/11/2016, 13:15 - Cindy LEUNG: I know this cuz I walk to school everyday
11/11/2016, 13:16 - Mom: becos alcohol helps ur blood vessels dilate, so makes heat loss easily

11/11/2016, 15:27 - Mom: if the dr see every patient for 15 mins, then it wud be good for the patient becoz dr understand more of the patient's illness and arrive at more accurate diagnosis, rite
11/11/2016, 15:48 - Cindy LEUNG: Ok so I might get my brain scanned again

11/11/2016, 17:03 - Mom: i wud say it's like min-stroke

12/11/2016, 03:25 - Mom: or u just stay awake until daytime?
12/11/2016, 03:26 - Cindy LEUNG: Highly likely to go back to sleep latwr

12/11/2016, 03:26 - Mom: u can't control rite?
12/11/2016, 03:26 - Cindy LEUNG: Nope
12/11/2016, 03:27 - Mom: what if u keep staying on bed, keep ur eyes closed, didn't get up,  will it be easier to fall asleep shortly?
12/11/2016, 03:28 - Cindy LEUNG: No then I'll get super hot and irritated
12/11/2016, 03:28 - Mom: ic
12/11/2016, 03:30 - Cindy LEUNG: Also I recall something
12/11/2016, 03:30 - Cindy LEUNG: I seem to be more prone to seizure in Japanese class
12/11/2016, 03:31 - Mom: did u fall?
12/11/2016, 03:31 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz I had four classes so far and had a seizure in two of them
12/11/2016, 03:31 - Cindy LEUNG: No u sit in a chair for two hours
12/11/2016, 03:31 - Mom: what time is the jap class?
12/11/2016, 03:31 - Cindy LEUNG: 6-8
12/11/2016, 03:31 - Mom: did u sleep through the class?
12/11/2016, 03:31 - Cindy LEUNG: I think it's the time as well
12/11/2016, 03:31 - Cindy LEUNG: No
12/11/2016, 03:31 - Cindy LEUNG: I get a seizure
12/11/2016, 03:32 - Cindy LEUNG: I start shaking
12/11/2016, 03:32 - Mom: how's it like?
12/11/2016, 03:32 - Cindy LEUNG: Like right side of body start shaking
12/11/2016, 03:32 - Mom: anybody saw u shaking?
12/11/2016, 03:32 - Cindy LEUNG: Or maybe it's just the jaw
12/11/2016, 03:32 - Cindy LEUNG: Dunno
12/11/2016, 03:33 - Cindy LEUNG: And then I started to decrease awareness
12/11/2016, 03:33 - Cindy LEUNG: But still conscious, we were watching a video
12/11/2016, 03:33 - Cindy LEUNG: So I was still following thay
12/11/2016, 03:33 - Mom: did both the seizures happen when u were watching the video?
12/11/2016, 03:33 - Cindy LEUNG: And then my eyes start dropping
12/11/2016, 03:34 - Cindy LEUNG: No
12/11/2016, 03:34 - Cindy LEUNG: The other one was just sitting there
12/11/2016, 03:34 - Mom: how long it lasted?
12/11/2016, 03:34 - Cindy LEUNG: Like 10-15m?
12/11/2016, 03:34 - Cindy LEUNG: My eyes start dropping
12/11/2016, 03:34 - Mom: wow, this is rather long time
12/11/2016, 03:34 - Cindy LEUNG: I try to open them
12/11/2016, 03:35 - Cindy LEUNG: And then the teacher told I was tired
12/11/2016, 03:35 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz she told I was starting to nod off
12/11/2016, 03:35 - Cindy LEUNG: She thought
12/11/2016, 03:35 - Cindy LEUNG: And then she say something to me and shook me a bit
12/11/2016, 03:36 - Cindy LEUNG: And then also immediately, I woke up
12/11/2016, 03:36 - Cindy LEUNG: Like a 'click' feeling
12/11/2016, 03:36 - Mom: without any confusion?
12/11/2016, 03:37 - Cindy LEUNG: Erm I noticed her voice was a lot louder and clearer after I woke up
12/11/2016, 03:37 - Cindy LEUNG: And I didn't answer any questions while I was 'sleeping'
12/11/2016, 03:37 - Cindy LEUNG: Also I occasionally dipped my head
12/11/2016, 03:37 - Cindy LEUNG: When I couldn't support it
12/11/2016, 03:37 - Cindy LEUNG: So it looks like I was nodding iffy
12/11/2016, 03:37 - Cindy LEUNG: Off
12/11/2016, 03:38 - Mom: how long from the start of the class when both seizures happened?
12/11/2016, 03:39 - Cindy LEUNG: 1hr 30m
12/11/2016, 03:39 - Mom: almost the end of the class rite?
12/11/2016, 03:39 - Cindy LEUNG: 30 m to go
12/11/2016, 03:40 - Cindy LEUNG: I would say like halfway
12/11/2016, 03:40 - Mom: so, wud this imply ur brain got rlly tired having worked for like almost 2 hrs
12/11/2016, 03:40 - Cindy LEUNG: No because the lesson is not hard
12/11/2016, 03:42 - Cindy LEUNG: Maybe
12/11/2016, 03:42 - Cindy LEUNG: I also laughed and slumped down in my chair like a couple of times before getting a fully blown seizure in class 4
12/11/2016, 03:44 - Mom: looks like something, might be chemicals or whatever, accumulated inside ur brain when daily activities took place and ur brain then need time to clear up those wastes in the form of seizure or sleep?
12/11/2016, 03:45 - Cindy LEUNG: Yeah
12/11/2016, 03:46 - Mom: the prob is we can't figure out what that chemical is !!
12/11/2016, 03:46 - Cindy LEUNG: i assume that was rem sleep
12/11/2016, 03:46 - Cindy LEUNG: previously
12/11/2016, 03:46 - Cindy LEUNG: because i thought if i didn't get enough rem naps during teh day
12/11/2016, 03:46 - Cindy LEUNG: i would get a seizure in the evening
12/11/2016, 03:46 - Mom: but u already had enough rem sleep these couple years
12/11/2016, 03:47 - Cindy LEUNG: or if i didn't sleep well enough at night, then it would be likely that i get a rem seizure the next day
12/11/2016, 03:47 - Cindy LEUNG: but now
12/11/2016, 03:47 - Mom: but now ur seizure appeared randomly
12/11/2016, 03:47 - Cindy LEUNG: yah, not exactly random
12/11/2016, 03:47 - Cindy LEUNG: yea but the one on thursday was kind of random
12/11/2016, 03:47 - Cindy LEUNG: i think it was triggered by the series of muscle atonia eps i had before.
12/11/2016, 03:48 - Cindy LEUNG: question is why consecutive muscle atonia eps will trigger that sort of seizure
12/11/2016, 03:48 - Cindy LEUNG: and is it actually a rem seizure?
12/11/2016, 03:48 - Mom: can u find any pattern for those seizures, like time, surroundings when they appeared
12/11/2016, 03:48 - Cindy LEUNG: i used with go into rem sleep and have vivid dream with them
12/11/2016, 03:48 - Cindy LEUNG: but now
12/11/2016, 03:48 - Cindy LEUNG: its like i just need to wait until whatever is happen in the brain is done
12/11/2016, 03:49 - Cindy LEUNG: and then i get to return to normal function
12/11/2016, 03:49 - Mom: sorry, which step was skipped?
12/11/2016, 03:50 - Cindy LEUNG: going into rem sleep at the end
12/11/2016, 03:50 - Cindy LEUNG: i actually fall asleep at the end
12/11/2016, 03:50 - Cindy LEUNG: now i don't
12/11/2016, 03:50 - Mom: k
12/11/2016, 03:51 - Cindy LEUNG: so i never thought they were actually seizures
12/11/2016, 03:51 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz i was always falling asleep
12/11/2016, 03:51 - Cindy LEUNG: and people tell me i look like im falling asleep
12/11/2016, 03:51 - Mom: but now u didn't fall asleep, so u think they're seizures rite?
12/11/2016, 03:52 - Cindy LEUNG: yea and it feels like one, so that's why i've always used that term to describe them
12/11/2016, 03:52 - Cindy LEUNG: like a lot of stuff is happening in my head at once
12/11/2016, 03:52 - Mom: yea, ppl can only tell from ur head position and conclude that u fell asleep
12/11/2016, 03:52 - Cindy LEUNG: yea because it looks liek i fall asleep right
12/11/2016, 03:52 - Cindy LEUNG: esp my head keeps falling
12/11/2016, 03:52 - Mom: yea
12/11/2016, 03:53 - Mom: and ur eyes closed, u didn't move
12/11/2016, 03:53 - Cindy LEUNG: how do you tell that i'm going into one of these by looking at me eyes?
12/11/2016, 03:54 - Mom: tell what?
12/11/2016, 03:54 - Cindy LEUNG: that something is wrong
12/11/2016, 03:54 - Mom: no
12/11/2016, 03:54 - Cindy LEUNG: during the summer sometimes im sitting there and i start to feel tired and something is going to happen, and you seem to know
12/11/2016, 03:55 - Mom: i have seen u had many different scenario, so i can tell the difference
12/11/2016, 03:56 - Cindy LEUNG: so its not like a specific thing which i do?
12/11/2016, 03:56 - Mom: but normal 3rd person can't, they just think u fell asleep becuz ur eyes closed, head down and muscles sometimes relaxed
12/11/2016, 03:56 - Cindy LEUNG: right
12/11/2016, 03:57 - Cindy LEUNG: yah so my question is still am i falling alseep?
12/11/2016, 03:57 - Cindy LEUNG: even thought i don't think i am
12/11/2016, 03:57 - Cindy LEUNG: and im not even sure if i'm going into REM anymore
12/11/2016, 03:57 - Mom: u did have some very tiny thing i can notice of different from just sleeping, but normal person can't notice as i said i have observed ur situation for long time
12/11/2016, 03:58 - Mom: u looks like falling asleep, but i don't think ur sleeping
12/11/2016, 03:58 - Mom: and i don't know what's happening inside ur brain

12/11/2016, 06:53 - Cindy LEUNG: Like the one after bkf
12/11/2016, 06:53 - Mom: how many hrs of sleep in total 2 cycles?
12/11/2016, 06:53 - Mom: but if u drink alcohol after bkf, then u'll missed that nap?
12/11/2016, 06:54 - Cindy LEUNG: No
12/11/2016, 06:54 - Cindy LEUNG: What did I do yesterday
12/11/2016, 06:54 - Mom: how do i know ah?
12/11/2016, 06:55 - Cindy LEUNG: Similar, I think I slept for a while when I got to school
12/11/2016, 06:55 - Cindy LEUNG: But I woke up later at 8 yesterday
12/11/2016, 06:56 - Cindy LEUNG: And I would hv metabolised the alcohol I had yesterday really quickly cuz I was sweating like mad on Waterloo bridge
12/11/2016, 06:56 - Cindy LEUNG: At 10c
12/11/2016, 06:56 - Cindy LEUNG: What time did I sleep
12/11/2016, 06:56 - Mom: errr
12/11/2016, 06:57 - Cindy LEUNG: I hv record
12/11/2016, 06:58 - Mom: anyway, did that alcohol help in any way and how?
12/11/2016, 06:58 - Cindy LEUNG: 1253
12/11/2016, 06:58 - Cindy LEUNG: No I think it was too low dose
12/11/2016, 06:59 - Mom: ai ya, more alcohol everyday hurts ur liver ah
12/11/2016, 06:59 - Cindy LEUNG: no a glass of wine a day is good for your brain
12/11/2016, 06:59 - Mom: how much is one glass?
12/11/2016, 06:59 - Cindy LEUNG: like a wine glass?
12/11/2016, 06:59 - Cindy LEUNG: 100ml?
12/11/2016, 07:00 - Mom: and what type of wine? concentration?
12/11/2016, 07:00 - Cindy LEUNG: red
12/11/2016, 07:00 - Cindy LEUNG: yea its 125
12/11/2016, 07:00 - Cindy LEUNG: it has reservatrol
12/11/2016, 07:00 - Cindy LEUNG: grapes have reservatrol
12/11/2016, 07:00 - Mom: but u drank sage which is not red wine
12/11/2016, 07:01 - Cindy LEUNG: sake
12/11/2016, 07:01 - Mom: can't spell the word
12/11/2016, 07:01 - Cindy LEUNG: yea cuz i only had that
12/11/2016, 07:01 - Mom: so u shud eat more grapes everyday?
12/11/2016, 07:01 - Cindy LEUNG: the equivalent amount of grapes you would need to be would be like a truck load
12/11/2016, 07:02 - Cindy LEUNG: that's why they say a glass of wine is good for yo
12/11/2016, 07:02 - Mom: then u shud grow ur own grapes
12/11/2016, 07:02 - Mom: go to france, buy a vine yard
12/11/2016, 07:02 - Cindy LEUNG: like u would need to eat a truck of grapes everyday
12/11/2016, 07:02 - Cindy LEUNG: hahahaha
12/11/2016, 07:03 - Cindy LEUNG: then i would be very busy indeed
12/11/2016, 07:03 - Mom: perhaps this wud make u a successful business
12/11/2016, 07:03 - Cindy LEUNG: what? eating a truck of grapes?
12/11/2016, 07:04 - Mom: no i mean buy a wine yarda, grow grapes on it and sell the excess that u don't need
12/11/2016, 07:04 - Cindy LEUNG: (1) i don't know how to grow grapes
12/11/2016, 07:05 - Cindy LEUNG: (2) you can't do it yourself
12/11/2016, 07:05 - Mom: 1. learn it
12/11/2016, 07:05 - Mom: 2. why can't do it yourself?
12/11/2016, 07:05 - Cindy LEUNG: (3) that would not help depression cuz u have to be on vineyard alone forever
12/11/2016, 07:05 - Mom: need more staff, find someone to help
12/11/2016, 07:06 - Mom: omg
12/11/2016, 07:06 - Mom: i thought if ur busy in working with the wine yard, then no time to get depressed
12/11/2016, 07:06 - Cindy LEUNG: hmm
12/11/2016, 07:07 - Cindy LEUNG: no
12/11/2016, 07:08 - Mom: what r u going to do with this spare time in between ur sleep cycles?
12/11/2016, 07:08 - Mom: u did laundry already?
12/11/2016, 07:08 - Cindy LEUNG: no i only managed to sort all my clothes
12/11/2016, 07:08 - Mom: omg
12/11/2016, 07:08 - Cindy LEUNG: yess extra time
12/11/2016, 07:09 - Mom: i advise u to watch the macro video, i think u'll fall asleep rather quickly
12/11/2016, 07:09 - Cindy LEUNG: lulz thats very counter productive
12/11/2016, 07:09 - Cindy LEUNG: but tru dat
12/11/2016, 07:11 - Mom: this helps u to shorten the gap time between sleep cycles and perhaps after a few trial, u can have a continued sleep throughout the night??
12/11/2016, 07:11 - Cindy LEUNG: yah ok
12/11/2016, 07:12 - Mom: isn't this a good idea??
12/11/2016, 07:12 - Cindy LEUNG: but i still get really hot
12/11/2016, 07:12 - Mom: errr
12/11/2016, 07:12 - Mom: fan?

12/11/2016, 07:14 - Mom: u just feel hot at 3 am sleep? not other sleep cycles or after daytime nap?
12/11/2016, 07:15 - Mom: how's the length of ur individual cycles at night?
12/11/2016, 07:16 - Cindy LEUNG: what individual cycles?
12/11/2016, 07:16 - Mom: same time duration or first longer, shorter the rest
12/11/2016, 07:16 - Cindy LEUNG: [12-3], [4:30, 7]

16/11/2016, 13:37 - Cindy LEUNG: The verdict is out
16/11/2016, 13:38 - Cindy LEUNG: You can't make money through trading stocks.
16/11/2016, 13:38 - Cindy LEUNG: ‚òπ

16/11/2016, 13:44 - Cindy LEUNG: So u can't buy anything at bargain
16/11/2016, 13:44 - Mom: But the market is practically inefficient
16/11/2016, 13:44 - Cindy LEUNG: No the stock market is one of the most efficient markets
16/11/2016, 13:44 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz trading is mostly done by algos

17/11/2016, 02:18 - Cindy LEUNG: i had a bowl of grapes before i went to shower
17/11/2016, 02:18 - Cindy LEUNG: and when i came back
17/11/2016, 02:18 - Cindy LEUNG: i sat in front of my desk
17/11/2016, 02:19 - Cindy LEUNG: and then suddenly there was white smoke coming out of the bowl
17/11/2016, 02:19 - Cindy LEUNG: and a hissing sound
17/11/2016, 02:19 - Mom: Err
17/11/2016, 02:20 - Cindy LEUNG: so i thought the grape remains were setting off a fire
17/11/2016, 02:20 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz there was a lot of hissing sound and a lot of smoke
17/11/2016, 02:20 - Cindy LEUNG: but i couldn't get up out of my chair to take away the bowl
17/11/2016, 02:21 - Cindy LEUNG: i started shouting for someone to help cuz i thought there was a fire
17/11/2016, 02:21 - Cindy LEUNG: so this lasted for a whie
17/11/2016, 02:21 - Cindy LEUNG: while
17/11/2016, 02:21 - Cindy LEUNG: and then when the smoke subsided
17/11/2016, 02:21 - Cindy LEUNG: i was like phew
17/11/2016, 02:22 - Cindy LEUNG: and then i tried to move to get the bowl again, but it took a lot of effort (cuz my muscles were very weak)
17/11/2016, 02:22 - Cindy LEUNG: and then i remember this seen about dwarves
17/11/2016, 02:22 - Cindy LEUNG: it was a cartoon
17/11/2016, 02:23 - Cindy LEUNG: and then i heard this question: What's the name of this dwarve?
17/11/2016, 02:23 - Cindy LEUNG: it was the smallest dwarves
17/11/2016, 02:23 - Cindy LEUNG: dwarf
17/11/2016, 02:24 - Cindy LEUNG: the scene was also in style of cartoon, so like from disney's snow white and the seven dwarves
17/11/2016, 02:24 - Cindy LEUNG: and then
17/11/2016, 02:24 - Cindy LEUNG: and then, i heard the name of teh dwarf kept repeating in my head: normal, normal, normal, normal, normal
17/11/2016, 02:24 - Cindy LEUNG: (the dwarf was called normal)
17/11/2016, 02:25 - Cindy LEUNG: and then it stops
17/11/2016, 02:25 - Cindy LEUNG: and i see the bowl fo grapes on the desk in front of me
17/11/2016, 02:25 - Cindy LEUNG: i try to reach out for it again, I can't
17/11/2016, 02:26 - Cindy LEUNG: and this time, it starts singing a weird song whenever i try
17/11/2016, 02:26 - Cindy LEUNG: i know what's happening, so i'm like shut up shut up shut up shut up
17/11/2016, 02:27 - Cindy LEUNG: eventually i managed to move my arm and get the bowl and go wash it
17/11/2016, 02:27 - Cindy LEUNG: and then i went to sleep
17/11/2016, 02:27 - Cindy LEUNG: as in i went to the bed to sleep

17/11/2016, 02:38 - Cindy LEUNG: yea
17/11/2016, 02:38 - Cindy LEUNG: by weird dream, i don't mean vivid dream
17/11/2016, 02:38 - Mom: did u wake up naturally or forced by urself?
17/11/2016, 02:39 - Cindy LEUNG: naturally, i was gradually waking
17/11/2016, 02:39 - Cindy LEUNG: its not scary
17/11/2016, 02:39 - Cindy LEUNG: but like
17/11/2016, 02:39 - Mom: but with lots of weird dreams rite/
17/11/2016, 02:39 - Cindy LEUNG: so at one point, i thought i was three different people in the same body?
17/11/2016, 02:40 - Mom: how come three?
17/11/2016, 02:40 - Cindy LEUNG: like i had three different thoughts
17/11/2016, 02:40 - Cindy LEUNG: and like, i would try to recall some information
17/11/2016, 02:40 - Cindy LEUNG: and i would forget as person x, but i would know it as person y
17/11/2016, 02:41 - Mom: sorry, how do u knoe u had three persons inside? u saw it from a dream or whatever?
17/11/2016, 02:42 - Cindy LEUNG: no, i kept on going in and out of sleep
17/11/2016, 02:42 - Cindy LEUNG: and i thought i was three different people because i had the thoughts of three different people
17/11/2016, 02:42 - Cindy LEUNG: i didn't see myself visually as three different people
17/11/2016, 02:43 - Mom: how's those three different people?
17/11/2016, 02:43 - Mom: what're their personalities?
17/11/2016, 02:43 - Mom: how a, b, c think like?
17/11/2016, 02:44 - Cindy LEUNG: hurr i don't know how to explain, cuz i don't really remember
17/11/2016, 02:44 - Cindy LEUNG: but i just remember at one point i thought i was a wolf as well, cuz i could only howl
17/11/2016, 02:45 - Cindy LEUNG: and it was mostly just two people
17/11/2016, 02:45 - Cindy LEUNG: there was a brief moment with three before i got up
17/11/2016, 02:46 - Mom: were u scare then?

17/11/2016, 02:48 - Cindy LEUNG: i would say the grapes incident is more annoying

17/11/2016, 02:49 - Cindy LEUNG: a lot of the time i actually see them irl and they start singing
17/11/2016, 02:50 - Mom: u know it's ur brain having waken up before ur muscles, nothing really scary thingy

18/11/2016, 19:17 - Mom: not more intense heat?
18/11/2016, 19:17 - Cindy LEUNG: Not as much
18/11/2016, 19:17 - Mom: at mid-night?
18/11/2016, 19:17 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea not as much
18/11/2016, 19:18 - Cindy LEUNG: Not as much as previous four days
18/11/2016, 19:18 - Cindy LEUNG: It also actually got colder
18/11/2016, 19:18 - Mom: so the intense heat wud probably be a matter abt the menstruation
18/11/2016, 19:18 - Cindy LEUNG: It s like below 10 now
18/11/2016, 19:18 - Cindy LEUNG: Maybe
18/11/2016, 19:18 - Cindy LEUNG: I think I had an infection
18/11/2016, 19:19 - Mom: what infection?
18/11/2016, 19:19 - Mom: flu?
18/11/2016, 19:19 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz my vagina was like really dry and itchy
18/11/2016, 19:19 - Mom: probably
18/11/2016, 19:19 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea rite
18/11/2016, 19:19 - Mom: did u ask the gp to prescribe u med?
18/11/2016, 19:20 - Cindy LEUNG: No why
18/11/2016, 19:20 - Cindy LEUNG: I just went to take blood
18/11/2016, 19:20 - Cindy LEUNG: And the gp was different so he grilled me
18/11/2016, 19:20 - Mom: there're ointment which can relieve virginal infection
18/11/2016, 19:20 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea I know
18/11/2016, 19:20 - Cindy LEUNG: I put 974
18/11/2016, 19:21 - Mom: does it work?
18/11/2016, 19:21 - Cindy LEUNG: And then its less itchy now
18/11/2016, 19:21 - Cindy LEUNG: Yes
18/11/2016, 19:21 - Mom: ok

18/11/2016, 19:21 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea I'm eating right now
18/11/2016, 19:21 - Cindy LEUNG: But wow
18/11/2016, 19:22 - Cindy LEUNG: Genitals influence the body so much
18/11/2016, 19:22 - Mom: why not?
18/11/2016, 19:22 - Cindy LEUNG: Even Ur arm does not influence Ur body that much
18/11/2016, 19:23 - Cindy LEUNG: Soooo
18/11/2016, 19:24 - Cindy LEUNG: What possibly happened was that I had an infection
18/11/2016, 19:24 - Cindy LEUNG: And that made me more awake and less tired?
18/11/2016, 19:24 - Mom: cuz there's an opening, and the lining there r so easily be infected by bacteria
18/11/2016, 19:24 - Cindy LEUNG: I guess it's on the outside though
18/11/2016, 19:24 - Cindy LEUNG: Its not the inside.
18/11/2016, 19:24 - Mom: ur guess is so creative
18/11/2016, 19:25 - Cindy LEUNG: Wow the sarcasm
18/11/2016, 19:25 - Mom: u said u slept through the lectures today, did u actually feel physically tired or mentally tired or nothing ?
18/11/2016, 19:26 - Cindy LEUNG: I felt tired in the sense that I sat in the chair this morning and it was 9:25 and I felt like I was so tired I didn't want to get up and move
18/11/2016, 19:27 - Mom: because u didn't sleep well last night?
18/11/2016, 19:27 - Cindy LEUNG: No
18/11/2016, 19:27 - Cindy LEUNG: No difference from other night s
18/11/2016, 19:28 - Mom: so how abt the rest sleeping at lectures, same feeling ?
18/11/2016, 19:28 - Cindy LEUNG: Erm I just fell asleep without knowing for those
18/11/2016, 19:28 - Mom: hmm
18/11/2016, 19:28 - Cindy LEUNG: Like by the time I wake up
18/11/2016, 19:29 - Cindy LEUNG: I realise my head is in a strange position
18/11/2016, 19:29 - Cindy LEUNG: And then I go
18/11/2016, 19:29 - Cindy LEUNG: Oh I fell asleep
18/11/2016, 19:29 - Cindy LEUNG: Which slide is he on?
18/11/2016, 19:29 - Mom: sleep for whole lecture like an hr or 40 mins ?
18/11/2016, 19:30 - Cindy LEUNG: No I think 10-15 mins
18/11/2016, 19:30 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz I slept quite a few times in the first one
18/11/2016, 19:30 - Cindy LEUNG: I actually slept a lot today now I think abt it
18/11/2016, 19:31 - Cindy LEUNG: I did sleep after breakfast
18/11/2016, 19:31 - Mom: wow, 10-15 mins x 3 or 4 times which means the whole lecture hr
18/11/2016, 19:31 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea I slept the whole lecture
18/11/2016, 19:31 - Cindy LEUNG: Listened probably to only 5-10 mins
18/11/2016, 19:32 - Cindy LEUNG: I slept immediately after breakfast
18/11/2016, 19:32 - Cindy LEUNG: And then I had a rem episode before I left this morning
18/11/2016, 19:32 - Mom: what if u didn't eat?
18/11/2016, 19:32 - Cindy LEUNG: And then I slept in the cafe when I got to lse
18/11/2016, 19:32 - Mom: u mean dream after bkf this morning
18/11/2016, 19:32 - Cindy LEUNG: And then I slept abt three times in first hr of lecture
18/11/2016, 19:33 - Cindy LEUNG: No dream
18/11/2016, 19:33 - Cindy LEUNG: None of these had dreams
18/11/2016, 19:33 - Cindy LEUNG: Except
18/11/2016, 19:33 - Mom: no dream then no rem
18/11/2016, 19:33 - Cindy LEUNG: The one I had in the chair
18/11/2016, 19:33 - Cindy LEUNG: I had dreams
18/11/2016, 19:33 - Mom: ok
18/11/2016, 19:33 - Cindy LEUNG: And I thought a lot of shit were happening in my head
18/11/2016, 19:34 - Cindy LEUNG: And then I also slept through most of the second half of the lecture
18/11/2016, 19:34 - Cindy LEUNG: Which was after lunch
18/11/2016, 19:34 - Mom: omg
18/11/2016, 19:34 - Mom: these don't look like sleep attacks woow
18/11/2016, 19:34 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea they don't
18/11/2016, 19:35 - Mom: basically, u can stick to ur bed today if u didn't go to lse
18/11/2016, 19:35 - Cindy LEUNG: But this sleeping pattern is more normal than past four days
18/11/2016, 19:35 - Mom: how's past four days' sleeping pattern
18/11/2016, 19:36 - Cindy LEUNG: Like it would be impossible for me to read two chapters of a boring textbook and spend six hrs on a pset

18/11/2016, 19:37 - Mom: ur condition for past four days might be a direct effect of ur hormone during menstruation

18/11/2016, 19:52 - Cindy LEUNG: I was so much better in January last year
18/11/2016, 19:52 - Mom: yea, u said so
18/11/2016, 19:52 - Cindy LEUNG: I got my ears pierced around the same time
18/11/2016, 19:53 - Cindy LEUNG: I always wondered how I didn't get an infection
18/11/2016, 19:53 - Cindy LEUNG: I just washed it everyday with saline
18/11/2016, 19:54 - Mom: isn't that normal not getting an infection ?
18/11/2016, 19:54 - Cindy LEUNG: I dunno all my friends said they had infection really easy
18/11/2016, 19:54 - Mom: err..
18/11/2016, 19:54 - Cindy LEUNG: But they did it with a gun
18/11/2016, 19:55 - Cindy LEUNG: I pierced with needle so I thought I had a cleaner cut
18/11/2016, 19:55 - Mom: see there's a difference, u can't just compare the result directly
18/11/2016, 19:56 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea I guess
18/11/2016, 19:56 - Cindy LEUNG: Maybe if I get like another infection I'll sleep less again
18/11/2016, 19:56 - Cindy LEUNG: Hmmm
18/11/2016, 19:57 - Mom: how r u going to do with that infection?
18/11/2016, 19:57 - Mom: u plan to initiate one?
18/11/2016, 19:57 - Cindy LEUNG: U mean how to get a controlled infection?
18/11/2016, 19:57 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea I would like to test if possible
18/11/2016, 19:57 - Mom: omg
18/11/2016, 19:58 - Cindy LEUNG: So far I can think of getting another piercing
18/11/2016, 19:58 - Cindy LEUNG: Getting a tattoo
18/11/2016, 19:58 - Mom: no way
18/11/2016, 19:58 - Mom: nvm tattoo
18/11/2016, 19:58 - Mom: NEVER
18/11/2016, 19:59 - Cindy LEUNG: I don't hv enough tattoable skin
18/11/2016, 19:59 - Cindy LEUNG: To stay awake forever
18/11/2016, 19:59 - Cindy LEUNG: So I also thought abt this yesterday
18/11/2016, 19:59 - Mom: if it's the infection which can help u turn more alert, r u going to incur and maintain controlled infection all the time ?
18/11/2016, 20:00 - Cindy LEUNG: But hv I noticed that I seem to heal faster under stress?
18/11/2016, 20:00 - Cindy LEUNG: Like if stress was a problem
18/11/2016, 20:00 - Cindy LEUNG: Then I should hv improved at much faster rate over the summer
18/11/2016, 20:00 - Mom: what heal faster ?
18/11/2016, 20:01 - Cindy LEUNG: Like sleep situation?
18/11/2016, 20:01 - Mom: did u hurt or get injured?
18/11/2016, 20:01 - Cindy LEUNG: Arguably we can say that my sleep situation is improving slowly
18/11/2016, 20:01 - Cindy LEUNG: This I what I meant by heal
18/11/2016, 20:01 - Cindy LEUNG: Even with the cataplexy
18/11/2016, 20:02 - Cindy LEUNG: I don't think its changed a great deal
18/11/2016, 20:02 - Cindy LEUNG: But I hv dropped less than last November
18/11/2016, 20:02 - Mom: i wud guess it's ur sns working too hard, or becoming hyper that makes ur hormone imbalance
18/11/2016, 20:02 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea but if that is true
18/11/2016, 20:03 - Cindy LEUNG: Then I should hv improved at faster rate over summer
18/11/2016, 20:03 - Cindy LEUNG: But I feel like I experienced more change over these 8 weeks
18/11/2016, 20:04 - Cindy LEUNG: Like what im suggesting is that it seems to improve faster under slight stress
18/11/2016, 20:04 - Mom: but ur infection appeared just last week rite, so it doesn't make sense for the changes since u went back to london
18/11/2016, 20:06 - Cindy LEUNG: Hmm m
18/11/2016, 20:06 - Cindy LEUNG: That's true
18/11/2016, 20:06 - Mom: vw plans to cut hugh jobs, mostly in america and germany
18/11/2016, 20:06 - Cindy LEUNG: So before this week u think my situation abt the same as summer?
18/11/2016, 20:07 - Mom: no
18/11/2016, 20:07 - Mom: summer is better
18/11/2016, 20:07 - Cindy LEUNG: Huh
18/11/2016, 20:07 - Cindy LEUNG: Really
18/11/2016, 20:09 - Cindy LEUNG: So far my weight has not changed, I still experience muscle weakness, i still get paralysis for no reason, still get weak and collapse with humour stimulus and still sleep in two blocks
18/11/2016, 20:09 - Mom: i was thinking whether ur sleeping in lectures/class is a kind of conditioning because u seem don't like those lecturers in the very beginning
18/11/2016, 20:09 - Cindy LEUNG: No I had finance today
18/11/2016, 20:09 - Cindy LEUNG: I actually like the lecturer
18/11/2016, 20:09 - Mom: hmm
18/11/2016, 20:09 - Cindy LEUNG: But maybe the theatre is too comfortable
18/11/2016, 20:09 - Cindy LEUNG: Is like a musical theatre
18/11/2016, 20:10 - Mom: that's why i asked if u were actually physically tired or mentally tired only
18/11/2016, 20:10 - Cindy LEUNG: Physically this morning I didn't want to ger up
18/11/2016, 20:10 - Cindy LEUNG: And then I think the rest was mostly mental
18/11/2016, 20:12 - Cindy LEUNG: I was with my actuarial friend
18/11/2016, 20:12 - Cindy LEUNG: She said I slept through the whole thing
18/11/2016, 20:12 - Cindy LEUNG: And then I had soup noodles for lunch
18/11/2016, 20:12 - Cindy LEUNG: And then I slept again in round 2
18/11/2016, 20:13 - Cindy LEUNG: I was ok for macro though

18/11/2016, 20:14 - Mom: when did u eat lunch?
18/11/2016, 20:14 - Cindy LEUNG: And then I walked back home to get my med record a
18/11/2016, 20:14 - Cindy LEUNG: I ate lunch at 1

18/11/2016, 20:15 - Cindy LEUNG: U see
18/11/2016, 20:15 - Mom: u took lunch at 1, then slept for like 20 mins after lunch
18/11/2016, 20:15 - Mom: so u shud have slept at 2-3 lecture
18/11/2016, 20:16 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea exactly
18/11/2016, 20:16 - Cindy LEUNG: For 30 mins or so
18/11/2016, 20:16 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz it takes time
18/11/2016, 20:16 - Cindy LEUNG: I even had a coffee before the lecture
18/11/2016, 20:16 - Mom: no use
18/11/2016, 20:16 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea no use
18/11/2016, 20:17 - Cindy LEUNG: So as long as I eat, I will sleep
18/11/2016, 20:17 - Mom: coffee to u and me is no longer a stimulant
18/11/2016, 20:17 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea
18/11/2016, 20:17 - Mom: this is the point, why eating trigger sleep
18/11/2016, 20:17 - Cindy LEUNG: Saah
18/11/2016, 20:17 - Cindy LEUNG: Im waiting to ask the neurologist
18/11/2016, 20:18 - Cindy LEUNG: I feel like my body is in this condition where it doesn't need to eat as well
18/11/2016, 20:18 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz I don't get hungry
18/11/2016, 20:18 - Cindy LEUNG: And I never lose weight
18/11/2016, 20:19 - Mom: have u not eat for a whole day
18/11/2016, 20:19 - Cindy LEUNG: I always hv bkf
18/11/2016, 20:19 - Cindy LEUNG: But I could probably not eat for the day
18/11/2016, 20:19 - Cindy LEUNG: These days I just hv a chocolate bar and coffee for lunch
18/11/2016, 20:20 - Cindy LEUNG: I hv scramble eggs for breakfast
18/11/2016, 20:20 - Cindy LEUNG: I think I might just change to avocado
18/11/2016, 20:20 - Cindy LEUNG: And then chocolate bar for lunch
18/11/2016, 20:20 - Mom: chocolate bar and coffee still provoke sleep
18/11/2016, 20:20 - Cindy LEUNG: No those r less likely
18/11/2016, 20:21 - Cindy LEUNG: So I think cuz I ate less
18/11/2016, 20:21 - Cindy LEUNG: But I still sleep sometimes
18/11/2016, 20:21 - Mom: eggs r good, don't advise to cut it
18/11/2016, 20:21 - Cindy LEUNG: But avocado is leas
18/11/2016, 20:21 - Cindy LEUNG: Eggs is definitely sleep inducing
18/11/2016, 20:21 - Mom: same duration of sleep?
18/11/2016, 20:22 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea 15-30 min
18/11/2016, 20:22 - Cindy LEUNG: Dinner not so much
18/11/2016, 20:22 - Mom: can't be the case, as eggs r rich in protein not carbs
18/11/2016, 20:22 - Cindy LEUNG: Its not carb then
18/11/2016, 20:22 - Cindy LEUNG: Or protein

19/11/2016, 12:52 - Cindy LEUNG: at hk rate
19/11/2016, 12:52 - Mom: cuz those charges on spotify were shown on my hang seng bank credit card instead of hsbc credit card
19/11/2016, 12:52 - Cindy LEUNG: huh do they usually show on the hsbc card?
19/11/2016, 12:53 - Mom: yea
19/11/2016, 12:53 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz i subscribed over 3 years ago

19/11/2016, 12:58 - Mom: but why wud spotify charges my hang seng bank credit card?
19/11/2016, 12:58 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz i use paypal to pay for my spotify subscription
19/11/2016, 12:59 - Cindy LEUNG: so the transaction is done through paypal and u changed ur card to hang seng bank on pp?
19/11/2016, 12:59 - Mom: but at the time of subscription, u shud have select the hsbc cc on paypal, not hang seng bank cc rite?

19/11/2016, 16:46 - Cindy LEUNG: Halfway
19/11/2016, 16:46 - Cindy LEUNG: And then I loss track of the story and gave up
19/11/2016, 16:46 - Cindy LEUNG: Ok so it's not just economics or finance
19/11/2016, 16:46 - Mom: u did a lot of work in the morning?

19/11/2016, 16:49 - Mom: yea i know
19/11/2016, 16:49 - Cindy LEUNG: I sat in the cafe to finish my reading
19/11/2016, 16:50 - Cindy LEUNG: It was only four pages
19/11/2016, 16:50 - Cindy LEUNG: But I still fell asleep
19/11/2016, 16:50 - Mom: rest of the day?
19/11/2016, 16:50 - Cindy LEUNG: Er and then I woke up briefly
19/11/2016, 16:51 - Cindy LEUNG: And then went to lecture
19/11/2016, 16:51 - Cindy LEUNG: And then napped at least three times there in an hr
19/11/2016, 16:51 - Cindy LEUNG: And then I went to hv lunch
19/11/2016, 16:51 - Cindy LEUNG: After that I slept through the whole of the second lecture as well
19/11/2016, 16:52 - Cindy LEUNG: And then I didn't sleep until waiting for the gp
19/11/2016, 16:52 - Mom: how long that period last for?
19/11/2016, 16:53 - Cindy LEUNG: I had two hrs of class
19/11/2016, 16:53 - Cindy LEUNG: And then one hr of walking
19/11/2016, 16:53 - Cindy LEUNG: So I dont think this gap counts
19/11/2016, 16:53 - Mom: i mean the time period u didn't sleep?
19/11/2016, 16:53 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea
19/11/2016, 16:53 - Cindy LEUNG: Exactly
19/11/2016, 16:54 - Mom: did u sleep at the time u saw the gp?
19/11/2016, 16:54 - Cindy LEUNG: No I was walking at 6km/h for an hr before
19/11/2016, 16:55 - Mom: i dunno if this speed is fast or not?
19/11/2016, 16:55 - Cindy LEUNG: Ok in other words I did a lot of exercise
19/11/2016, 16:55 - Mom: did u sweat?
19/11/2016, 16:55 - Cindy LEUNG: Look I dont think this gap counta
19/11/2016, 16:55 - Mom: a lot
19/11/2016, 16:56 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz I was talking for first 2 hrs and then I was walking

19/11/2016, 16:56 - Mom: okok
19/11/2016, 16:56 - Cindy LEUNG: So I fell asleep briefly while I was waiting
19/11/2016, 16:56 - Mom: did u sweat a lot after walking
19/11/2016, 16:56 - Cindy LEUNG: Yes
19/11/2016, 16:56 - Cindy LEUNG: Like any normal person woyld
19/11/2016, 16:57 - Mom: ok
19/11/2016, 16:57 - Cindy LEUNG: And then after that

19/11/2016, 16:58 - Mom: what abt after dinner? can u work ?
19/11/2016, 16:58 - Cindy LEUNG: Hmm I don't think I did any work

19/11/2016, 17:01 - Mom: did u drink more coffee these days?
19/11/2016, 17:01 - Cindy LEUNG: Erm I guess, maybe like one occasionally
19/11/2016, 17:02 - Cindy LEUNG: Or else I hv nothing to drink
19/11/2016, 17:02 - Mom: did u notice any difference abt ur sleepiness before and after drinking coffee?
19/11/2016, 17:02 - Cindy LEUNG: No
19/11/2016, 17:03 - Cindy LEUNG: I noticed a difference between monday-thur
19/11/2016, 17:03 - Mom: no more sleepy
19/11/2016, 17:03 - Cindy LEUNG: And friday-sat
19/11/2016, 17:03 - Cindy LEUNG: Now
19/11/2016, 17:04 - Mom: this is weird if nothing done differently between these two blocks of days
19/11/2016, 17:04 - Cindy LEUNG: Yah
19/11/2016, 17:04 - Cindy LEUNG: Very weird
19/11/2016, 17:05 - Mom: i'm guessing u had adrenal problem
19/11/2016, 17:06 - Cindy LEUNG: Look I just watched 21 mins of Southpark
19/11/2016, 17:06 - Cindy LEUNG: I laughed at a few parts
19/11/2016, 17:06 - Cindy LEUNG: But no collapse
19/11/2016, 17:06 - Mom: is that funny?
19/11/2016, 17:06 - Cindy LEUNG: I dunno I'm starting to doubt myself
19/11/2016, 17:07 - Mom: doubt what?
19/11/2016, 17:07 - Cindy LEUNG: like i tell people that i collapse if i find things funny
19/11/2016, 17:07 - Cindy LEUNG: and then i just watched something funny
19/11/2016, 17:07 - Cindy LEUNG: and then nothing happened
19/11/2016, 17:07 - Cindy LEUNG: :(
19/11/2016, 17:08 - Mom: i'm guessing if ur body is having problem replenishing ur cortisol level so that ur energy can't be maintained through the week
19/11/2016, 17:08 - Cindy LEUNG: hurr
19/11/2016, 17:08 - Mom: don't feel happy if u didn't collapse watching funny thing
19/11/2016, 17:08 - Cindy LEUNG: but what about the collapsing
19/11/2016, 17:09 - Mom: u shud feel happy abt it
19/11/2016, 17:09 - Cindy LEUNG: like i used to collapse while watching pewdiepie
19/11/2016, 17:09 - Cindy LEUNG: remember
19/11/2016, 17:09 - Cindy LEUNG: but now i don't even blink
19/11/2016, 17:09 - Mom: yea
19/11/2016, 17:09 - Cindy LEUNG: so did he get less funny?
19/11/2016, 17:09 - Cindy LEUNG: or did i improve?
19/11/2016, 17:09 - Mom: hmm
19/11/2016, 17:09 - Mom: do u find it uninteresting?
19/11/2016, 17:09 - Cindy LEUNG: or maybe i just don't find stupid things funny anymore
19/11/2016, 17:10 - Cindy LEUNG: idk
19/11/2016, 17:10 - Cindy LEUNG: i don't even know what change
19/11/2016, 17:10 - Cindy LEUNG: but if i talk to emos
19/11/2016, 17:10 - Cindy LEUNG: i can still drop really quickly
19/11/2016, 17:10 - Mom: now?
19/11/2016, 17:10 - Mom: through whatsapp?
19/11/2016, 17:10 - Cindy LEUNG: i think so
19/11/2016, 17:10 - Cindy LEUNG: mabe
19/11/2016, 17:10 - Cindy LEUNG: never tried
19/11/2016, 17:11 - Mom: hmm
19/11/2016, 17:11 - Cindy LEUNG: she usually says quite funny things
19/11/2016, 17:11 - Mom: she has the charisma to make ppl wow
19/11/2016, 17:11 - Cindy LEUNG: its  been a long time i found anything really funny tbh
19/11/2016, 17:12 - Cindy LEUNG: i collapse in japanese class
19/11/2016, 17:12 - Mom: why?
19/11/2016, 17:12 - Mom: find funny things ?
19/11/2016, 17:12 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz we watch the video
19/11/2016, 17:12 - Cindy LEUNG: and they speak really unnatural
19/11/2016, 17:12 - Cindy LEUNG: and make lame jokes
19/11/2016, 17:12 - Cindy LEUNG: and i guess the class is fun in general
19/11/2016, 17:13 - Cindy LEUNG: its like context dependent
19/11/2016, 17:13 - Mom: ic
19/11/2016, 17:13 - Cindy LEUNG: even the very first time wasn't exactly funny
19/11/2016, 17:13 - Cindy LEUNG: i remembered the dog's name
19/11/2016, 17:14 - Cindy LEUNG: and then felt happy
19/11/2016, 17:14 - Cindy LEUNG: yea its more like hapy
19/11/2016, 17:14 - Cindy LEUNG: happy
19/11/2016, 17:14 - Cindy LEUNG: than funny
19/11/2016, 17:14 - Cindy LEUNG: gosh this is getting more depressing
19/11/2016, 17:14 - Mom: why depressing
19/11/2016, 17:14 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz i get muscle weakness whenever i feel happy
19/11/2016, 17:15 - Mom: is that the real situation
19/11/2016, 17:15 - Cindy LEUNG: this makes sense though
19/11/2016, 17:15 - Cindy LEUNG: i fall more around my friends
19/11/2016, 17:15 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz i'm happy to be with friends
19/11/2016, 17:15 - Cindy LEUNG: i also fall when i just see certain people
19/11/2016, 17:16 - Cindy LEUNG: even when i have no interaction with them
19/11/2016, 17:16 - Mom: who r they?
19/11/2016, 17:16 - Mom: close friends ?
19/11/2016, 17:16 - Cindy LEUNG: like people i like to hang out with i guess
19/11/2016, 17:17 - Mom: so that's ur expectation of feeling happy
19/11/2016, 17:17 - Cindy LEUNG: like people i like more than others?
19/11/2016, 17:17 - Cindy LEUNG: so i'm basically happy to see them
19/11/2016, 17:17 - Cindy LEUNG: or like
19/11/2016, 17:17 - Cindy LEUNG: when i'm having an interesting conversation
19/11/2016, 17:17 - Cindy LEUNG: like that time with the med student
19/11/2016, 17:18 - Mom: collapse before that med student?
19/11/2016, 17:18 - Cindy LEUNG: yea i collapsed when we left the ramen shope
19/11/2016, 17:18 - Cindy LEUNG: that's when he saw me collapse onto the floor
19/11/2016, 17:19 - Cindy LEUNG: yeah so i think i collapse during events with high happiness
19/11/2016, 17:19 - Cindy LEUNG: i also collapse more at school in kgv
19/11/2016, 17:20 - Cindy LEUNG: i think cuz i saw my friends every day right
19/11/2016, 17:20 - Cindy LEUNG: and we did a lot more fun stuff
19/11/2016, 17:20 - Mom: i get what u meant
19/11/2016, 17:20 - Cindy LEUNG: and the few times i collapsed on the floor in london
19/11/2016, 17:20 - Cindy LEUNG: now i think about it
19/11/2016, 17:21 - Cindy LEUNG: i was from having a fun convo
19/11/2016, 17:21 - Mom: with friends
19/11/2016, 17:21 - Cindy LEUNG: with my room mates from last year
19/11/2016, 17:21 - Mom: ic
19/11/2016, 17:23 - Cindy LEUNG: yea i also collapsed once outside of eat tokyo
19/11/2016, 17:23 - Cindy LEUNG: and that was conversation related as well
19/11/2016, 17:24 - Cindy LEUNG: so waht can we say
19/11/2016, 17:24 - Cindy LEUNG: i actually found pewdiepie funny in teh beginning and now i don't
19/11/2016, 17:24 - Mom: also felt happy during conversation
19/11/2016, 17:24 - Cindy LEUNG: yeah that was the time i was talking to the guy who sees things
19/11/2016, 17:25 - Mom: what did he say abt ur collapse?
19/11/2016, 17:25 - Cindy LEUNG: well then we sat in starbucks and he googled it for a while
19/11/2016, 17:25 - Cindy LEUNG: lol
19/11/2016, 17:26 - Mom: i thought he was thinking that u saw things which made u collapse
19/11/2016, 17:26 - Cindy LEUNG: no, i had to tell them what i have after i collapse right
19/11/2016, 17:27 - Mom: hmm
19/11/2016, 17:27 - Cindy LEUNG: oh yeah i also had muscle weakness the first time i met maya
19/11/2016, 17:27 - Cindy LEUNG: she was really weird
19/11/2016, 17:27 - Mom: who's maya?
19/11/2016, 17:27 - Cindy LEUNG: some person i met last year
19/11/2016, 17:27 - Mom: how's special abt her?
19/11/2016, 17:28 - Cindy LEUNG: they're all like slightly racist, but in denial
19/11/2016, 17:29 - Mom: so why u felt muscle weakness when seeing her
19/11/2016, 17:29 - Cindy LEUNG: oh yah
19/11/2016, 17:29 - Cindy LEUNG: she's really weird, its like she seems like a very nice person
19/11/2016, 17:29 - Cindy LEUNG: and then she says really horrible things
19/11/2016, 17:29 - Mom: afterall, i don't think u need to tell everybody ur health condition even after collapse cuz that's ur privacy
19/11/2016, 17:30 - Cindy LEUNG: and then she asks you whether you want to go to church on sunday
19/11/2016, 17:30 - Mom: this is not that abnormal if she just ask u to go to church
19/11/2016, 17:30 - Cindy LEUNG: but she saays really horrible things
19/11/2016, 17:31 - Mom: like what?
19/11/2016, 17:31 - Cindy LEUNG: i just found teh irony really funny
19/11/2016, 17:31 - Mom: sorry don't get it
19/11/2016, 17:31 - Cindy LEUNG: ofc ofc
19/11/2016, 17:31 - Cindy LEUNG: i'll try to think of a better example
19/11/2016, 17:32 - Cindy LEUNG: that's like me in doctor's office
19/11/2016, 17:32 - Cindy LEUNG: the other convos were like
19/11/2016, 17:33 - Cindy LEUNG: there was that time we ranked all the girls in the pub
19/11/2016, 17:33 - Cindy LEUNG: that was fun
19/11/2016, 17:34 - Cindy LEUNG: and then there was that time, that guy talked about his relationship problems
19/11/2016, 17:34 - Cindy LEUNG: that was also funny
19/11/2016, 17:35 - Cindy LEUNG: they're all this sort of stuff
19/11/2016, 17:35 - Mom: ok, these convos all made u collapse rite
19/11/2016, 17:35 - Cindy LEUNG: yea
19/11/2016, 17:36 - Cindy LEUNG: oh
19/11/2016, 17:36 - Cindy LEUNG: anime soc agm
19/11/2016, 17:36 - Cindy LEUNG: that was really funny
19/11/2016, 17:36 - Cindy LEUNG: u can imagine what people would say at agm right
19/11/2016, 17:36 - Mom: u felt happy again
19/11/2016, 17:36 - Cindy LEUNG: but the context makes it funny
19/11/2016, 17:37 - Cindy LEUNG: oh yeah agms are quite fun
19/11/2016, 17:37 - Mom: have u collapse
19/11/2016, 17:37 - Cindy LEUNG: when?where?
19/11/2016, 17:37 - Mom: anime soc agm
19/11/2016, 17:37 - Cindy LEUNG: oh yeah
19/11/2016, 17:38 - Cindy LEUNG: they also did running man
19/11/2016, 17:38 - Cindy LEUNG: so that was fun
19/11/2016, 17:38 - Mom: omg
19/11/2016, 17:38 - Cindy LEUNG: yeah
19/11/2016, 17:38 - Cindy LEUNG: i also went to gaming if u wanna compare
19/11/2016, 17:39 - Cindy LEUNG: they were also fun people
19/11/2016, 17:39 - Cindy LEUNG: but i didn't collapse cuz i didn't game and i didn't know what they were talking about
19/11/2016, 17:39 - Mom: u found a pattern finally
19/11/2016, 17:39 - Cindy LEUNG: i think we have
19/11/2016, 17:39 - Cindy LEUNG: i also never collapse when i went out to club
19/11/2016, 17:40 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz inherently i still believe that clubbing is only a stress relieve exercise
19/11/2016, 17:40 - Cindy LEUNG: like masturbing or running
19/11/2016, 17:41 - Cindy LEUNG: i definitely collapsed when we played when cyril and celina came down
19/11/2016, 17:42 - Cindy LEUNG: so the verdict is that i can't be a happy person?
19/11/2016, 17:42 - Cindy LEUNG: seems like if i don't want to fall i eliminate all of this
19/11/2016, 17:42 - Cindy LEUNG: that's why they give antidepressant
19/11/2016, 17:42 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz it turns u into a flat now
19/11/2016, 17:42 - Cindy LEUNG: flat line
19/11/2016, 17:43 - Cindy LEUNG: like i am now, by minimizing social relations
19/11/2016, 17:45 - Mom: antidepressant is to regulate ur neurotransmitters to make ppl feel more happy but the fact is ur a happy person at the time
19/11/2016, 17:45 - Mom: *all
19/11/2016, 17:46 - Cindy LEUNG: u sure, the med student said it turns u into a flat line
19/11/2016, 17:46 - Cindy LEUNG: plus 'happy' is a really open word
19/11/2016, 17:46 - Cindy LEUNG: its worse than finding things funny
19/11/2016, 17:48 - Mom: if u think antidepressant turns u into a flat line, that mean if u took it, u won't feel happy meeting ur friends?
19/11/2016, 17:48 - Cindy LEUNG: possible
19/11/2016, 17:48 - Cindy LEUNG: or i'll be like less responsive to stuff?
19/11/2016, 17:48 - Cindy LEUNG: like what happened with pewdiepie
19/11/2016, 17:49 - Mom: if u can't have feeling or emotions, what's the point of keeping social relationship?
19/11/2016, 17:49 - Cindy LEUNG: i remember i even collapsed in james abdey's lectures a few times
19/11/2016, 17:49 - Cindy LEUNG: hahaha he was weird and did funny things
19/11/2016, 17:49 - Mom: and what's the point of taking antidepressant?
19/11/2016, 17:49 - Cindy LEUNG: so u don't kill urself
19/11/2016, 17:50 - Cindy LEUNG: lol
19/11/2016, 17:50 - Cindy LEUNG: yeah i don't think i should take them
19/11/2016, 17:50 - Mom: in turn, i wud say those antidepressant makes ppl even more depressed
19/11/2016, 17:50 - Mom: or having more negative thoughts
19/11/2016, 17:50 - Cindy LEUNG: yea that's why they kill themselves
19/11/2016, 17:51 - Cindy LEUNG: maybe i should try cbt
19/11/2016, 17:51 - Cindy LEUNG: but i don't have depression
19/11/2016, 17:51 - Cindy LEUNG: no i don't have serious depression
19/11/2016, 17:52 - Mom: u don't have depression, but ur collapse frustrates u meeting ppl and searching for happy memories
19/11/2016, 17:52 - Mom: this is the proble
19/11/2016, 17:52 - Mom: problem
19/11/2016, 17:52 - Cindy LEUNG: yeah
19/11/2016, 17:52 - Cindy LEUNG: its like
19/11/2016, 17:52 - Cindy LEUNG: my happyiness budget constriant move inwards
19/11/2016, 17:53 - Cindy LEUNG: and there's like a depression threshold
19/11/2016, 17:53 - Cindy LEUNG: like if u get too little happyness
19/11/2016, 17:53 - Cindy LEUNG: then u might fall under the threshold
19/11/2016, 17:54 - Cindy LEUNG: and if u're permanently under the threshold, like if u're in poverty, u become a depressed person
19/11/2016, 17:54 - Cindy LEUNG: in that case u should take antidepressants
19/11/2016, 17:55 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz that would lower the depression constraint for you
19/11/2016, 17:55 - Cindy LEUNG: and u would not have to kill urself
19/11/2016, 17:55 - Cindy LEUNG: i can actually draw this out on a graph =.=
19/11/2016, 17:56 - Cindy LEUNG: u know two people won the nobel prize for just representing utility in numbers?
19/11/2016, 17:56 - Cindy LEUNG: my happyness budget constraint deserves a nobel prize too
19/11/2016, 17:57 - Mom: u can try write a paper on it
19/11/2016, 17:57 - Cindy LEUNG: i think i would collapse if i was actually saying all of this in person
19/11/2016, 17:58 - Mom: ai ya, write ur paper first to see if ur theory can move the panel at nobel prize committee
19/11/2016, 17:58 - Cindy LEUNG: so u see my point was to demonstrate what i find funny
19/11/2016, 17:58 - Mom: u had gone too far
19/11/2016, 17:59 - Cindy LEUNG: u see what i just said was funny right
19/11/2016, 17:59 - Cindy LEUNG: but i don't know how to pinpoint at which point it is funny
19/11/2016, 17:59 - Mom: so u just collapsed?
19/11/2016, 17:59 - Cindy LEUNG: not really
19/11/2016, 17:59 - Cindy LEUNG: i told u jokes are less funny on whatsapp
19/11/2016, 18:00 - Mom: don't think it rlly funny as i have been srsly discussing a medical condition with u
19/11/2016, 18:00 - Cindy LEUNG: what u didn't find the happyness budget constraint even a little bit amusing
19/11/2016, 18:01 - Mom: i appreciate ur thought or idea
19/11/2016, 18:01 - Mom: i'm waiting to see ur complete thesis
19/11/2016, 18:01 - Cindy LEUNG: but its the thought that its like an interesting idea
19/11/2016, 18:01 - Mom: yea, interesting but not funny
19/11/2016, 18:01 - Cindy LEUNG: like i never thought if u put a pineapple and a pen together
19/11/2016, 18:02 - Cindy LEUNG: oh yeah i collapsed at the pineapple pen joke as well
19/11/2016, 18:02 - Cindy LEUNG: but then if i showed teh gp that, he'd be like wtf
19/11/2016, 18:02 - Mom: omg
19/11/2016, 18:02 - Mom: why pineapple and pen together funny?
19/11/2016, 18:03 - Cindy LEUNG: what this
19/11/2016, 18:02 - Mom: i don't get it
19/11/2016, 18:03 - Cindy LEUNG: watch this
19/11/2016, 18:03 - Cindy LEUNG: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W3sslyiUfg
19/11/2016, 18:04 - Mom: sorry, don't get the funny bit
19/11/2016, 18:04 - Mom: perhaps i'm too stable
19/11/2016, 18:05 - Mom: emotionally
19/11/2016, 18:05 - Mom: i think u shud try cbt rather than take med
19/11/2016, 18:06 - Cindy LEUNG: well i just died
19/11/2016, 18:06 - Mom: what???
19/11/2016, 18:06 - Mom: the pinapple pen?
19/11/2016, 18:07 - Mom: ur threshold for happy is really too low
19/11/2016, 18:09 - Cindy LEUNG: still shaking
19/11/2016, 18:10 - Mom: omg
19/11/2016, 18:10 - Cindy LEUNG: ok seems to have stabilized
19/11/2016, 18:10 - Cindy LEUNG: that was a meme
19/11/2016, 18:10 - Mom: take some deep breath
19/11/2016, 18:11 - Mom: which part did u shake? jaw? face muscle?
19/11/2016, 18:12 - Cindy LEUNG: jaw
19/11/2016, 18:12 - Cindy LEUNG: and then my head fell back
19/11/2016, 18:12 - Cindy LEUNG: and i lied in the chair
19/11/2016, 18:12 - Cindy LEUNG: i think my eyes dropped
19/11/2016, 18:13 - Cindy LEUNG: and then i saw weird shit in my room
19/11/2016, 18:13 - Cindy LEUNG: like extra windows and doors
19/11/2016, 18:13 - Cindy LEUNG: yea
19/11/2016, 18:13 - Cindy LEUNG: i used to be like this when i watched pewdiepie
19/11/2016, 18:13 - Cindy LEUNG: and then gintama
19/11/2016, 18:16 - Cindy LEUNG: is that happy?
19/11/2016, 18:16 - Cindy LEUNG: i thought it was really funnny
19/11/2016, 18:16 - Cindy LEUNG: why u don't find it funny
19/11/2016, 18:16 - Cindy LEUNG: show it to emos and ask her if she find its funny
19/11/2016, 18:21 - Mom: she slept already
19/11/2016, 18:21 - Cindy LEUNG: ok
19/11/2016, 18:21 - Mom: will show her tmr but i don't think she'll find it very funny
19/11/2016, 18:22 - Cindy LEUNG: i think one of issues with diagnosis is that
19/11/2016, 18:22 - Cindy LEUNG: the things i find funny aren't what the things the doctors think are funny
19/11/2016, 18:23 - Mom: i think those dr just stick to the word "laughter" which is a bit different from happy
19/11/2016, 18:23 - Cindy LEUNG: like sometimes i even find Margaret funny when she talks about pensions
19/11/2016, 18:24 - Cindy LEUNG: ok laughter is definitely wrong then
19/11/2016, 18:25 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz most of the time i don't even get the chance to laugh out loud
19/11/2016, 18:25 - Cindy LEUNG: yeah he asked me if it was laughter as well
19/11/2016, 18:25 - Cindy LEUNG: but i said no
19/11/2016, 18:27 - Mom: definitely not laughter
19/11/2016, 18:28 - Mom: but it's difficult to understand why slightly happy/funny feeling still trigger collapse
19/11/2016, 18:28 - Cindy LEUNG: i can't even pinpoint exact emotion
19/11/2016, 18:28 - Cindy LEUNG: i think there's a bit of cuteness involved as well
19/11/2016, 18:29 - Cindy LEUNG: cute as in the asian sense of the word
19/11/2016, 18:29 - Cindy LEUNG: do u find cute things funny
19/11/2016, 18:29 - Cindy LEUNG: like cute peculiar
19/11/2016, 18:29 - Mom: that's why i think it's the neurotransmitter's response which block ur muscle strength
19/11/2016, 18:30 - Cindy LEUNG: hmm yah most likely
19/11/2016, 18:30 - Cindy LEUNG: just gotta identify which one
19/11/2016, 18:30 - Cindy LEUNG: and then take an antagonist
19/11/2016, 18:31 - Cindy LEUNG: good luck with that, that's a whole phd research paper there
19/11/2016, 18:32 - Mom: let me review the limbic system again
19/11/2016, 18:34 - Cindy LEUNG: kay
19/11/2016, 18:34 - Cindy LEUNG: u know what
19/11/2016, 18:34 - Cindy LEUNG: if they find out what chemical is making me collapse
19/11/2016, 18:35 - Cindy LEUNG: then if they increase this chemical in a depressed person, that could probably cure depression?
19/11/2016, 18:35 - Cindy LEUNG: hmmmm
19/11/2016, 18:36 - Mom: i'll try
19/11/2016, 18:37 - Cindy LEUNG: i mean we possibly have a bargaining chip here
19/11/2016, 18:44 - Mom: u look like a businessman or a consultant now
19/11/2016, 18:44 - Cindy LEUNG: its the LSE effect
19/11/2016, 18:44 - Mom: is it good or bad?
19/11/2016, 18:45 - Mom: going to lse
19/11/2016, 18:45 - Cindy LEUNG: yeah because real world is like this, u gotta threaten people to get them to do things for you
19/11/2016, 18:45 - Cindy LEUNG: i swear we are learning how to make credible threats in GV
19/11/2016, 18:45 - Mom: so power is important rite
19/11/2016, 18:45 - Cindy LEUNG: ofc lah
19/11/2016, 18:46 - Mom: govt and econ is a good combo?
19/11/2016, 18:46 - Cindy LEUNG: er
19/11/2016, 18:46 - Cindy LEUNG: plus more foundation maths
19/11/2016, 18:46 - Cindy LEUNG: and a some finance
19/11/2016, 18:46 - Cindy LEUNG: and stats
19/11/2016, 18:47 - Cindy LEUNG: finance is really useful ah
19/11/2016, 18:47 - Cindy LEUNG: u study risk
19/11/2016, 18:47 - Cindy LEUNG: and uncertainty
19/11/2016, 18:47 - Mom: no regret picking it rite
19/11/2016, 18:47 - Cindy LEUNG: omg it feels like they know how i feel about uncertainty
19/11/2016, 18:47 - Cindy LEUNG: fear about the unknown
19/11/2016, 18:48 - Cindy LEUNG: its a very real fear
19/11/2016, 18:48 - Mom: ur experience is special
19/11/2016, 18:48 - Mom: made u truly understand what risk and uncertainty are
19/11/2016, 18:49 - Cindy LEUNG: yah
19/11/2016, 18:49 - Cindy LEUNG: that's why i like math in the end
19/11/2016, 18:49 - Mom: most ppl won't understand it until late in their life
19/11/2016, 18:49 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz u can eliminate risk with that shit
19/11/2016, 18:49 - Mom: hahaha
19/11/2016, 18:49 - Cindy LEUNG: do u think i will pass interview if i say that
19/11/2016, 18:50 - Mom: for what interview?
19/11/2016, 18:50 - Cindy LEUNG: ahahahaha
19/11/2016, 18:50 - Mom: so it doesn't make a difference
19/11/2016, 18:50 - Cindy LEUNG: for risk management
19/11/2016, 18:51 - Cindy LEUNG: lol it all worked out in the end
19/11/2016, 18:51 - Mom: absolutely correct interpretation of risk mgt
19/11/2016, 18:52 - Mom: but i think interviewers might ask for real world examples to support ur understanding of the risk mgt
19/11/2016, 18:52 - Cindy LEUNG: yea i lived in fear for about 1 year
19/11/2016, 18:52 - Cindy LEUNG: ahahaha
19/11/2016, 18:52 - Cindy LEUNG: im just joking, its not even a funny joke.
19/11/2016, 18:53 - Mom: u can't quote ur health condition as example rite
19/11/2016, 18:57 - Cindy LEUNG: yah fair point
19/11/2016, 18:57 - Mom: sleep? slow response
19/11/2016, 18:57 - Cindy LEUNG: im watching a lecture
19/11/2016, 19:01 - Mom: Cataplexy is a phenomena manifested by loss of muscle control, slackening and inability to move. It is not manifested with seizure like phenomena, no tightening, shaking of body or lims, no active motor phenomena so to speak. So since you describe seizure like movements, body bouncing in one of your previous queries that is not part of cataplexy.
19/11/2016, 19:01 - Mom: this comment abt cataplexy is made by a neurologist
19/11/2016, 19:01 - Cindy LEUNG: er technically
19/11/2016, 19:01 - Cindy LEUNG: i have loss of muscle control
19/11/2016, 19:02 - Mom: but u had shaking rite
19/11/2016, 19:02 - Cindy LEUNG: i only notice jaw area shakes
19/11/2016, 19:02 - Cindy LEUNG: the rest of body actually goes slack
19/11/2016, 19:02 - Mom: what abt facial muscle?
19/11/2016, 19:02 - Cindy LEUNG: not sure about the face twitching
19/11/2016, 19:03 - Cindy LEUNG: before it did, not sure about now
19/11/2016, 19:03 - Cindy LEUNG: but the jaw definitely does
19/11/2016, 19:03 - Cindy LEUNG: some movements like jerks
19/11/2016, 19:03 - Cindy LEUNG: are caused because i try to move
19/11/2016, 19:03 - Cindy LEUNG: so if i don't try to go against the weakness, i.e. don't move
19/11/2016, 19:03 - Cindy LEUNG: i think i'll just be weak
19/11/2016, 19:04 - Cindy LEUNG: and collapse
19/11/2016, 19:04 - Mom: u know, u had body shaking at the very first few months at yr13
19/11/2016, 19:04 - Cindy LEUNG: oh yeah
19/11/2016, 19:04 - Cindy LEUNG: i definitely had tremours
19/11/2016, 19:04 - Cindy LEUNG: in the first couple of months
19/11/2016, 19:04 - Cindy LEUNG: its like slowly those go away
19/11/2016, 19:05 - Mom: yea, after having ivig
19/11/2016, 19:05 - Cindy LEUNG: so u saying the tremours might be caused by ivig
19/11/2016, 19:06 - Mom: don't know
19/11/2016, 19:06 - Cindy LEUNG: possible
19/11/2016, 19:06 - Cindy LEUNG: or the TCM lowering my hr
20/11/2016, 03:54 - Mom: Focal seizures without loss of consciousness (simple partial seizures). These seizures don't cause a loss of consciousness. They may alter emotions or change the way things look, smell, feel, taste or sound. They may also result in involuntary jerking of a body part, such as an arm or leg, and spontaneous sensory symptoms such as tingling, dizziness and flashing lights.
20/11/2016, 07:47 - Cindy LEUNG: Hmm mm
20/11/2016, 07:47 - Mom: Wake up la
20/11/2016, 07:47 - Cindy LEUNG: I don't know if I jerk anymore
20/11/2016, 07:53 - Mom: difference is ur upper torso used to weaken on ur right side only and facial twisted only happened at right side
20/11/2016, 07:54 - Cindy LEUNG: But both my arms r weak
20/11/2016, 07:54 - Cindy LEUNG: And I'm not very sure abt the legs
20/11/2016, 07:55 - Mom: my thought is like this:
20/11/2016, 07:55 - Mom: 1. simple focal seizure affecting ur right side
20/11/2016, 07:56 - Mom: 2. overactive sns leading to drop attack later
20/11/2016, 07:56 - Mom: wud this be possible??
20/11/2016, 07:58 - Mom: rmb at the start of the drop attacks in sep14, ur body did have jerking movement until sitting down on the floor
20/11/2016, 08:00 - Cindy LEUNG: But why would I get focal seizures
20/11/2016, 08:00 - Mom: hmm
20/11/2016, 08:01 - Mom: infection?
20/11/2016, 08:03 - Cindy LEUNG: Plus no seizure show up on eeg
20/11/2016, 08:03 - Cindy LEUNG: So they don't think it's seiw
20/11/2016, 08:03 - Cindy LEUNG: Seizure
20/11/2016, 08:04 - Mom: eeg is not reliable
20/11/2016, 08:05 - Mom: most of the time they won't show up on normal eeg
20/11/2016, 08:05 - Mom: but ur right, dr just see data
20/11/2016, 08:15 - Cindy LEUNG: I hv a couple of infections right now
20/11/2016, 08:15 - Cindy LEUNG: One in the side of my finger
20/11/2016, 08:15 - Cindy LEUNG: My eczema-tized ring finger is acting up
20/11/2016, 08:16 - Cindy LEUNG: That patch behind my thigh is also reappearing
20/11/2016, 08:16 - Mom: did u ask the gp for prescription when u went there on friday?
20/11/2016, 08:16 - Cindy LEUNG: Prescription for wat?
20/11/2016, 08:16 - Mom: for ur eczema
20/11/2016, 08:16 - Cindy LEUNG: No why
20/11/2016, 08:16 - Cindy LEUNG: I hv triderm
20/11/2016, 08:17 - Mom: does it help?
20/11/2016, 08:17 - Cindy LEUNG: No
20/11/2016, 08:17 - Cindy LEUNG: Not really
20/11/2016, 08:17 - Cindy LEUNG: Maybe I need to change my bedsheets
20/11/2016, 08:17 - Mom: u might need other anti-biotics for ur skin
20/11/2016, 08:18 - Mom: or else, u'll get srs inflammation
20/11/2016, 08:18 - Mom: how often did u change ur bedsheet?
20/11/2016, 08:18 - Cindy LEUNG: I've changed them once
20/11/2016, 08:18 - Cindy LEUNG: Probably four weeks ago
20/11/2016, 08:19 - Mom: just once ?
20/11/2016, 08:19 - Mom: omg
20/11/2016, 08:19 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea I need to change my bedsheets
20/11/2016, 08:19 - Mom: i think ur histamine level is raising that makes u feel itchy
20/11/2016, 08:19 - Mom: at least once every two weeks
20/11/2016, 08:19 - Mom: better once every week
20/11/2016, 08:19 - Cindy LEUNG: Because my bedsheets r dirty?
20/11/2016, 08:19 - Mom: no
20/11/2016, 08:20 - Cindy LEUNG: I'm sure they r
20/11/2016, 08:20 - Mom: but ur dirty bedsheets help spread germs and infection
20/11/2016, 08:20 - Cindy LEUNG: Sigh
20/11/2016, 08:20 - Mom: cuz u had lots of sweats on the bedsheets
20/11/2016, 08:20 - Cindy LEUNG: More shit to do
20/11/2016, 08:20 - Mom: sign
20/11/2016, 08:21 - Mom: just change bedsheets
20/11/2016, 08:21 - Mom: not that big deal
20/11/2016, 08:21 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea
20/11/2016, 08:21 - Cindy LEUNG: Easy peasy
20/11/2016, 08:21 - Mom: did u wake up at 3 am last night?
20/11/2016, 08:21 - Cindy LEUNG: I woke up at 2
20/11/2016, 08:21 - Cindy LEUNG: And then wash my hair
20/11/2016, 08:21 - Mom: omg
20/11/2016, 08:21 - Cindy LEUNG: Then I slept in the chair
20/11/2016, 08:22 - Cindy LEUNG: And I kept hearing snoring
20/11/2016, 08:22 - Cindy LEUNG: But I can't hear myself snore right?
20/11/2016, 08:22 - Mom: u shudn't wash ur hair at 2 am, it makes u vulnerable to get ocld
20/11/2016, 08:22 - Cindy LEUNG: There's indoor heating
20/11/2016, 08:22 - Mom: cuz the air at mid-night is so cold
20/11/2016, 08:23 - Cindy LEUNG: Probably the only thing which works in urbanest
20/11/2016, 08:23 - Mom: how long u heard that snoring sound?
20/11/2016, 08:23 - Cindy LEUNG: Well
20/11/2016, 08:23 - Cindy LEUNG: I was also listening to music at the same time
20/11/2016, 08:23 - Mom: basically u wudn't wake up in the mid-night if u didn't have to wash ur hair?
20/11/2016, 08:23 - Cindy LEUNG: So I kind of heard the snore occasionally
20/11/2016, 08:24 - Mom: u worn headphones when u were sleeping
20/11/2016, 08:24 - Cindy LEUNG: I guess so, I would hv gotten up if I showered beforehand
20/11/2016, 08:24 - Cindy LEUNG: No I was sleeping in front o mf the laptop
20/11/2016, 08:24 - Mom: it's ur own snoring, i guess
20/11/2016, 08:24 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea I think it's my snoring.
20/11/2016, 08:25 - Mom: u just heard it periodically when u became awoke at the time of snoring
20/11/2016, 08:25 - Cindy LEUNG: Since it seems that I can hear outside stuff when I dream
20/11/2016, 08:26 - Mom: rmb that when ur in rem state, ur in light sleep phase, basically u'll be awaken quite easily
20/11/2016, 08:26 - Cindy LEUNG: Like if I have a rem episode and I can't move
20/11/2016, 08:26 - Cindy LEUNG: I still hear my roommates walking around
20/11/2016, 08:26 - Mom: u just went in and out of ur sleeping cycles during dreaming stage
20/11/2016, 08:27 - Cindy LEUNG: And then after a while my mind creates the images to go with those sound
20/11/2016, 08:27 - Mom: i guess this is normal
20/11/2016, 08:27 - Mom: this is not hallucination, it's ur brain's forming own connection between the reality and ur memories
20/11/2016, 08:27 - Cindy LEUNG: I remember thinking that the snoring sound was really annoying
20/11/2016, 08:28 - Cindy LEUNG: Hahaha
20/11/2016, 08:28 - Mom: sure, u did snore when u were in hk
20/11/2016, 08:28 - Cindy LEUNG: Like really loudly?
20/11/2016, 08:28 - Mom: sometimes
20/11/2016, 08:29 - Cindy LEUNG: Ok then
20/11/2016, 08:30 - Mom: this astonishes me when ur first night time sleep test showed no sleep apnea but then u developed slight apnea
20/11/2016, 08:30 - Mom: perhaps the muscles at ur lower jaw had loosen
20/11/2016, 08:32 - Mom: how long ur eczema show up again?
20/11/2016, 08:32 - Mom: abt a week?
20/11/2016, 08:32 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea
20/11/2016, 08:33 - Mom: ur histamine has definitely increased, but i dunno why they goes up
20/11/2016, 08:38 - Cindy LEUNG: Nvm
20/11/2016, 08:38 - Cindy LEUNG: I finally know what industrial engineering is
20/11/2016, 08:39 - Cindy LEUNG: Its business econ
20/11/2016, 08:39 - Mom: Wat?
20/11/2016, 08:39 - Mom: like finance
20/11/2016, 08:39 - Cindy LEUNG: U rmb that degree which was v popular with intl kids at nu
20/11/2016, 08:39 - Cindy LEUNG: No it's not finance
20/11/2016, 08:39 - Mom: yea
20/11/2016, 08:39 - Cindy LEUNG: U look at firm entry and exit, strategy
20/11/2016, 08:40 - Mom: what's business econ?
20/11/2016, 08:40 - Cindy LEUNG: That sort of stuff
20/11/2016, 08:40 - Mom: what's firm entry and exit?
20/11/2016, 08:40 - Mom: forming company?
20/11/2016, 08:40 - Cindy LEUNG: Like when do u enter the market
20/11/2016, 08:40 - Cindy LEUNG: How much to produce, at what price
20/11/2016, 08:40 - Cindy LEUNG: Business strategy basically
20/11/2016, 08:40 - Mom: oh, this is basically business
20/11/2016, 08:41 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea its a subset of micro
20/11/2016, 08:41 - Cindy LEUNG: So it's not an engine degree
20/11/2016, 08:41 - Mom: i wud rather do a econ deg
20/11/2016, 08:41 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea
20/11/2016, 08:42 - Cindy LEUNG: I think they just do the basic eng course and then it's mostly an econ course with capstone projects
20/11/2016, 08:42 - Mom: so ppl doing IE wud probably aim for Kellogg
20/11/2016, 08:42 - Cindy LEUNG: Def
20/11/2016, 08:42 - Cindy LEUNG: Or else their degree is underpar
20/11/2016, 08:43 - Mom: ie belongs to school of engrg in nu?
20/11/2016, 08:43 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea
20/11/2016, 08:43 - Cindy LEUNG: They call it industrial engineering
20/11/2016, 08:43 - Mom: this is definitely misleading
20/11/2016, 08:43 - Cindy LEUNG: I think so too
20/11/2016, 08:43 - Cindy LEUNG: Its like Qs?
20/11/2016, 08:44 - Mom: Qs? what is it?
20/11/2016, 08:44 - Cindy LEUNG: Quantitative surveyor
20/11/2016, 08:44 - Cindy LEUNG: Aren't those guys basically accountants?
20/11/2016, 08:44 - Mom: oh, QS is different cuz u need engineer background to understand their basic concept
20/11/2016, 08:45 - Cindy LEUNG: Right I see
20/11/2016, 08:45 - Cindy LEUNG: Fair enough
20/11/2016, 08:45 - Mom: sort of accountant, ur rite
20/11/2016, 08:46 - Cindy LEUNG: Then I think four year ie is not really worth it
20/11/2016, 08:47 - Cindy LEUNG: Lse is pretty much equivalent
20/11/2016, 08:47 - Mom: sure la
20/11/2016, 08:48 - Cindy LEUNG: Phew
20/11/2016, 08:51 - Mom: lse deg worth the money, imo
20/11/2016, 08:51 - Cindy LEUNG: I kind of understand why kgv don't expect ppl to go to states now
20/11/2016, 08:51 - Mom: why/
20/11/2016, 08:51 - Cindy LEUNG: Well
20/11/2016, 08:51 - Cindy LEUNG: If u aim for professional degree
20/11/2016, 08:52 - Cindy LEUNG: U stay in hk right
20/11/2016, 08:52 - Cindy LEUNG: That's most cost effective
20/11/2016, 08:52 - Mom: u can also go to uk
20/11/2016, 08:52 - Cindy LEUNG: At most u will go to UK
20/11/2016, 08:52 - Cindy LEUNG: Exactly that's why they promote UK uni
20/11/2016, 08:52 - Mom: rmb that esf is a uk based school
20/11/2016, 08:53 - Cindy LEUNG: It makes no sense to go to us unless u want to take a special degree
20/11/2016, 08:53 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz its more expensive
20/11/2016, 08:53 - Mom: so, helping students to go for uk unis is reasonable
20/11/2016, 08:53 - Cindy LEUNG: And the degree is actually easier
20/11/2016, 08:53 - Mom: yea
20/11/2016, 08:53 - Cindy LEUNG: Like I see a lot of us kids doing masters here
20/11/2016, 08:53 - Mom: and the curriculum is different in us and uk
20/11/2016, 08:53 - Cindy LEUNG: And they struggle in beginning
20/11/2016, 08:53 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea
20/11/2016, 08:54 - Mom: so my plan for u to go to uk for first deg and then to usa for masters is reasonable
20/11/2016, 08:54 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea that is reasonable
20/11/2016, 08:54 - Mom: and this is most cost effective
20/11/2016, 08:55 - Cindy LEUNG: Problem is there's not enough info before applying
20/11/2016, 08:55 - Mom: applying for what?
20/11/2016, 08:55 - Mom: us unis?
20/11/2016, 08:55 - Cindy LEUNG: For uni
20/11/2016, 08:55 - Mom: hmm
20/11/2016, 08:56 - Cindy LEUNG: Like what they call their degrees r a bit misleading
20/11/2016, 08:56 - Mom: i think the fact is we haven't done throughout research only
20/11/2016, 08:56 - Mom: i know ah
20/11/2016, 08:56 - Cindy LEUNG: U'd hv to research like three years ahead
20/11/2016, 08:57 - Mom: it's just u didn't make up ur mind on choosing ur interest subject
20/11/2016, 08:57 - Cindy LEUNG: Well even if I had interest in Politics
20/11/2016, 08:58 - Cindy LEUNG: Its absolutely different from what I'm doing right now
20/11/2016, 08:58 - Mom: the point is i can't force u to accept my choice for ur ca
20/11/2016, 08:59 - Mom: career
20/11/2016, 08:59 - Cindy LEUNG: Lol
20/11/2016, 08:59 - Cindy LEUNG: There's a lot of mismatch going on
20/11/2016, 08:59 - Mom: and u seemed have no idea on what career to do in the future
20/11/2016, 08:59 - Cindy LEUNG: I can tell u that for sure
20/11/2016, 09:00 - Mom: also ur health turned into serious condition which messed up the whole plan
20/11/2016, 09:00 - Mom: if u didn't have health prob, i'm sure u wud go to dual ba now
20/11/2016, 09:01 - Cindy LEUNG: Hurr
20/11/2016, 09:01 - Cindy LEUNG: Then I'll work at McKinsey
20/11/2016, 09:01 - Mom: why hurr
20/11/2016, 09:02 - Mom: this is my original intention
20/11/2016, 09:02 - Mom: mckinsey is very good
20/11/2016, 09:02 - Cindy LEUNG: Its a good program
20/11/2016, 09:02 - Cindy LEUNG: Columbia vs lse
20/11/2016, 09:02 - Mom: if u can go into mckinsey, u def won't have to bother the rest of ur life
20/11/2016, 09:02 - Cindy LEUNG: I think lse is ok and worth the money
20/11/2016, 09:02 - Mom: sure
20/11/2016, 09:02 - Mom: lse is good
20/11/2016, 09:03 - Mom: and in view of ur health condition, this is the best choice, imo
20/11/2016, 09:03 - Cindy LEUNG: I think we made a right choice too now.
20/11/2016, 09:04 - Cindy LEUNG: I only hv regrets for UCSD left
20/11/2016, 09:04 - Cindy LEUNG: Hahaha
20/11/2016, 09:04 - Mom: i do believe i made a right choice for u
20/11/2016, 09:04 - Mom: ucsd is for bio program
20/11/2016, 09:04 - Cindy LEUNG: Lool
20/11/2016, 09:04 - Mom: if ur interested in bio or medical, ucsd is very good
20/11/2016, 09:04 - Cindy LEUNG: They r good engibe school in general
20/11/2016, 09:05 - Mom: if econ, i think lse or nu or columbia wud be better
20/11/2016, 09:05 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea
20/11/2016, 09:05 - Cindy LEUNG: Lse would be most cost effective
20/11/2016, 09:06 - Mom: if u went to ucsd, there's a probability that u wud have ur disorders cleared up earlier ??
20/11/2016, 09:06 - Cindy LEUNG: Hmmm I dunno
20/11/2016, 09:07 - Cindy LEUNG: At least they hv a neuro department to talk to
20/11/2016, 09:07 - Mom: not sure, becos no data for medical money
20/11/2016, 09:07 - Mom: exactly
20/11/2016, 09:07 - Mom: u can submit urself to be a trial
20/11/2016, 09:07 - Cindy LEUNG: Hahaha
20/11/2016, 09:07 - Cindy LEUNG: I Wonder how good Stanford actually is now
20/11/2016, 09:08 - Mom: how wud we know??
20/11/2016, 09:08 - Cindy LEUNG: That's true
20/11/2016, 09:09 - Cindy LEUNG: Ppl who went to Stanford will not trash it
20/11/2016, 09:09 - Mom: i talked to emos abt the pineapple youtube, she said that's funny but that very funny
20/11/2016, 09:09 - Mom: she said she'll laugh for only a couple of seconds

20/11/2016, 09:10 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz its catchy
20/11/2016, 09:10 - Mom: but worth for only few seconds
20/11/2016, 09:10 - Cindy LEUNG: Ok what's very funny then
20/11/2016, 09:11 - Mom: sorry, i don't get the catch line even now
20/11/2016, 09:11 - Mom: i mean the punch line
20/11/2016, 09:11 - Mom: she's the kind of person not having intense emotions all the time
20/11/2016, 09:15 - Cindy LEUNG: Look I'm watching james cordon
20/11/2016, 09:15 - Cindy LEUNG: And he's funny

20/11/2016, 09:18 - Mom: she's working on her maths/chem
20/11/2016, 09:18 - Cindy LEUNG: Cher
20/11/2016, 09:18 - Mom: i forced her to do revision
20/11/2016, 09:19 - Mom: she's the one i have no confidence
20/11/2016, 09:19 - Cindy LEUNG: Tell her to make a PowerPoint
20/11/2016, 09:19 - Mom: evaluation on her is so difficult
20/11/2016, 09:19 - Mom: for what?
20/11/2016, 09:19 - Cindy LEUNG: U want to make notes like that
20/11/2016, 09:20 - Mom: i was thinking if u can give her online tutorial lessons, becoz u got extra time watching funny videos and made urself paralysed and unable to do work
20/11/2016, 09:21 - Mom: it wud be more productive if u can do other works with that duration
20/11/2016, 09:21 - Mom: hahaha
20/11/2016, 09:22 - Cindy LEUNG: Haha haha I'm working on micro at the same time üò∞
20/11/2016, 09:23 - Mom: how wud u do micro and watch funny video and got paralysed and talk on whatsapp
20/11/2016, 09:23 - Cindy LEUNG: Hahaha
20/11/2016, 09:23 - Cindy LEUNG: That is a special skill
20/11/2016, 09:23 - Mom: üòÆüòÆ
20/11/2016, 09:25 - Cindy LEUNG: Plus year 11 is easy
20/11/2016, 09:26 - Cindy LEUNG: Just sit down write everything out, find everything u don't understand, remember the buzzwords, do the past papers, ask teachers questions
20/11/2016, 09:26 - Cindy LEUNG: That's how to get 11 a*
20/11/2016, 10:07 - Cindy LEUNG: Mopps
20/11/2016, 10:07 - Cindy LEUNG: I just had a really vivid dream again
20/11/2016, 10:08 - Cindy LEUNG: Someone's moments before preparing for surgery
20/11/2016, 10:08 - Cindy LEUNG: I was sleeping in my chair
20/11/2016, 10:09 - Cindy LEUNG: a nursemaid kept coming in to do some stretching exercise with the patient
20/11/2016, 10:09 - Cindy LEUNG: and then she would attached a device to his left arm
20/11/2016, 10:10 - Cindy LEUNG: which electrically stimulated his limb muscles
20/11/2016, 10:10 - Cindy LEUNG: and then a bunch of doctors came in for check up
20/11/2016, 10:10 - Cindy LEUNG: all this time i was trying to sleep, like i knew i was trying to sleep
20/11/2016, 10:10 - Cindy LEUNG: everytime i closed my eyes and went to sleep, i saw exactly the same thing playout
20/11/2016, 10:11 - Cindy LEUNG: so i watched it
20/11/2016, 10:11 - Cindy LEUNG: and then a bunch of doctors came in for checkup
20/11/2016, 10:11 - Mom: r u looping?
20/11/2016, 10:11 - Cindy LEUNG: the first one wanted to check his teeth and was planning to remove them
20/11/2016, 10:12 - Cindy LEUNG: no i'm typing this as fast as i can
20/11/2016, 10:12 - Cindy LEUNG: so just connect at the bunch of doctors part
20/11/2016, 10:12 - Cindy LEUNG: and then a second one came in
20/11/2016, 10:12 - Cindy LEUNG: to test the muscles
20/11/2016, 10:12 - Cindy LEUNG: paralyzed
20/11/2016, 10:12 - Cindy LEUNG: a third one came in to check spinal cord
20/11/2016, 10:12 - Cindy LEUNG: and then all these nurses and machines came in
20/11/2016, 10:13 - Cindy LEUNG: and then they fit this head brace on me
20/11/2016, 10:13 - Mom: u r the patient rite
20/11/2016, 10:14 - Cindy LEUNG: and then he said he was gonna do a small incision near the top of my spine
20/11/2016, 10:14 - Cindy LEUNG: yea
20/11/2016, 10:14 - Cindy LEUNG: and then there was this salt like stuff on my arm
20/11/2016, 10:14 - Cindy LEUNG: i looked up and saw reading of my hr and bp
20/11/2016, 10:14 - Mom: top of the spine, that is the cerebrum
20/11/2016, 10:15 - Cindy LEUNG: like there was a white monitor, with black screen and blue digital display
20/11/2016, 10:15 - Cindy LEUNG: and then there was one of those heart pulse patterns
20/11/2016, 10:15 - Cindy LEUNG: and then i think they put tubes into my spine from where he made the incision
20/11/2016, 10:16 - Cindy LEUNG: i can mark out the exactly point
20/11/2016, 10:16 - Cindy LEUNG: of the incision
20/11/2016, 10:16 - Cindy LEUNG: and then i felt them attached and tighten more tubes to the back of my neck
20/11/2016, 10:16 - Mom: wow, this is incredible
20/11/2016, 10:16 - Cindy LEUNG: probably to the headbrace
20/11/2016, 10:16 - Cindy LEUNG: and then
20/11/2016, 10:16 - Cindy LEUNG: i think they connected to the machines
20/11/2016, 10:16 - Cindy LEUNG: and then they left
20/11/2016, 10:16 - Mom: ur dream is so sophisticate that u can recall every detail
20/11/2016, 10:16 - Cindy LEUNG: like i couldn't move
20/11/2016, 10:17 - Cindy LEUNG: and then i felt the stuff flow into my body
20/11/2016, 10:17 - Cindy LEUNG: i started feeling numb in my left foot
20/11/2016, 10:17 - Cindy LEUNG: sorry no top of right foot
20/11/2016, 10:17 - Cindy LEUNG: ah i also remember i was hyperventilating
20/11/2016, 10:17 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz it said on the heart monitor
20/11/2016, 10:18 - Mom: hr?
20/11/2016, 10:18 - Cindy LEUNG: didn't see number
20/11/2016, 10:18 - Mom: go ahead
20/11/2016, 10:18 - Cindy LEUNG: and then when i felt my feet go numb i woke up
20/11/2016, 10:18 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz i remembered it was a dream and i kind of panicked
20/11/2016, 10:19 - Cindy LEUNG: it felt like they were doing some sort of treatment on  me
20/11/2016, 10:19 - Cindy LEUNG: i was sat in my desk chair btw
20/11/2016, 10:19 - Mom: why don't u let them treat u?
20/11/2016, 10:19 - Cindy LEUNG: but i felt like the patient in some sort of chair and then he got strapped to all these machines and tubes
20/11/2016, 10:20 - Mom: is this dream immediate after u watched the funny video and having paralysed episode?
20/11/2016, 10:20 - Cindy LEUNG: no i got sleepy after u stopped talking to me
20/11/2016, 10:21 - Cindy LEUNG: so i tried to take a nap
20/11/2016, 10:21 - Cindy LEUNG: and then every time i tried to sleep
20/11/2016, 10:21 - Cindy LEUNG: there's this fat lady who would come in and then put against my legs
20/11/2016, 10:21 - Mom: it's 5.27 we stopped talking and things happened in 30 mins since then
20/11/2016, 10:22 - Cindy LEUNG: yea
20/11/2016, 10:22 - Cindy LEUNG: im trying to remember what she says
20/11/2016, 10:22 - Mom: u said u tried to sleep, did u actually sleep?
20/11/2016, 10:22 - Cindy LEUNG: yes
20/11/2016, 10:22 - Cindy LEUNG: this is a dream
20/11/2016, 10:22 - Mom: what did she say in the dream?
20/11/2016, 10:23 - Mom: sure, it's a dream but the content is a bit unbelievable
20/11/2016, 10:23 - Cindy LEUNG: i can't remember what she said
20/11/2016, 10:23 - Mom: good thing or bad thing
20/11/2016, 10:23 - Cindy LEUNG: neutral
20/11/2016, 10:24 - Cindy LEUNG: i remember that i didn't trust the doctors
20/11/2016, 10:24 - Mom: and do u feel those drs and nurse unpleasant in ur dream
20/11/2016, 10:24 - Cindy LEUNG: yes
20/11/2016, 10:24 - Cindy LEUNG: but i thought that was just me
20/11/2016, 10:24 - Cindy LEUNG: until they strapped me to a head brace and had weird machines come in
20/11/2016, 10:24 - Cindy LEUNG: then it was a very different story
20/11/2016, 10:26 - Mom: this is like scene happened in clockwork orange?
20/11/2016, 10:26 - Cindy LEUNG: hmm i didn't think of that
20/11/2016, 10:27 - Cindy LEUNG: probably mixed with my hospital experience
20/11/2016, 10:27 - Mom: i think so
20/11/2016, 10:27 - Mom: scare so much?
20/11/2016, 10:27 - Cindy LEUNG: ok great, i was starting to wonder if i was actually see another person's memories
20/11/2016, 10:28 - Cindy LEUNG: hahahaha üò∞
20/11/2016, 10:28 - Mom: ur previous life?
20/11/2016, 10:28 - Mom: no way
20/11/2016, 10:28 - Cindy LEUNG: the medical technology is so advance not previous life
20/11/2016, 10:28 - Mom: actually ur experience in PMH isn't that scary
20/11/2016, 10:29 - Mom: u just stayed there for couple of days doing nothing
20/11/2016, 10:29 - Cindy LEUNG: i mean like so i know what being attached to stuff feels like
20/11/2016, 10:30 - Mom: did those drs try to heal that patient or just treat him as experiment?
20/11/2016, 10:30 - Cindy LEUNG: er.. not sure
20/11/2016, 10:30 - Cindy LEUNG: i think they were trying to heal him
20/11/2016, 10:30 - Cindy LEUNG: but the patient felt like an experiment
20/11/2016, 10:30 - Mom: so u r the patient rite?
20/11/2016, 10:30 - Cindy LEUNG: yes
20/11/2016, 10:31 - Cindy LEUNG: its just the detail
20/11/2016, 10:31 - Cindy LEUNG: is incredible
20/11/2016, 10:31 - Cindy LEUNG: like real VR
20/11/2016, 10:31 - Mom: yea, as i said u can recall so much details which is incredible
20/11/2016, 10:32 - Mom: even if a person waking from rem dream, he can't recall things in such details
20/11/2016, 10:32 - Cindy LEUNG: i think the lady kept coming in to stop me from sleeping
20/11/2016, 10:32 - Cindy LEUNG: so we all know where that came from
20/11/2016, 10:33 - Mom: oh, it's like the scene u took eeg at tst neurologist?
20/11/2016, 10:33 - Mom: that nurse kept telling u not to sleep
20/11/2016, 10:34 - Cindy LEUNG: its more like the scene at ÂØ∂Ë°Ä
20/11/2016, 10:34 - Mom: ok
20/11/2016, 10:35 - Mom: but u didn't have experience abt putting tubes at the top of ur spine?
20/11/2016, 10:35 - Cindy LEUNG: no
20/11/2016, 10:35 - Mom: how can u come up with this scene
20/11/2016, 10:36 - Mom: r u scared now?
20/11/2016, 10:38 - Cindy LEUNG: <Media omitted>
20/11/2016, 10:39 - Mom: the black spot?
20/11/2016, 10:39 - Cindy LEUNG: yes
20/11/2016, 10:39 - Mom: that's not spine
20/11/2016, 10:39 - Cindy LEUNG: i tried to mark as best as possible
20/11/2016, 10:40 - Cindy LEUNG: its next to the spine
20/11/2016, 10:40 - Cindy LEUNG: he can't cut into spine
20/11/2016, 10:40 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz he was gonna feed tubes into it
20/11/2016, 10:40 - Mom: right side?
20/11/2016, 10:40 - Cindy LEUNG: left
20/11/2016, 10:41 - Mom: what fluid was he going to put into?
20/11/2016, 10:41 - Cindy LEUNG: dunno but i saw them mixing it
20/11/2016, 10:41 - Cindy LEUNG: it was in little tubes
20/11/2016, 10:41 - Cindy LEUNG: like a clear liquid
20/11/2016, 10:41 - Mom: little ivig fluid?
20/11/2016, 10:41 - Cindy LEUNG: yes i suppose
20/11/2016, 10:42 - Cindy LEUNG: maybe i just dreamt the ivig thing again
20/11/2016, 10:42 - Mom: looks like a mixture of ur memories
20/11/2016, 10:42 - Mom: except the incision tube part
20/11/2016, 10:43 - Cindy LEUNG: yeah
20/11/2016, 10:43 - Cindy LEUNG: that must be long term memory by now
20/11/2016, 10:43 - Mom: sure
20/11/2016, 10:43 - Mom: is this the first time u had this kind of dream?
20/11/2016, 10:43 - Cindy LEUNG: no like the previous time
20/11/2016, 10:44 - Mom: i mean the content
20/11/2016, 10:44 - Cindy LEUNG: where i was chased and whipped
20/11/2016, 10:44 - Cindy LEUNG: oh yeah i never dream the same dream twice
20/11/2016, 10:44 - Cindy LEUNG: the other time where i was chased and whipped was similar exp
20/11/2016, 10:45 - Cindy LEUNG: ive been wondering is it changing again, cuz the recurrent nightmares have stopped
20/11/2016, 10:46 - Mom: if u actually had emotional difficulty abt a particular event, u shud had repeated dreams underlying that incident
20/11/2016, 10:47 - Cindy LEUNG: u mean something like trauma right?
20/11/2016, 10:47 - Mom: doesn't look like u had real emotional problem
20/11/2016, 10:47 - Cindy LEUNG: no
20/11/2016, 10:47 - Mom: yea
20/11/2016, 10:47 - Cindy LEUNG: it doesn't
20/11/2016, 10:47 - Cindy LEUNG: what is does seem like is that
20/11/2016, 10:48 - Cindy LEUNG: the dreams tend to be associated with significant emotions
20/11/2016, 10:48 - Mom: i mean u don't have a real cause for ur dream
20/11/2016, 10:48 - Cindy LEUNG: yea
20/11/2016, 10:48 - Cindy LEUNG: like sometimes they happen
20/11/2016, 10:48 - Cindy LEUNG: sometimes they dont
20/11/2016, 10:49 - Mom: do u find this dream annoying?
20/11/2016, 10:51 - Cindy LEUNG: no i guess not
20/11/2016, 10:52 - Cindy LEUNG: idk
20/11/2016, 10:52 - Cindy LEUNG: possible factor
20/11/2016, 10:52 - Cindy LEUNG: i was thinking about the ivig incident in teh shower last night
20/11/2016, 10:52 - Mom: if so, this dream came in so late
20/11/2016, 10:53 - Cindy LEUNG: but i guess its not completely out of the blue
20/11/2016, 10:54 - Mom: did u dream last night?
20/11/2016, 10:55 - Cindy LEUNG: don't rmb

20/11/2016, 12:07 - Mom: did it come out very slowly or fast?
20/11/2016, 13:10 - Cindy LEUNG: Normal
20/11/2016, 13:10 - Cindy LEUNG: He did it really quickly
20/11/2016, 13:12 - Cindy LEUNG: Gp had to collect blood himself
20/11/2016, 13:12 - Cindy LEUNG: Sad
20/11/2016, 13:22 - Mom: rmb the time u took blood in PMH, ur blood flow very slowly
20/11/2016, 13:57 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea
20/11/2016, 13:57 - Cindy LEUNG: I think it has to do with technique as well tbh
20/11/2016, 13:57 - Mom: is this case similar to that one?
20/11/2016, 13:58 - Cindy LEUNG: No
20/11/2016, 13:58 - Cindy LEUNG: The blood is like normal
20/11/2016, 13:58 - Cindy LEUNG: It was so fast
20/11/2016, 13:58 - Mom: can u see the colour of ur blood?
20/11/2016, 13:58 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea it's dark red
20/11/2016, 13:58 - Mom: deep red or just freshly red
20/11/2016, 13:58 - Cindy LEUNG: Err can't tell?
20/11/2016, 13:58 - Cindy LEUNG: Dark red?
20/11/2016, 13:59 - Mom: nvm
20/11/2016, 13:59 - Cindy LEUNG: He kind of stuck in the needle
20/11/2016, 13:59 - Cindy LEUNG: And the all the blood ran out
20/11/2016, 14:00 - Cindy LEUNG: And then the tube was filled really quickly
20/11/2016, 14:00 - Mom: wow, totally different from last time
20/11/2016, 15:07 - Cindy LEUNG: <Media omitted>
20/11/2016, 15:15 - Mom: what insight do u have?
20/11/2016, 15:16 - Mom: good businessmen r used to have good mathematical skills like Li Ka Shing
20/11/2016, 15:16 - Cindy LEUNG: I just saw that in my email
20/11/2016, 15:16 - Cindy LEUNG: I think programming helps
20/11/2016, 15:17 - Cindy LEUNG: Makes u think logically
20/11/2016, 15:17 - Cindy LEUNG: And I never dream abt math or econ
20/11/2016, 15:18 - Cindy LEUNG: The most interesting section was cut off:
20/11/2016, 15:18 - Cindy LEUNG: Scientists from the Duke University localized brain regions and found, that both, mathematical tasks and control of emotions activate the same part of our brain. In other words, the higher the person‚Äôs activity during a math task was, the more able s/he could manage emotions.
20/11/2016, 15:19 - Cindy LEUNG: Just now someone asked me for directions and I nearly jumped and screamed when he talked to me.
20/11/2016, 15:19 - Cindy LEUNG: Lol
20/11/2016, 15:37 - Mom: why so scary?
20/11/2016, 15:38 - Mom: i think no one will dream abt maths thingy
20/11/2016, 15:38 - Mom: but it looks like u need to work harder in maths
20/11/2016, 15:39 - Mom: which part in the brain control mathematical concept? temporal?
20/11/2016, 15:54 - Cindy LEUNG: Executive function is frontal cortex no?
20/11/2016, 15:54 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz I was surprised I jumped
20/11/2016, 15:55 - Cindy LEUNG: Last April someone talked to me in the library and I yelled
20/11/2016, 15:55 - Cindy LEUNG: So my stress response is slowly ebbing back to normal I think
20/11/2016, 15:57 - Cindy LEUNG: So this is no coincidence that I had problem with math  when my emotions were most turbulent
20/11/2016, 15:58 - Cindy LEUNG: So do u think it is because my emotions started fluctuating a lot which made it difficult to perform math tasks temporarily?
20/11/2016, 15:59 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz right now it is obvious that I can do math
20/11/2016, 15:59 - Mom: remember the summer 2014 when we moved back to tsing yi, ur emotion was terrible, very easy to get very angry
20/11/2016, 15:59 - Cindy LEUNG: And then I also didn't like Greenfield and my marks kept dropping so intense frustration flow back into a vicious cycle
20/11/2016, 16:00 - Cindy LEUNG: Yah
20/11/2016, 16:01 - Cindy LEUNG: So im guessing it is possible that if emotions r strong enough, they can override executive function in the brain
20/11/2016, 16:01 - Mom: also u had lots of grievance abt Greenfield at yr 12, rmb that?
20/11/2016, 16:01 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea
20/11/2016, 16:01 - Cindy LEUNG: I member
20/11/2016, 16:01 - Cindy LEUNG: Lol Southpark joke
20/11/2016, 16:01 - Mom: yea, those r strong emotions
20/11/2016, 16:02 - Cindy LEUNG: So maybe nothing in particular happened
20/11/2016, 16:02 - Mom: this might be the cause which initiated ur ANS to function not properly
20/11/2016, 16:02 - Cindy LEUNG: But just that I accumulated a lot of angry emotions
20/11/2016, 16:02 - Mom: if this is the cause, ur so "yuen wong"
20/11/2016, 16:03 - Cindy LEUNG: Yah
20/11/2016, 16:03 - Cindy LEUNG: I'm sure a lot of people get angrier than me.
20/11/2016, 16:03 - Mom: but ur emotions r stronger than their
20/11/2016, 16:03 - Mom: theirs
20/11/2016, 16:04 - Cindy LEUNG: Possible cuz I'm young.
20/11/2016, 16:04 - Mom: which hurt urself
20/11/2016, 16:04 - Mom: hahaha
20/11/2016, 16:04 - Mom: ur not that old now?
20/11/2016, 16:04 - Cindy LEUNG: I meant as in old people rarely get very very angry
20/11/2016, 16:05 - Cindy LEUNG: Which explains why some people go crazy and shoot people
20/11/2016, 16:05 - Mom: yea, their emotions tend to be stable
20/11/2016, 16:05 - Mom: will u shoot ppl if u get very angry?
20/11/2016, 16:06 - Cindy LEUNG: No but I play the scene in my head
20/11/2016, 16:06 - Mom: this is ok
20/11/2016, 16:06 - Cindy LEUNG: Like yesterday those people behind me were really annoying
20/11/2016, 16:06 - Cindy LEUNG: Kept talking and giggling in lecture
20/11/2016, 16:06 - Cindy LEUNG: And I wanted to stab them in the face with a knife
20/11/2016, 16:06 - Mom: i wud do that as well, like say some foul words to them
20/11/2016, 16:07 - Cindy LEUNG: And I kept playing that scene in my head
20/11/2016, 16:07 - Mom: why don't turn ur body and tell them to shut up
20/11/2016, 16:07 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz people don't do that in the uk
20/11/2016, 16:07 - Mom: it's better to play a scene in ur mind
20/11/2016, 16:07 - Cindy LEUNG: They just shut up and tolerate
20/11/2016, 16:07 - Mom: but they're annoying woo
20/11/2016, 16:08 - Mom: ooh
20/11/2016, 16:08 - Cindy LEUNG: UK people don't even press the close button in the lift man
20/11/2016, 16:08 - Mom: can u turn ur head to them and "stare at them"
20/11/2016, 16:08 - Cindy LEUNG: Yah I could
20/11/2016, 16:09 - Cindy LEUNG: I mean I could tell me to shut up if I really wanted to
20/11/2016, 16:09 - Mom: pressing close button is different, which doesn't cause any nuisance to other ppl
20/11/2016, 16:09 - Mom: omg
20/11/2016, 16:09 - Mom: if i were u, i wud mostly tell them to shut up in a nice manner
20/11/2016, 16:09 - Cindy LEUNG: Yeah it does it's like a bunch of people standing in the lift waiting for the door to close
20/11/2016, 16:09 - Cindy LEUNG: That's really stupid
20/11/2016, 16:10 - Mom: that is inefficient
20/11/2016, 16:10 - Cindy LEUNG: Its like u want to go to the third floor, but u have to wait for someone else to press the button for third floor
20/11/2016, 16:10 - Mom: they're wasting the world's resource and their lives
20/11/2016, 16:10 - Cindy LEUNG: UK people do dumb things like that
20/11/2016, 16:10 - Mom: why wait for someone? u can't press it?
20/11/2016, 16:11 - Cindy LEUNG: Its like a cultural thing
20/11/2016, 16:11 - Cindy LEUNG: U know, like even if rush hour they don't push onto the tube
20/11/2016, 16:11 - Mom: can't understand why london is a financial centre
20/11/2016, 16:11 - Cindy LEUNG: White privilege
20/11/2016, 16:11 - Mom: err...
20/11/2016, 16:12 - Mom: i think it's just cultural difference
20/11/2016, 16:12 - Cindy LEUNG: Passive aggressiveness is also part of culture difference right
20/11/2016, 16:12 - Mom: so sad
20/11/2016, 16:12 - Cindy LEUNG: Its like they feel pressure to appear nice.
20/11/2016, 16:13 - Cindy LEUNG: I rather talk to the Americans
20/11/2016, 16:13 - Mom: i now understand why uk ppl have so many weird illness
20/11/2016, 16:13 - Cindy LEUNG: U know just say what u think
20/11/2016, 16:13 - Cindy LEUNG: I think trump is shit
20/11/2016, 16:13 - Mom: maybe those r a result of emotional imbalance
20/11/2016, 16:13 - Cindy LEUNG: But Hillary is shittier
20/11/2016, 16:13 - Cindy LEUNG: Something like that
20/11/2016, 16:14 - Mom: uk ppl need to maintain the gentlemen manner
20/11/2016, 16:14 - Cindy LEUNG: yeah!
20/11/2016, 16:14 - Cindy LEUNG: That's it
20/11/2016, 16:14 - Cindy LEUNG: So sometimes u can get away with a lot of stuff
20/11/2016, 16:15 - Cindy LEUNG: Like this person never goes to class

20/11/2016, 17:07 - Cindy LEUNG: Saaah
20/11/2016, 17:07 - Mom: she might have ruined europe's future
20/11/2016, 17:07 - Cindy LEUNG: According to economics

20/11/2016, 17:10 - Mom: u need to trade off the pros and cons of doing a particular thing, this time i think merkel is too generous
20/11/2016, 17:11 - Cindy LEUNG: Idk
20/11/2016, 17:11 - Cindy LEUNG: Would need further analysis
20/11/2016, 17:11 - Cindy LEUNG: Maybe she thinks she could use the extra labor
20/11/2016, 17:12 - Mom: sigh
20/11/2016, 17:12 - Mom: do u think germany is in urgent need of labour?

20/11/2016, 17:14 - Mom: how wud u think they're rich?
20/11/2016, 17:14 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz they own land for one

21/11/2016, 13:45 - Cindy LEUNG: u might want to do so
21/11/2016, 13:45 - Mom: did u sleep after we talked in the mid-night?
21/11/2016, 13:45 - Cindy LEUNG: yes
21/11/2016, 13:45 - Mom: ok, i'll check for it
21/11/2016, 13:45 - Mom: how long u slept?
21/11/2016, 13:45 - Cindy LEUNG: dunno
21/11/2016, 13:45 - Cindy LEUNG: exact
21/11/2016, 13:45 - Cindy LEUNG: but seems like that's not important
21/11/2016, 13:45 - Cindy LEUNG: https://www.coursera.org/learn/medical-neuroscience/home/welcome
21/11/2016, 13:45 - Mom: just estimation
21/11/2016, 13:46 - Cindy LEUNG: maybe like an hr?
21/11/2016, 13:46 - Mom: like 30 mins to 2 hrs is different
21/11/2016, 13:46 - Cindy LEUNG: idk
21/11/2016, 13:46 - Mom: can u function today?
21/11/2016, 13:46 - Cindy LEUNG: yea sort of
21/11/2016, 13:46 - Cindy LEUNG: i understood the gv seminar
21/11/2016, 13:46 - Cindy LEUNG: even though i was sleeping halfway
21/11/2016, 13:50 - Cindy LEUNG: so cones sense red, blue and green
21/11/2016, 13:50 - Cindy LEUNG: uh oh
21/11/2016, 13:50 - Cindy LEUNG: if i see black stuff change green
21/11/2016, 13:50 - Cindy LEUNG: doesn't that mean the red and blue ones are turning off?
21/11/2016, 13:50 - Cindy LEUNG: uh o
21/11/2016, 13:51 - Mom: no
21/11/2016, 13:52 - Mom: if u see green, it means the nerves seeing green turn off
21/11/2016, 13:52 - Cindy LEUNG: er no
21/11/2016, 13:52 - Cindy LEUNG: why
21/11/2016, 13:53 - Mom: i watched a video abt the sight, it said so
21/11/2016, 13:53 - Mom: but i forgot why
21/11/2016, 13:53 - Cindy LEUNG: right
21/11/2016, 13:53 - Mom: i try to find out that video and show u later
21/11/2016, 13:54 - Cindy LEUNG: the cones are sensitive to the different wavelengths of light
21/11/2016, 13:55 - Cindy LEUNG: so if u see green doesn't that mean that the other two lose sensitivity?
21/11/2016, 13:56 - Cindy LEUNG: When light strikes a cone, it interacts with a visual pigment which consists of a protein called opsin and a small molecule called a chromophore which in humans is a derivative of vitamin A. Three different kinds of opsins respond to short, medium and long wavelengths of light and lead to the three response curves shown above. For a person to see an object in color, at least two kinds of cones must be triggered, and the perceived color is based on the relative level of excitation of the different cones.
21/11/2016, 13:57 - Cindy LEUNG: i think the point is
21/11/2016, 13:57 - Cindy LEUNG: are my eyes making me see green or my brain?
21/11/2016, 13:57 - Cindy LEUNG: then there's no point in focusing on the cones
21/11/2016, 13:58 - Mom: it's ur brain telling u the colour rite?
21/11/2016, 13:58 - Cindy LEUNG: if it changes i guess so
21/11/2016, 13:58 - Cindy LEUNG: like the thing is supposed to be black
21/11/2016, 13:58 - Cindy LEUNG: and i know that
21/11/2016, 13:59 - Cindy LEUNG: brb i'm going to pilates
21/11/2016, 13:59 - Mom: k
21/11/2016, 15:22 - Cindy LEUNG: Ok I'm back
21/11/2016, 15:22 - Mom: here
21/11/2016, 16:05 - Mom: what have u found abt the vision and colour?
21/11/2016, 16:07 - Cindy LEUNG: Yep can't work
21/11/2016, 16:07 - Cindy LEUNG: That's all I've discovered
21/11/2016, 16:07 - Cindy LEUNG: I need to go back and sleep
21/11/2016, 16:08 - Mom: ok, sleep now
21/11/2016, 16:08 - Cindy LEUNG: I can't think at all
21/11/2016, 16:08 - Cindy LEUNG: I already napped a lot
21/11/2016, 16:08 - Cindy LEUNG: I'm in a cafe right now
21/11/2016, 16:08 - Mom: haaa
21/11/2016, 16:08 - Cindy LEUNG: No matter how much I nap, I can't think straight
21/11/2016, 16:09 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz I hv econ later
21/11/2016, 16:09 - Mom: did u feel refresh after nap?
21/11/2016, 16:09 - Cindy LEUNG: A bit
21/11/2016, 16:09 - Cindy LEUNG: Like not as tired
21/11/2016, 16:09 - Cindy LEUNG: But not that my head is cle
21/11/2016, 16:09 - Cindy LEUNG: Clear
21/11/2016, 16:09 - Mom: brain fog?
21/11/2016, 16:10 - Mom: does the pilates help relax ur brain?
21/11/2016, 16:10 - Cindy LEUNG: No
21/11/2016, 16:10 - Cindy LEUNG: It strengthens ir muscles dude
21/11/2016, 16:10 - Cindy LEUNG: Its bodyweight training
21/11/2016, 16:10 - Mom: okok
21/11/2016, 16:10 - Cindy LEUNG: I mention that many times alret
21/11/2016, 16:11 - Cindy LEUNG: Already
21/11/2016, 16:11 - Mom: ai ya, i used to mess it up with yoga
21/11/2016, 16:13 - Cindy LEUNG: I can do simple reading right now
21/11/2016, 16:13 - Cindy LEUNG: Not derivations of cost functions
21/11/2016, 16:13 - Mom: i remember that when i watched that video it said our brain process lights coming through our eyes like that we see reflection from the sunlight
21/11/2016, 16:14 - Cindy LEUNG: I think it just has to do with melatonin
21/11/2016, 16:14 - Mom: so when u see green text, it means ur brain is not functioning for those green light wave, so u see green colour
21/11/2016, 16:14 - Mom: what melatonin?
21/11/2016, 16:14 - Cindy LEUNG: ....
21/11/2016, 16:14 - Mom: u need melatonin?
21/11/2016, 16:14 - Cindy LEUNG: Like I sleep with light on
21/11/2016, 16:15 - Cindy LEUNG: I stop producing melatonin
21/11/2016, 16:15 - Mom: that affect ur secretion of melatonin, so ur sleep quality was affected
21/11/2016, 16:16 - Mom: so it's better to keep min lights in ur room when u sleep
21/11/2016, 16:16 - Cindy LEUNG: I'm wondering if I should just use red bulbs
21/11/2016, 16:16 - Mom: when ur sleeping?
21/11/2016, 16:17 - Cindy LEUNG: Then I'll be sleeping in a dark room
21/11/2016, 16:17 - Cindy LEUNG: As in the photography dark room
21/11/2016, 16:17 - Mom: if u change all to red light bulbs, then it's weird for reading
21/11/2016, 16:17 - Cindy LEUNG: I mean for sleeping
21/11/2016, 16:17 - Mom: u can try
21/11/2016, 16:18 - Mom: but where can u buy red light bulb?
21/11/2016, 16:18 - Cindy LEUNG: U can buy anything on Amazon
21/11/2016, 16:19 - Mom: i forgot amazon
21/11/2016, 16:19 - Cindy LEUNG: i don't think my eye has problem btw
21/11/2016, 16:20 - Cindy LEUNG: it doesn't seem like the cones just 'turn on' and off
21/11/2016, 16:20 - Cindy LEUNG: they don't work independently either
21/11/2016, 16:20 - Cindy LEUNG: so it has to be the brain
21/11/2016, 16:20 - Mom: it's not ur eyes, i'm afraid it's the nerves
21/11/2016, 16:20 - Cindy LEUNG: what nerves
21/11/2016, 16:20 - Mom: optical nerves
21/11/2016, 16:20 - Cindy LEUNG: u mean
21/11/2016, 16:21 - Cindy LEUNG: in terms of transmitting information to the brain
21/11/2016, 16:21 - Cindy LEUNG: ?
21/11/2016, 16:21 - Mom: yea
21/11/2016, 16:21 - Cindy LEUNG: hmmm
21/11/2016, 16:21 - Cindy LEUNG: i don't think so, but i don't know why yet
21/11/2016, 16:22 - Cindy LEUNG: if my optic nerves (that is the nerves connecting the eyes to the brain) has problems
21/11/2016, 16:22 - Mom: but think twice, seems unreasonable becoz if optical nerves has problem, they won't just appear when ur tired?
21/11/2016, 16:22 - Cindy LEUNG: then i should have permanent vision alteration?
21/11/2016, 16:22 - Cindy LEUNG: yea
21/11/2016, 16:22 - Cindy LEUNG: so its brain
21/11/2016, 16:22 - Cindy LEUNG: right?
21/11/2016, 16:23 - Mom: but why does the colour change happen only when ur tired?
21/11/2016, 16:23 - Cindy LEUNG: time to look at the visual cortex
21/11/2016, 16:24 - Cindy LEUNG: but i do think the 'green' has something to do with sleeping with the lights on
21/11/2016, 16:24 - Mom: maybe
21/11/2016, 16:24 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz i only began to see green a lot here
21/11/2016, 16:24 - Cindy LEUNG: i didn't have that problem over summer at all
21/11/2016, 16:25 - Mom: exactly
21/11/2016, 20:19 - Cindy LEUNG: ok i went back and slept
21/11/2016, 20:19 - Cindy LEUNG: i really needed to sleep i think
21/11/2016, 20:20 - Mom: I think so
21/11/2016, 20:20 - Cindy LEUNG: i finished sleeping already
21/11/2016, 20:20 - Cindy LEUNG: like half an hr ago

21/11/2016, 20:23 - Mom: The fact is u had overcooked it

21/11/2016, 20:28 - Cindy LEUNG: we're already screwed
21/11/2016, 20:29 - Cindy LEUNG: so it just means u will filter out all the poor people

21/11/2016, 20:32 - Mom: Hahaha
21/11/2016, 20:32 - Cindy LEUNG: how can a government fuck its people over so badly and still remain legitimate

21/11/2016, 20:32 - Mom: Hmm
21/11/2016, 20:33 - Cindy LEUNG: but i guess a lot of those are gonna be immigrants as well

21/11/2016, 20:34 - Cindy LEUNG: yea
21/11/2016, 20:34 - Cindy LEUNG: so they'd be like, satisfied with lower quality of living
21/11/2016, 20:34 - Mom: What abt the homeless ppl?
21/11/2016, 20:34 - Cindy LEUNG: i seriously don't know why there are so many homeless people
21/11/2016, 20:35 - Mom: R they whites or others

21/11/2016, 20:42 - Mom: They r mostly unskilled labors or their skills dont match today's tech, so they have difficulties finding jobs
21/11/2016, 20:42 - Cindy LEUNG: he looked like he was getting ready for bed,
21/11/2016, 20:42 - Cindy LEUNG: i swear he wasn't a homeless person

23/11/2016, 03:29 - Cindy LEUNG: And then weirdly, this all happened after menstruation

23/11/2016, 03:29 - Mom: i mean if ur eczema made u unable to sleep at mid-night
23/11/2016, 03:29 - Cindy LEUNG: No it's not
23/11/2016, 03:30 - Mom: hormonal impact
23/11/2016, 03:30 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea I think it's my female hormone
23/11/2016, 03:30 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz
23/11/2016, 03:30 - Cindy LEUNG: My vaginal area is like really itchy as well
23/11/2016, 03:31 - Mom: get some vaginal wash
23/11/2016, 03:31 - Cindy LEUNG: And that happened with the flare up
23/11/2016, 03:31 - Mom: def hormone
23/11/2016, 03:32 - Cindy LEUNG: I don't think it's infection cuz it doesn't smell weird and the discharge is normal colour
23/11/2016, 03:32 - Cindy LEUNG: But I don't usually hv this with flareup
23/11/2016, 03:32 - Mom: then no need to take ant-inflammatory med
23/11/2016, 03:32 - Mom: just keep that area clean, that's ok
23/11/2016, 03:33 - Mom: try stop using that pantyliner, they sometimes cause inflammation
23/11/2016, 03:33 - Mom: hormonal changes ma
23/11/2016, 03:33 - Cindy LEUNG: It is, but it's really itchy
23/11/2016, 03:33 - Mom: did u grow taller?

23/11/2016, 03:34 - Cindy LEUNG: I just know I'm 75kg now cuz I weighted at doctor
23/11/2016, 03:34 - Mom: put some 974 ointment there, can stop the itchy
23/11/2016, 03:34 - Mom: cause they're like eczema
23/11/2016, 03:35 - Mom: don't put triderm or other steriod there, they kill the skin there
23/11/2016, 03:35 - Cindy LEUNG: Second puberty is tough
23/11/2016, 03:35 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea alright
23/11/2016, 03:36 - Mom: perhaps everything returns to normal after ur second puberty
23/11/2016, 03:36 - Cindy LEUNG: Its been itching since the past week üò≠
23/11/2016, 03:36 - Mom: hahaha

23/11/2016, 03:39 - Mom: üëçüèªüëçüèª
23/11/2016, 03:40 - Cindy LEUNG: One other bad thing
23/11/2016, 03:40 - Cindy LEUNG: I think my vision got worse
23/11/2016, 03:41 - Mom: how?
23/11/2016, 03:41 - Mom: double vision or can't see clearly at distance
23/11/2016, 03:41 - Cindy LEUNG: Like I can't even read the board if I stand at the back of the room
23/11/2016, 03:42 - Cindy LEUNG: I stopped wearing contacts for a long time so I don't think it's that
23/11/2016, 03:42 - Cindy LEUNG: I think my vision only change in these couple of weeks
23/11/2016, 03:42 - Mom: 3 possible reasons:
23/11/2016, 03:43 - Mom: 1.  that green thingy did have impact on the eye nerves
23/11/2016, 03:43 - Mom: 2.  sleep deprived
23/11/2016, 03:43 - Cindy LEUNG: But it's like myopia
23/11/2016, 03:43 - Mom: 3.  eye muscles impact
23/11/2016, 03:44 - Mom: 4.  short-sightness worsen
23/11/2016, 03:44 - Mom: srs?
23/11/2016, 03:44 - Cindy LEUNG: Its not like I see black spots or weird images
23/11/2016, 03:44 - Cindy LEUNG: Its just like the myopia worseb
23/11/2016, 03:44 - Mom: just can't see clearly at distance rite?
23/11/2016, 03:45 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea like I need stronger glasses
23/11/2016, 03:45 - Mom: it's possible becoz ur eye balls r still changing
23/11/2016, 03:45 - Mom: omg
23/11/2016, 03:45 - Cindy LEUNG: But my prescription has changed that much in a loooong time
23/11/2016, 03:45 - Cindy LEUNG: Hasn't
23/11/2016, 03:45 - Mom: dunno why?
23/11/2016, 03:45 - Mom: but there's a possiblitiy
23/11/2016, 03:46 - Mom: becoz ur still under puberty and having growth
23/11/2016, 03:46 - Mom: and ur still reading uni
23/11/2016, 03:46 - Cindy LEUNG: Also I think my butt got bigger, cuz my underwear is tight... üòë
23/11/2016, 03:46 - Mom: omg
23/11/2016, 03:47 - Mom: have u done any eye muscles relaxing exercise every time after 30 mins reading
23/11/2016, 03:47 - Cindy LEUNG: I can't even read for 30 mins
23/11/2016, 03:47 - Cindy LEUNG: Dw
23/11/2016, 03:47 - Mom: still, u shud do exercise relaxing ur eye muscles
23/11/2016, 03:47 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea I do
23/11/2016, 03:48 - Cindy LEUNG: Its called taking a nap
23/11/2016, 03:48 - Mom: this is different
23/11/2016, 03:48 - Mom: u need to see distance objects for relaxing eye muscles
23/11/2016, 03:49 - Cindy LEUNG: Omg my eyes r getting worse though üòñ
23/11/2016, 03:49 - Mom: anyway, ur hormonal effect becomes more obvious after this menstruation rite
23/11/2016, 03:49 - Cindy LEUNG: Yes
23/11/2016, 03:49 - Mom: does ur body return to normal now?
23/11/2016, 03:49 - Cindy LEUNG: No
23/11/2016, 03:50 - Cindy LEUNG: Its like worse this week
23/11/2016, 03:50 - Mom: what worsen?
23/11/2016, 03:50 - Cindy LEUNG: It feel like I'm over sensitive to a hormone
23/11/2016, 03:50 - Cindy LEUNG: The allergy response
23/11/2016, 03:51 - Mom: ur hormone comes out differently, maybe more which makes ur symptoms obvious
23/11/2016, 03:51 - Cindy LEUNG: Its only Wednesday and I'm going mad already
23/11/2016, 03:51 - Mom: anyway, just wait and see what happen next cycle
23/11/2016, 03:51 - Mom: how mad?
23/11/2016, 03:51 - Cindy LEUNG: Like this constant itch
23/11/2016, 03:52 - Cindy LEUNG: Is driving me nuts
23/11/2016, 03:52 - Mom: as i told u before, ur histamine level has gone up
23/11/2016, 03:53 - Mom: which makes u itchy
23/11/2016, 03:53 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea u betcha
23/11/2016, 03:53 - Cindy LEUNG: Better not drink or else I will go inamsane
23/11/2016, 03:54 - Mom: don't drink then
23/11/2016, 03:54 - Cindy LEUNG: Ah
23/11/2016, 03:54 - Cindy LEUNG: Should I take some antihistamine
23/11/2016, 03:54 - Mom: useless and it makes u sleep more
23/11/2016, 03:55 - Cindy LEUNG: üò≠
23/11/2016, 03:55 - Cindy LEUNG: Better than nothing I'll try that
23/11/2016, 03:56 - Mom: u know, histamine and orexin both keep person awake
23/11/2016, 03:56 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea I'm wide awake right now
23/11/2016, 03:56 - Cindy LEUNG: And really itchy
23/11/2016, 03:56 - Cindy LEUNG: And kind of hot
23/11/2016, 03:57 - Cindy LEUNG: Maybe the hormone peak right now
23/11/2016, 03:57 - Cindy LEUNG: We thought it was cortisol
23/11/2016, 03:57 - Mom: so, i think ur insomnia during ur middle skl is caused by increased level of histamine
23/11/2016, 03:57 - Cindy LEUNG: But maybe we got the wrong one
23/11/2016, 03:57 - Mom: i think so
23/11/2016, 03:57 - Mom: cortisol
23/11/2016, 03:57 - Cindy LEUNG: No it's some sex hormone
23/11/2016, 03:57 - Mom: ur cortisol level max at the wrong time
23/11/2016, 03:57 - Mom: too early
23/11/2016, 03:58 - Cindy LEUNG: Cortisol doesnt make u itch like mad and hot
23/11/2016, 03:58 - Cindy LEUNG: Which is what I'm feeling right now
23/11/2016, 03:58 - Mom: cortisol max before dawn to prepare u for the day
23/11/2016, 03:59 - Mom: ur itchy feeling is caused by histamine
23/11/2016, 03:59 - Cindy LEUNG: Ye but WHY
23/11/2016, 03:59 - Mom: and hot is caused by female hormone, i guess
23/11/2016, 03:59 - Cindy LEUNG: Histamine is not always high
23/11/2016, 04:00 - Cindy LEUNG: I'm saying the female hormone cause the histamine
23/11/2016, 04:00 - Cindy LEUNG: Which appears to make more sense
23/11/2016, 04:00 - Mom: hmm
23/11/2016, 04:01 - Mom: it's ur brain's decision to enact all these things, but i can't figure out why
23/11/2016, 04:01 - Mom: why ur brain acts like this? any triggering events?
23/11/2016, 04:01 - Cindy LEUNG: Perhaps one of them is speaking at wrong time
23/11/2016, 04:02 - Cindy LEUNG: Or maybe I'm just sensitive to it
23/11/2016, 04:02 - Mom: possible
23/11/2016, 04:02 - Mom: how sensitive now?
23/11/2016, 04:02 - Cindy LEUNG: Like itching like mad
23/11/2016, 04:03 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz the gp ask me how I used to sleep when I was normal and I really can't even remember that
23/11/2016, 04:04 - Mom: how did u answer this question
23/11/2016, 04:04 - Cindy LEUNG: I literally said I can't rmb
23/11/2016, 04:04 - Mom: omg
23/11/2016, 04:05 - Cindy LEUNG: But we were talking abt insomnia
23/11/2016, 04:05 - Mom: ok
23/11/2016, 04:05 - Cindy LEUNG: Also I seem to be really oily as well
23/11/2016, 04:06 - Cindy LEUNG: And dry in some parts
23/11/2016, 04:06 - Mom: this is hormonal changes
23/11/2016, 04:06 - Cindy LEUNG: What is this
23/11/2016, 04:06 - Mom: combination skin
23/11/2016, 04:07 - Cindy LEUNG: Right
23/11/2016, 04:07 - Mom: cause ur sweating glands don't evenly spread over the body
23/11/2016, 04:07 - Cindy LEUNG: Probably
23/11/2016, 04:07 - Cindy LEUNG: I sweat a lot in the morning
23/11/2016, 04:07 - Mom: i wud say, this is obvious evidence of hormonal changes
23/11/2016, 04:07 - Cindy LEUNG: Must take shower everyday
23/11/2016, 04:08 - Mom: hormone again
23/11/2016, 04:08 - Cindy LEUNG: Skin on my face is top notch though
23/11/2016, 04:08 - Mom: good ah
23/11/2016, 04:08 - Cindy LEUNG: Sometimes I does get slightly worse
23/11/2016, 04:09 - Cindy LEUNG: And I slap on a lot of serum and it goes fine after a few days
23/11/2016, 04:09 - Cindy LEUNG: Rest of body is like in haywire
23/11/2016, 04:10 - Cindy LEUNG: I should see if I grew taller
23/11/2016, 04:10 - Cindy LEUNG: Maybe from the pilates
23/11/2016, 04:11 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz my posture is better
23/11/2016, 04:11 - Mom: in fact, no need to put so much serum at ur age
23/11/2016, 04:11 - Mom: i'm afraid it's like doing plastic surgery
23/11/2016, 04:11 - Cindy LEUNG: No how
23/11/2016, 04:12 - Mom: once u did plastic surgery, u can't stop in ur life
23/11/2016, 04:12 - Cindy LEUNG: Its really itchy downstairs thats the problem
23/11/2016, 04:12 - Cindy LEUNG: Well serum is not intrusive so who gives
23/11/2016, 04:12 - Mom: go to gp and ask for solution?
23/11/2016, 04:13 - Cindy LEUNG: And it's just like different kind of cream
23/11/2016, 04:13 - Mom: okok
23/11/2016, 04:13 - Cindy LEUNG: Gp don't give out meds
23/11/2016, 04:13 - Cindy LEUNG: Better go to boots or something tmr
23/11/2016, 04:13 - Mom: but she/he shud tell u how to solve ur problem ?
23/11/2016, 04:14 - Mom: at least he will give out prescriptions?
23/11/2016, 04:14 - Cindy LEUNG: No
23/11/2016, 04:14 - Mom: sigh....
23/11/2016, 04:14 - Cindy LEUNG: They just tell u what to get at boot
23/11/2016, 04:15 - Cindy LEUNG: Like u don't get a prescription for panadol
23/11/2016, 04:15 - Cindy LEUNG: They just say go take some panadol
23/11/2016, 04:15 - Cindy LEUNG: And u say ok
23/11/2016, 04:16 - Mom: but u can't tell if there's infection rite
23/11/2016, 04:16 - Cindy LEUNG: And then if u ask more questions, they give u a hand out
23/11/2016, 04:16 - Cindy LEUNG: There's no smell and discharge is normal colour
23/11/2016, 04:16 - Mom: üòûüòû
23/11/2016, 04:16 - Mom: ok la
23/11/2016, 04:16 - Cindy LEUNG: So it's normal right
23/11/2016, 04:16 - Mom: go get some genital wash
23/11/2016, 04:17 - Cindy LEUNG: Just really fucking itchy for some reason
23/11/2016, 04:17 - Mom: no bad smell and normal discharge look normal
23/11/2016, 04:17 - Mom: becoz of ur emotion
23/11/2016, 04:17 - Cindy LEUNG: I never had histamine affect downstairs as well
23/11/2016, 04:18 - Mom: those r effects of ur female hormonal changes, rather than histamine
23/11/2016, 04:18 - Cindy LEUNG: But my point is u see clear association of hormonal change and histamine this time.
23/11/2016, 04:19 - Mom: i mean ur eczema flareup is a most possible effect of histamine
23/11/2016, 04:20 - Mom: and that "hot" feeling and "extra sweating" r probably caused by changes in female hormone
23/11/2016, 04:20 - Cindy LEUNG: How long does puberty last? Cry.
23/11/2016, 04:20 - Mom: and the why these two or more hormones change at this point of time, i don't know
23/11/2016, 04:21 - Mom: couple of years
23/11/2016, 04:21 - Cindy LEUNG: I never heard of a girl hv puberty so late
23/11/2016, 04:21 - Mom: before 25
23/11/2016, 04:21 - Mom: that's ur second puberty rite
23/11/2016, 04:21 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea I just made it up
23/11/2016, 04:22 - Cindy LEUNG: üò≠üò≠üò≠
23/11/2016, 04:22 - Mom: the female hormonal change is obvious as ur approaching to be a female adult, not like the period when girl turns into teens
23/11/2016, 04:23 - Cindy LEUNG: Well they never teach u the second stage in science
23/11/2016, 04:23 - Mom: err..
23/11/2016, 04:24 - Mom: skl won't teach u everything
23/11/2016, 04:24 - Cindy LEUNG: No wonder those American uni kids go crazy during freshman and sophomore
23/11/2016, 04:24 - Cindy LEUNG: Its true!
23/11/2016, 04:24 - Mom: hahaha
23/11/2016, 04:25 - Mom: this is really insightful
23/11/2016, 04:25 - Cindy LEUNG: Should take a gap year
23/11/2016, 04:25 - Mom: omg
23/11/2016, 04:25 - Cindy LEUNG: Reason, raging hormones
23/11/2016, 04:25 - Mom: hahaha
23/11/2016, 04:25 - Mom: very true
23/11/2016, 04:26 - Cindy LEUNG: Hahahaha
23/11/2016, 04:26 - Cindy LEUNG: Tbh stress and raging hormones is not good
23/11/2016, 04:26 - Mom: for girls
23/11/2016, 04:26 - Cindy LEUNG: Actually very bad
23/11/2016, 04:26 - Cindy LEUNG: Things may go wrong
23/11/2016, 04:27 - Mom: that's why boss don't like to employ pregnant woman
23/11/2016, 04:27 - Mom: they have a reason
23/11/2016, 04:27 - Cindy LEUNG: That's true
23/11/2016, 04:27 - Cindy LEUNG: But can't be helped
23/11/2016, 04:28 - Mom: sure
23/11/2016, 04:28 - Cindy LEUNG: Without pregnant lady. U hv nobody to hire
23/11/2016, 04:28 - Mom: but our doctors r not always wise enough to figure out this disorder before things went wrong
23/11/2016, 04:29 - Mom: without pregnant lady, u can hire immigrants
23/11/2016, 04:29 - Cindy LEUNG: Lol
23/11/2016, 04:29 - Cindy LEUNG: Because immigrants explode from rocks
23/11/2016, 04:30 - Mom: no, just becos immigrants give birth lots of children
23/11/2016, 04:30 - Cindy LEUNG: Ok fair enough
23/11/2016, 04:31 - Cindy LEUNG: I watched a documentary abt refugees
23/11/2016, 04:31 - Mom: poor "expels" the good
23/11/2016, 04:31 - Cindy LEUNG: I think the whole world is fleeing atm
23/11/2016, 04:31 - Cindy LEUNG: Not good
23/11/2016, 04:31 - Mom: i have that feeling
23/11/2016, 04:32 - Mom: but don't know why
23/11/2016, 04:32 - Cindy LEUNG: U got half the world population trying to go to certain places
23/11/2016, 04:32 - Mom: looks like everybody from the middle east and china is trying to flee to europe and america
23/11/2016, 04:32 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea
23/11/2016, 04:33 - Cindy LEUNG: U forgot Africa

23/11/2016, 04:34 - Cindy LEUNG: Y es s
23/11/2016, 04:34 - Mom: something bad seems to happen in us and europe
23/11/2016, 04:35 - Cindy LEUNG: Yupp

23/11/2016, 04:35 - Mom: rest la
23/11/2016, 04:36 - Mom: i'm having neck pain this morning
23/11/2016, 04:36 - Mom: really annoying
23/11/2016, 04:36 - Cindy LEUNG: Damn
23/11/2016, 04:36 - Cindy LEUNG: Use muscle gel
23/11/2016, 04:39 - Mom: k
23/11/2016, 12:47 - Cindy LEUNG: It is now noon
23/11/2016, 12:47 - Cindy LEUNG: I only itch at night
23/11/2016, 12:48 - Cindy LEUNG: Its worst from 3:30-4
23/11/2016, 12:48 - Cindy LEUNG: Now I'm just sweating like mad
23/11/2016, 12:49 - Cindy LEUNG: Its 8 degrees, people had gloves and scarves on. I've got the gap coat on and still really hot.
23/11/2016, 12:49 - Cindy LEUNG: Oh
23/11/2016, 12:49 - Cindy LEUNG: I rmb
23/11/2016, 12:49 - Cindy LEUNG: I had bkf
23/11/2016, 12:49 - Cindy LEUNG: Scrambled eggs with tomato
23/11/2016, 12:49 - Cindy LEUNG: And then abt half an hr later
23/11/2016, 12:50 - Cindy LEUNG: I remember hearing stuff first, at that point I am fully conscious. Like I know those sounds r not real, they seem like background noise
23/11/2016, 12:51 - Cindy LEUNG: And then I close my eyes and go to sleep
23/11/2016, 12:51 - Cindy LEUNG: I can control my dream
23/11/2016, 12:51 - Cindy LEUNG: Not fully
23/11/2016, 12:52 - Cindy LEUNG: Its like I think of something I want to dream about, briefly visual how it looks like and then the brain fill in rest of details
23/11/2016, 12:52 - Cindy LEUNG: And then story was out of my control
23/11/2016, 12:53 - Cindy LEUNG: I realise it's that dream content tends to be strange and scary rather than nice
23/11/2016, 12:54 - Cindy LEUNG: So I think frequent nightmare should be quite normal actually
23/11/2016, 12:54 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz I remember them
23/11/2016, 12:54 - Cindy LEUNG: Normal people just forget before they even wake up
23/11/2016, 13:11 - Mom: Err
23/11/2016, 13:11 - Mom: Not quite understand ah
23/11/2016, 13:11 - Mom: Do u mean u had nightmare again
23/11/2016, 14:30 - Cindy LEUNG: Its not really a nightmare
23/11/2016, 14:30 - Cindy LEUNG: But the stuff r just not nice looking
23/11/2016, 14:30 - Cindy LEUNG: And I just crashed
23/11/2016, 14:31 - Cindy LEUNG: After eating a riceball
23/11/2016, 14:36 - Mom: What crashed?
23/11/2016, 14:36 - Cindy LEUNG: Like went to sleep
23/11/2016, 14:36 - Mom: Collapse?
23/11/2016, 14:36 - Cindy LEUNG: I was sleepy for like an hr
23/11/2016, 14:36 - Cindy LEUNG: But no dream
23/11/2016, 14:37 - Cindy LEUNG: I wonder if it's the protein heavy stuff which cause those seizure like experience or just the bkf meal
23/11/2016, 14:38 - Cindy LEUNG: Anyways I slept so much
23/11/2016, 14:38 - Cindy LEUNG: I went to bed at 2330 and woke up at 0800 today
23/11/2016, 14:40 - Mom: but u woke at 2:30 - 4:00 rite
23/11/2016, 14:41 - Mom: u had seizure after eating riceball?
23/11/2016, 15:03 - Cindy LEUNG: No
23/11/2016, 15:03 - Cindy LEUNG: I woke at 3:30
23/11/2016, 15:03 - Cindy LEUNG: And I went back to sleep at abt 4:30
23/11/2016, 15:03 - Cindy LEUNG: I had seizure like experience after eating the egg
23/11/2016, 15:04 - Cindy LEUNG: I just felt really sleepy, I couldn't concentrate and text kept distorting after the rice ball
23/11/2016, 15:04 - Cindy LEUNG: So I deliberately when t to sleep
23/11/2016, 15:05 - Cindy LEUNG: With the rice ball I would say it was more like brain fog
23/11/2016, 15:08 - Mom: is that protein related?
23/11/2016, 15:09 - Cindy LEUNG: Dunno
23/11/2016, 15:09 - Mom: how long u've been eating protein meal?
23/11/2016, 15:09 - Cindy LEUNG: Long time lah
23/11/2016, 15:09 - Cindy LEUNG: Like three weeks
23/11/2016, 15:09 - Mom: hmm
23/11/2016, 15:10 - Mom: how much protein u eat everyday?
23/11/2016, 15:27 - Cindy LEUNG: Like just eggs
23/11/2016, 15:27 - Cindy LEUNG: I don't even eat that much meat
23/11/2016, 15:28 - Cindy LEUNG: so i was wondering it
23/11/2016, 15:28 - Cindy LEUNG: if
23/11/2016, 15:28 - Cindy LEUNG: eating --> causes sleeping
23/11/2016, 15:29 - Cindy LEUNG: but type of food --> determines time go to sleep afterwards, the kind of sleep i go into and the way i go into sleep state
23/11/2016, 15:38 - Mom: Eating causes sleep, does this make sense?
23/11/2016, 15:38 - Cindy LEUNG: yes
23/11/2016, 15:38 - Cindy LEUNG: why not
23/11/2016, 15:38 - Cindy LEUNG: i mean its not really a matter of what make sense now right?
23/11/2016, 15:40 - Cindy LEUNG: I hv one more rice ball
23/11/2016, 15:40 - Cindy LEUNG: I would try again but I have to write this essay in 6 hr s
23/11/2016, 15:43 - Mom: try it the other day
23/11/2016, 15:43 - Cindy LEUNG: Alriggt
24/11/2016, 01:45 - Cindy LEUNG: I'm more and more convinced that first block of sleep is post dinner sleep
24/11/2016, 01:45 - Mom: ü§î
24/11/2016, 01:45 - Mom: Beciz u eat dinner late
24/11/2016, 01:45 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz I just slept from 11:30-0130
24/11/2016, 01:46 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea
24/11/2016, 01:46 - Cindy LEUNG: And I tend to hv carb or veggies for dinner
24/11/2016, 01:46 - Cindy LEUNG: So following lunchtime experiment, the sleep is long
24/11/2016, 01:47 - Mom: Took shower?
24/11/2016, 01:48 - Cindy LEUNG: Yes I even wash my hair
24/11/2016, 01:53 - Cindy LEUNG: I also cut down on meal size, so I don't think that's the problem
24/11/2016, 01:55 - Mom: Size is not the prob, but it triggers the sleep
24/11/2016, 01:56 - Cindy LEUNG: Yess
24/11/2016, 01:57 - Cindy LEUNG: Also I only itch at night
24/11/2016, 01:57 - Cindy LEUNG: So üòìüòì
24/11/2016, 02:05 - Cindy LEUNG: It is now also the most stressful week in the term
24/11/2016, 02:06 - Mom: Do more work
24/11/2016, 02:07 - Cindy LEUNG: Cry
24/11/2016, 02:07 - Mom: For what?
24/11/2016, 02:07 - Cindy LEUNG: Everything
24/11/2016, 02:07 - Cindy LEUNG: U know how it works
24/11/2016, 02:07 - Cindy LEUNG: I figured out why they give u reading week
24/11/2016, 02:08 - Cindy LEUNG: They break the term into two
24/11/2016, 02:08 - Cindy LEUNG: So two cycles of five
24/11/2016, 02:08 - Cindy LEUNG: Or else u go mad
24/11/2016, 02:09 - Mom: So that's actually a break
24/11/2016, 02:09 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz once u fall behind on the work for one week u never catch up
24/11/2016, 02:09 - Mom: Sigh
24/11/2016, 02:09 - Cindy LEUNG: And if u hv assignment u will fall behind
24/11/2016, 02:10 - Cindy LEUNG: So week four is terrible
24/11/2016, 02:10 - Cindy LEUNG: And then they give u a reading week at week six
24/11/2016, 02:10 - Mom: Other ppl feel like that
24/11/2016, 02:10 - Cindy LEUNG: Or else u'll go jump off the roof
24/11/2016, 02:11 - Mom: Sigh
24/11/2016, 02:11 - Cindy LEUNG: Lol
24/11/2016, 02:11 - Mom: Not worth ur life for a deg

27/11/2016, 12:15 - Mom: he didn't go to nu?
27/11/2016, 12:15 - Cindy LEUNG: yeah i know
27/11/2016, 12:15 - Cindy LEUNG: but just in gen from the stuff i heard
27/11/2016, 12:15 - Mom: ic
27/11/2016, 12:15 - Cindy LEUNG: so that's why northwestern is better at micro
27/11/2016, 12:16 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz i know they developed this software to do agent-based modelling
27/11/2016, 12:16 - Cindy LEUNG: which is like a very new thing
27/11/2016, 12:16 - Mom: wow, that's why most grad from nu go to consulting
27/11/2016, 12:16 - Cindy LEUNG: probably
27/11/2016, 12:16 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz their skills are tailored towards strategy
27/11/2016, 12:17 - Cindy LEUNG: finance is more just excel crunching
27/11/2016, 12:17 - Cindy LEUNG: tbh
27/11/2016, 12:17 - Mom: but u need to go to Kellogg
27/11/2016, 12:17 - Cindy LEUNG: no lah
27/11/2016, 12:17 - Cindy LEUNG: u need a masters
27/11/2016, 12:17 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz nobody's gonna teach u agent based modelling in undergrad
27/11/2016, 12:17 - Mom: in kellogg?
27/11/2016, 12:17 - Cindy LEUNG: i think they do that in econ?
27/11/2016, 12:17 - Mom: probs
27/11/2016, 12:18 - Cindy LEUNG: its basically applied mathematics?
27/11/2016, 12:18 - Mom: applied maths?
27/11/2016, 12:18 - Cindy LEUNG: so kind of engineering, comp sci, econ and maths converge together after undergrad
27/11/2016, 12:19 - Cindy LEUNG: and then to model more complex systems, some people start looking at psychology and neuroscience to analyse irrational behavior
27/11/2016, 12:19 - Mom: how can a person get so many deg in different aspect?
27/11/2016, 12:19 - Cindy LEUNG: u don't all of them have basically the same fundamentals
27/11/2016, 12:19 - Mom: so basically maths rite
27/11/2016, 12:19 - Cindy LEUNG: yah
27/11/2016, 12:19 - Cindy LEUNG: its math
27/11/2016, 12:19 - Mom: ok
27/11/2016, 12:19 - Cindy LEUNG: but applied math is better
27/11/2016, 12:19 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz u need to think in terms of system
27/11/2016, 12:19 - Cindy LEUNG: ss
27/11/2016, 12:19 - Cindy LEUNG: and equilibrium
27/11/2016, 12:19 - Cindy LEUNG: not just theory
27/11/2016, 12:19 - Cindy LEUNG: like variables
27/11/2016, 12:20 - Cindy LEUNG: and u need to know how ur model might go wrong
27/11/2016, 12:20 - Mom: seems u learnt a lot of this stuff over the year before
27/11/2016, 12:20 - Cindy LEUNG: lol
27/11/2016, 12:20 - Cindy LEUNG: back to the
27/11/2016, 12:20 - Cindy LEUNG: LSE is not a bad school

27/11/2016, 12:21 - Mom: omg
27/11/2016, 12:22 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz there are bean bags
27/11/2016, 12:22 - Mom: did they brush their teeth?
27/11/2016, 12:22 - Cindy LEUNG: they stay overnight and go home i think
27/11/2016, 12:22 - Cindy LEUNG: i mean people sleep in the library all the time

27/11/2016, 12:34 - Mom: ok
27/11/2016, 12:34 - Cindy LEUNG: though its kind of annoying travelling iwth a large suitcase
27/11/2016, 12:34 - Cindy LEUNG: and im not planning on bringing more shit over
27/11/2016, 12:36 - Mom: sure

27/11/2016, 12:41 - Mom: becos it's approaching exam dates
27/11/2016, 12:41 - Cindy LEUNG: yeah
27/11/2016, 12:41 - Mom: better go out to work la
27/11/2016, 12:41 - Cindy LEUNG: and also dissertation deadline for masters
27/11/2016, 12:41 - Mom: so early?
27/11/2016, 12:42 - Cindy LEUNG: like outline
27/11/2016, 12:42 - Cindy LEUNG: one year is not a lot man, u gotta do research
27/11/2016, 12:42 - Cindy LEUNG: and write the goddamn thing
27/11/2016, 12:42 - Mom: sure, ik
27/11/2016, 12:43 - Cindy LEUNG: i rmb the indian girl basically locked herself in her room in second term last year
27/11/2016, 12:43 - Mom: but uk masters usually run one year
27/11/2016, 12:43 - Cindy LEUNG: the guy next door is so chill
27/11/2016, 12:43 - Mom: why?
27/11/2016, 12:43 - Cindy LEUNG: i think she was doing anf
27/11/2016, 12:43 - Cindy LEUNG: the guy next door is just doing managerial science
27/11/2016, 12:44 - Mom: maybe she had some insider way for exam paper?
27/11/2016, 12:44 - Cindy LEUNG: u can't have insider
27/11/2016, 12:44 - Cindy LEUNG: it hasn't even been written yet.
27/11/2016, 12:44 - Mom: what anf? u said she does geography?
27/11/2016, 12:44 - Cindy LEUNG: and he applied for a degree he already studied 70% of the content before already
27/11/2016, 12:44 - Cindy LEUNG: no the guy does masters
27/11/2016, 12:45 - Cindy LEUNG: yeah geography seems to be chill too, they never do work
27/11/2016, 12:46 - Cindy LEUNG: the only people who seem to work like mad in the whole school are the masters kids, those who take econ, math, politics, ir, law
27/11/2016, 12:46 - Cindy LEUNG: those are the only subjects i've seen people studying in the library
27/11/2016, 12:47 - Mom: these r the main courses which bring lse to top uni, tbh
27/11/2016, 12:47 - Cindy LEUNG: that's true
27/11/2016, 12:47 - Cindy LEUNG: i mean
27/11/2016, 12:47 - Cindy LEUNG: what good is a geography degree from lse
27/11/2016, 12:47 - Mom: just the lse name
27/11/2016, 12:48 - Mom: ppl don't care what deg ur doing if ur not in the finance, law and econ
27/11/2016, 12:48 - Cindy LEUNG: yeah cuz everything else channels into sales
27/11/2016, 12:48 - Cindy LEUNG: i don't think it matters for the girl anyways
27/11/2016, 12:48 - Mom: like if u apply for mgt trainee, co don't care what subject u did in lse
27/11/2016, 12:48 - Cindy LEUNG: she's gonna get married
27/11/2016, 12:49 - Mom: only if u can married to a rich guy
27/11/2016, 12:49 - Cindy LEUNG: saaah
27/11/2016, 12:49 - Cindy LEUNG: they all just want to get married and chill forever
27/11/2016, 12:49 - Mom: yea, top uni grad is an asset to the rich family
27/11/2016, 12:49 - Cindy LEUNG: yeah that's what the indian girl told me last year too
27/11/2016, 12:50 - Mom: this is true in hk and china as well
27/11/2016, 12:50 - Cindy LEUNG: i guess it doesn't matter what they do then
27/11/2016, 12:50 - Cindy LEUNG: they just here to improve their profile
27/11/2016, 12:51 - Mom: sure
27/11/2016, 12:51 - Cindy LEUNG: i've noticed there's so few irish and scottish people here
27/11/2016, 12:51 - Mom: ur so bossy
27/11/2016, 12:52 - Cindy LEUNG: dude there's nothing else to do
27/11/2016, 12:52 - Cindy LEUNG: during break
27/11/2016, 12:52 - Cindy LEUNG: plus u gotta know ur environment to know ur worth right
27/11/2016, 12:52 - Mom: i mean how do u know their nationalities?
27/11/2016, 12:53 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz accents
27/11/2016, 12:53 - Mom: ic
27/11/2016, 12:53 - Mom: did u talk to them?
27/11/2016, 12:53 - Cindy LEUNG: no u don't go around talking to random people
27/11/2016, 12:53 - Mom: i thought scottish ppl only go to uni in scotland
27/11/2016, 12:53 - Cindy LEUNG: i think so
27/11/2016, 12:53 - Mom: they can pay less in scotland
27/11/2016, 12:54 - Cindy LEUNG: yea
27/11/2016, 12:54 - Cindy LEUNG: maybe that's why
27/11/2016, 12:54 - Cindy LEUNG: i've seen one irish guy
27/11/2016, 12:54 - Cindy LEUNG: that's about it
27/11/2016, 12:55 - Cindy LEUNG: i think most brits tend to stay in their hometown as well
27/11/2016, 12:55 - Cindy LEUNG: actually kind of like the americans
27/11/2016, 12:55 - Cindy LEUNG: they tend to stay in their state
27/11/2016, 12:55 - Mom: hmm
27/11/2016, 12:56 - Cindy LEUNG: so i think sometimes they don't really understand why someone would go to uni in a faraway land
27/11/2016, 12:57 - Mom: no necessary if that's a really good uni like mit, harvard
27/11/2016, 12:57 - Cindy LEUNG: well yah
27/11/2016, 12:57 - Mom: americans still will go faraway
27/11/2016, 12:57 - Cindy LEUNG: but like u know urbana campaign
27/11/2016, 12:57 - Cindy LEUNG: wustl
27/11/2016, 12:58 - Mom: wustl is still a very good uni in the eye of americans
27/11/2016, 12:59 - Cindy LEUNG: yah
27/11/2016, 12:59 - Cindy LEUNG: but they're like
27/11/2016, 12:59 - Cindy LEUNG: why so many asians flock here?
27/11/2016, 12:59 - Mom: just mainlanders only
27/11/2016, 13:01 - Cindy LEUNG: and from their perspective, one space for intl means one less space for american
27/11/2016, 13:02 - Mom: i wud guess top american unis still give priorities to top americans instead of international students
27/11/2016, 13:02 - Cindy LEUNG: yeah
27/11/2016, 13:02 - Mom: like ur case, if u were american u probably got into johns hopkins
27/11/2016, 13:03 - Cindy LEUNG: but in lse there's a lot of intl so i think there are still tensions, but they can't do anything about it.
27/11/2016, 13:03 - Mom: lse is different, i guess
27/11/2016, 13:03 - Cindy LEUNG: idk
27/11/2016, 13:03 - Cindy LEUNG: maybe local kids still hate us
27/11/2016, 13:04 - Cindy LEUNG: but then its kind of hard to tell who's local and who's intl
27/11/2016, 13:04 - Mom: sure
27/11/2016, 13:05 - Cindy LEUNG: saaah
27/11/2016, 13:05 - Cindy LEUNG: thoughts from someone who needs more of a social life
28/11/2016, 02:12 - Cindy LEUNG: Lol I just spent four hrs playing democracy 3
28/11/2016, 02:12 - Cindy LEUNG: And I still fell asleep at 01:30
28/11/2016, 02:13 - Mom: Why?
28/11/2016, 02:13 - Cindy LEUNG: Why what?
28/11/2016, 02:13 - Mom: Play 4 hrs?
28/11/2016, 02:13 - Mom: Not revising
28/11/2016, 02:16 - Cindy LEUNG: Sunday night stress relief
28/11/2016, 02:16 - Mom: Did u sleep through the game
28/11/2016, 02:17 - Cindy LEUNG: No I fell asleep after I managed to balance out the us budget
28/11/2016, 02:17 - Cindy LEUNG: That was so hard üò†
28/11/2016, 02:17 - Cindy LEUNG: I got assassinated three times
28/11/2016, 02:18 - Mom: Anyone trying to balance out us budget is totally a dream
28/11/2016, 02:18 - Cindy LEUNG: And then I played UK version
28/11/2016, 02:19 - Cindy LEUNG: And then that was worse cuz there was nowhere to cut budget
28/11/2016, 02:19 - Mom: Hahaha
28/11/2016, 02:19 - Mom: Is that game theory
28/11/2016, 02:20 - Cindy LEUNG: No it's democracy 3
28/11/2016, 02:20 - Mom: Kk

28/11/2016, 18:03 - Cindy LEUNG: I was using my laptop in bed before going to sleep
28/11/2016, 18:03 - Cindy LEUNG: And then basically at some point
28/11/2016, 18:03 - Cindy LEUNG: I thought that there was someone behind the laptop, so in front of me
28/11/2016, 18:04 - Cindy LEUNG: I couldn't see anything cuz I don't tend to see stuff
28/11/2016, 18:04 - Cindy LEUNG: And I felt he/ she reach round the laptop and touch me in the face on both sides
28/11/2016, 18:05 - Cindy LEUNG: And then that basically scared me to sleeo
28/11/2016, 18:05 - Cindy LEUNG: And then I also felt a touch on my back
28/11/2016, 18:05 - Mom: U felt the touch of hands?
28/11/2016, 18:05 - Cindy LEUNG: I guess not hands
28/11/2016, 18:06 - Cindy LEUNG: But like I assumed was fingers
28/11/2016, 18:06 - Cindy LEUNG: Like they poked me in the face
28/11/2016, 18:06 - Cindy LEUNG: Dude. I don't think im haunted
28/11/2016, 18:06 - Mom: Same feel as on the back?
28/11/2016, 18:06 - Cindy LEUNG: But I don't think these count as sleep paralysis either
28/11/2016, 18:07 - Cindy LEUNG: I felt like a pat on the back
28/11/2016, 18:07 - Cindy LEUNG: And then I hid under the duvet
28/11/2016, 18:07 - Mom: Which area of the bsck?
28/11/2016, 18:07 - Cindy LEUNG: Like upper back
28/11/2016, 18:07 - Mom: Around spine?
28/11/2016, 18:08 - Mom: Having hidden under the duvet, nothing hspoened then?

28/11/2016, 18:52 - Cindy LEUNG: Just something weird in my brain
28/11/2016, 18:53 - Cindy LEUNG: I sort of accept that already
28/11/2016, 18:59 - Mom: Ur drean content is different now
28/11/2016, 19:18 - Cindy LEUNG: Yah

28/11/2016, 19:41 - Cindy LEUNG: AHaha
28/11/2016, 19:42 - Cindy LEUNG: I realise I am in a prisoner's dilemma situation with my flatmates
28/11/2016, 19:43 - Cindy LEUNG: I wanna poison them everyday and the only thing stopping me from doing so is that I still need to live here tmr
28/11/2016, 19:44 - Cindy LEUNG: Gv225 has also taught me that this is called grim trigger
28/11/2016, 19:44 - Cindy LEUNG: Fml

29/11/2016, 00:09 - Mom: Haaa
29/11/2016, 00:11 - Cindy LEUNG: sigh
29/11/2016, 00:11 - Cindy LEUNG: i don't know if this my clothes
29/11/2016, 00:11 - Cindy LEUNG: or wat
29/11/2016, 00:12 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz i share washing machine with like 400 other disgusting people
29/11/2016, 00:12 - Cindy LEUNG: who knows if they have herpes or some untreated skin disease
29/11/2016, 00:13 - Mom: If washer prob, u wud have radhes all over ur body not just left side
29/11/2016, 00:13 - Cindy LEUNG: yea thats true
29/11/2016, 00:13 - Mom: What abt ur undee?
29/11/2016, 00:13 - Cindy LEUNG: my body is so divided these days
29/11/2016, 00:14 - Cindy LEUNG: ?
29/11/2016, 00:14 - Mom: Hand wash?
29/11/2016, 00:14 - Cindy LEUNG: no i throw everything into the washer
29/11/2016, 00:14 - Cindy LEUNG: there's nowhere to for water to run if i hand wash it
29/11/2016, 00:15 - Cindy LEUNG: the other bathroom has turned into a sewer as far as i know
29/11/2016, 00:15 - Mom: omg
29/11/2016, 00:16 - Mom: if u bring clothes to laundry shop, u still have to share the washer with hundred of other unknown persons
29/11/2016, 00:17 - Cindy LEUNG: yah
29/11/2016, 00:17 - Cindy LEUNG: so nevermind
29/11/2016, 00:17 - Cindy LEUNG: its unavoidable
29/11/2016, 00:17 - Mom: yea
29/11/2016, 00:20 - Mom: u said ur body is divided these days, how?
29/11/2016, 00:20 - Cindy LEUNG: left and right
29/11/2016, 00:20 - Cindy LEUNG: very divisive between left and right
29/11/2016, 00:21 - Mom: in what way
29/11/2016, 00:21 - Mom: just rashes
29/11/2016, 00:21 - Cindy LEUNG: like different things happen between left and right
29/11/2016, 00:21 - Cindy LEUNG: yea i guess only the rash
29/11/2016, 00:21 - Cindy LEUNG: i can think of for now
29/11/2016, 00:22 - Cindy LEUNG: oh well nothing says that rashes have to be on both sides
29/11/2016, 00:22 - Mom: surely not eczema, cuz eczema rashes ususally appear on both sides symmetrically
29/11/2016, 00:23 - Cindy LEUNG: yeah
29/11/2016, 00:23 - Cindy LEUNG: my point
29/11/2016, 00:23 - Mom: and they won't show up on ur abdomen
29/11/2016, 00:24 - Cindy LEUNG: i wonder if fungi
29/11/2016, 00:24 - Cindy LEUNG: i just put some tridem on it
29/11/2016, 00:24 - Cindy LEUNG: see if it works
29/11/2016, 00:24 - Cindy LEUNG: i doubt so though
29/11/2016, 00:25 - Cindy LEUNG: they kinda appeared as little bumps
29/11/2016, 00:25 - Cindy LEUNG: and i scratched them
29/11/2016, 00:25 - Cindy LEUNG: and then turned like tis
29/11/2016, 00:25 - Mom: still constipation?
29/11/2016, 00:25 - Cindy LEUNG: yea i think constipation increased
29/11/2016, 00:25 - Mom: how many days?
29/11/2016, 00:25 - Mom: without poo
29/11/2016, 00:25 - Cindy LEUNG: er i just went today
29/11/2016, 00:26 - Cindy LEUNG: but its dry poop
29/11/2016, 00:26 - Cindy LEUNG: they're like malteser
29/11/2016, 00:26 - Cindy LEUNG: its not as bad as hk
29/11/2016, 00:26 - Cindy LEUNG: where i don't even shit
29/11/2016, 00:26 - Mom: i was thinking if they're caused by the bacteria inside ur gut
29/11/2016, 00:27 - Cindy LEUNG: what you mean the rash?
29/11/2016, 00:27 - Cindy LEUNG: nah
29/11/2016, 00:27 - Cindy LEUNG: dun think so
29/11/2016, 00:27 - Cindy LEUNG: it sort of coincides with the sweating
29/11/2016, 00:27 - Cindy LEUNG: now i sweat less.
29/11/2016, 00:27 - Cindy LEUNG: sort of stopped sweating and hotness
29/11/2016, 00:27 - Cindy LEUNG: this
29/11/2016, 00:27 - Cindy LEUNG: wek
29/11/2016, 00:27 - Mom: rashes appear with less sweat?
29/11/2016, 00:28 - Cindy LEUNG: well the little bumps appeared when i was still sweating
29/11/2016, 00:28 - Cindy LEUNG: and then i scratched them adn they turned into rash and then i stopped sweating as much
29/11/2016, 00:28 - Cindy LEUNG: like i sweat normal person amounts now
29/11/2016, 00:29 - Cindy LEUNG: by normal person, i actually mean normal person cuz i asked other people how much they sweat in the morning
29/11/2016, 00:29 - Cindy LEUNG: like a weirdo
29/11/2016, 00:29 - Mom: oh the rashes r inflammation becoz u scratched the bumps
29/11/2016, 00:29 - Cindy LEUNG: no
29/11/2016, 00:29 - Cindy LEUNG: they're dry
29/11/2016, 00:30 - Mom: inflammation does have to be wet
29/11/2016, 00:30 - Cindy LEUNG: like they're not healing
29/11/2016, 00:30 - Mom: probably hormonal effect plus scratching making them inflammation
29/11/2016, 00:31 - Cindy LEUNG: ok
29/11/2016, 00:31 - Cindy LEUNG: on one side
29/11/2016, 00:31 - Mom: this is the point
29/11/2016, 00:31 - Cindy LEUNG: its spreading to the underbra line
29/11/2016, 00:31 - Cindy LEUNG: you know that bit that gets itchy if ur bra is dirty?
29/11/2016, 00:31 - Cindy LEUNG: but my bras are new
29/11/2016, 00:32 - Cindy LEUNG: and they aren't dirty
29/11/2016, 00:32 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz i change them everyday
29/11/2016, 00:32 - Mom: hmm
29/11/2016, 00:32 - Mom: can't figure it out
29/11/2016, 00:32 - Mom: r they very itchy?
29/11/2016, 00:32 - Cindy LEUNG: not very but yes itchy
29/11/2016, 00:33 - Mom: try not to scratch them
29/11/2016, 00:33 - Cindy LEUNG: ok
29/11/2016, 00:33 - Mom: i think the spread out is a result of ur scratching?
29/11/2016, 00:33 - Cindy LEUNG: possibly
29/11/2016, 00:33 - Mom: so possible eczema??
29/11/2016, 00:33 - Cindy LEUNG: no
29/11/2016, 00:33 - Cindy LEUNG: its not eczema
29/11/2016, 00:33 - Mom: or bacterial infection
29/11/2016, 00:34 - Cindy LEUNG: its not a bacterial infection
29/11/2016, 00:34 - Cindy LEUNG: my skin is not that wek
29/11/2016, 00:34 - Mom: how's it look like if u put 974 instead of triderm?
29/11/2016, 00:35 - Cindy LEUNG: dunno haven't tried
29/11/2016, 00:35 - Mom: if triderm didn't work, try differrent thing like 974 ointment
29/11/2016, 00:36 - Cindy LEUNG: ok
29/11/2016, 00:38 - Cindy LEUNG: anyways
29/11/2016, 00:38 - Cindy LEUNG: i had instant noodles for dinner
29/11/2016, 00:38 - Cindy LEUNG: at around 2000
29/11/2016, 00:38 - Cindy LEUNG: and then i fell asleep
29/11/2016, 00:38 - Cindy LEUNG: pretty quickly
29/11/2016, 00:39 - Cindy LEUNG: i think i slept for more than 30 mins
29/11/2016, 00:39 - Cindy LEUNG: and my position was like head down, drooling
29/11/2016, 00:39 - Cindy LEUNG: so this is different from the avocado sleep
29/11/2016, 00:40 - Cindy LEUNG: avocado sleep i was aware that i went it sleep when it happened
29/11/2016, 00:40 - Cindy LEUNG: instant noodles -- only knew i slept after i woke up
29/11/2016, 00:40 - Cindy LEUNG: and then i went to sleep in the bed
29/11/2016, 00:40 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz i was cold
29/11/2016, 00:41 - Cindy LEUNG: and i had vivid dream
29/11/2016, 00:41 - Mom: this is the first time u had instant noodle?
29/11/2016, 00:41 - Cindy LEUNG: no i had instant noodles a couple of times before
29/11/2016, 00:41 - Cindy LEUNG: what happens after is similar
29/11/2016, 00:42 - Mom: fall asleep instantly and had vivid dream?
29/11/2016, 00:42 - Cindy LEUNG: yea like a combination of the two
29/11/2016, 00:43 - Cindy LEUNG: its like not like the avocado one
29/11/2016, 00:43 - Cindy LEUNG: with the avocado
29/11/2016, 00:44 - Cindy LEUNG: i might -- hear some weird stuff before going into the sleep episode, and then i will be aware of everything happening at least in beginning, and i also feel a lot of stuff buzzing in my head
29/11/2016, 00:44 - Mom: but sleep for 30 mins or more isn't a short time
29/11/2016, 00:44 - Cindy LEUNG: ? so
29/11/2016, 00:44 - Cindy LEUNG: the avocado sleep is shorter
29/11/2016, 00:45 - Cindy LEUNG: there's also no drooling
29/11/2016, 00:45 - Cindy LEUNG: so i think different things happen to different sets of muscles
29/11/2016, 00:45 - Mom: have u ever had instant noodle in the morning?
29/11/2016, 00:45 - Cindy LEUNG: no
29/11/2016, 00:45 - Mom: same experience?

29/11/2016, 00:46 - Cindy LEUNG: there's no class on tuesdays
29/11/2016, 00:46 - Mom: ok
29/11/2016, 00:46 - Mom: is instant noodle only made with flour?
29/11/2016, 00:47 - Cindy LEUNG: well i assumed its carb heavy
29/11/2016, 00:47 - Cindy LEUNG: and avocado is fat
29/11/2016, 00:47 - Cindy LEUNG: so that's why i use those foods
29/11/2016, 00:47 - Mom: wheat flour, google said
29/11/2016, 00:48 - Mom: what abt if u dine at ipudo? also fall asleep very quickly?

29/11/2016, 00:54 - Cindy LEUNG: adn the experiment is slightly different cuz there's walking afterwards
29/11/2016, 00:54 - Cindy LEUNG: i would walk at least 30 mins after eating at ippudo
29/11/2016, 00:56 - Mom: still feel hot at mid-night?
29/11/2016, 00:57 - Cindy LEUNG: not as much
29/11/2016, 00:57 - Cindy LEUNG: it happen with the stopping of the sweating
29/11/2016, 00:57 - Cindy LEUNG: and
29/11/2016, 00:57 - Cindy LEUNG: to make things more complicated
29/11/2016, 00:57 - Cindy LEUNG: it also got a lot colder

29/11/2016, 01:01 - Cindy LEUNG: after 2 years
29/11/2016, 01:02 - Mom: ikik

29/11/2016, 01:04 - Mom: that means in an hr or two
29/11/2016, 01:04 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz i feel like i'm physiologically addicted to sugar
29/11/2016, 01:04 - Mom: how's ur body's reaction to those sugar?
29/11/2016, 01:04 - Cindy LEUNG: dunno
29/11/2016, 01:04 - Mom: no sleeping?
29/11/2016, 01:04 - Mom: after that?
29/11/2016, 01:05 - Cindy LEUNG: well i had at night
29/11/2016, 01:05 - Cindy LEUNG: so couldn't tell
29/11/2016, 01:05 - Cindy LEUNG: yea
29/11/2016, 01:05 - Cindy LEUNG: everytime i have sugar
29/11/2016, 01:05 - Cindy LEUNG: i feel immense guilt
29/11/2016, 01:05 - Mom: u just told me that u need to limit sugar intake to 6 tsp a day, and now u ate sugar
29/11/2016, 01:06 - Mom: üò°
29/11/2016, 01:06 - Mom: limit ur sugar intake ahhhhh
29/11/2016, 01:06 - Cindy LEUNG: see u yelling at me doesn't work
29/11/2016, 01:07 - Cindy LEUNG: i ate sugar cuz i need energy to work
29/11/2016, 01:07 - Mom: u need to eat food, not sugar
29/11/2016, 01:07 - Mom: u had too little food, i guess
29/11/2016, 01:07 - Cindy LEUNG: i sleep every time i eat proper food
29/11/2016, 01:08 - Cindy LEUNG: so i need small amount of concentrated sugar
29/11/2016, 01:08 - Mom: ok la
29/11/2016, 01:08 - Cindy LEUNG: so i bought a bag of gummies
29/11/2016, 01:08 - Cindy LEUNG: and then it disappeared
29/11/2016, 01:09 - Cindy LEUNG: now i have chocolate bars instead
29/11/2016, 01:09 - Cindy LEUNG: it seems to work better
29/11/2016, 01:09 - Mom: ur going to eat a lot of gummies, i guess
29/11/2016, 01:09 - Mom: what better? no sleep after chocolate bar?
29/11/2016, 01:09 - Cindy LEUNG: yea
29/11/2016, 01:10 - Mom: live off chocolate bars human being?? weird
29/11/2016, 01:11 - Cindy LEUNG: i usually have a chocolate bar and coffee for lunch
29/11/2016, 01:12 - Cindy LEUNG: so now go back to the avocado
29/11/2016, 01:12 - Mom: what abt avocado?
29/11/2016, 01:12 - Cindy LEUNG: avocado is essentially plant fat
29/11/2016, 01:12 - Cindy LEUNG: right
29/11/2016, 01:12 - Mom: yea
29/11/2016, 01:13 - Cindy LEUNG: chocolate is also essentially sugar and fat
29/11/2016, 01:13 - Mom: unsaturated fat
29/11/2016, 01:13 - Cindy LEUNG: and i tried riceball as well
29/11/2016, 01:13 - Cindy LEUNG: that's essentially carb == simple sugar
29/11/2016, 01:13 - Mom: yea
29/11/2016, 01:13 - Cindy LEUNG: so riceball --> induce sleep
29/11/2016, 01:13 - Cindy LEUNG: avocado --> induce
29/11/2016, 01:13 - Cindy LEUNG: sleep
29/11/2016, 01:13 - Cindy LEUNG: chocolate bar doesn't induce sleep
29/11/2016, 01:13 - Cindy LEUNG: ???
29/11/2016, 01:13 - Mom: same magnitude?
29/11/2016, 01:14 - Mom: for riceball and avocado?
29/11/2016, 01:14 - Cindy LEUNG: what do you mean by magnitude?
29/11/2016, 01:14 - Mom: same time fall asleep after eating
29/11/2016, 01:15 - Cindy LEUNG: well i never had avocado at lunch, but during bkf i would say i fall asleep more quickly
29/11/2016, 01:15 - Cindy LEUNG: this is after 1 avocado
29/11/2016, 01:16 - Mom: just avocado, no drink?
29/11/2016, 01:16 - Cindy LEUNG: i drink milk tea in the morning
29/11/2016, 01:16 - Mom: did u eat it together with coffee?
29/11/2016, 01:16 - Cindy LEUNG: i don't thnk tht drink plays a part
29/11/2016, 01:17 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz no effect if i have the drink on its own
29/11/2016, 01:17 - Cindy LEUNG: the riceball is about 100g of rice i would say
29/11/2016, 01:17 - Cindy LEUNG: like half a bowl of rice
29/11/2016, 01:18 - Cindy LEUNG: and then with that i just get sleepy
29/11/2016, 01:18 - Cindy LEUNG: and become difficult to work
29/11/2016, 01:18 - Cindy LEUNG: i need to purposely go to sleep on my own
29/11/2016, 01:18 - Cindy LEUNG: so difference is that i don't fall into sleep automatically
29/11/2016, 01:19 - Cindy LEUNG: however i wonder if that changes with the amount of carbs i eat
29/11/2016, 01:19 - Cindy LEUNG: as if u compare the instant noodles
29/11/2016, 01:19 - Cindy LEUNG: that's obviously more carbs
29/11/2016, 01:19 - Cindy LEUNG: and i fell asleep automatically
29/11/2016, 01:19 - Cindy LEUNG: soo
29/11/2016, 01:19 - Cindy LEUNG: chocolate bar --- 1 bar is 80g
29/11/2016, 01:20 - Mom: r those instant noodles made with saturated fat as well?
29/11/2016, 01:21 - Cindy LEUNG: its' just Âá∫Ââç‰∏ÄÈ°∂
29/11/2016, 01:21 - Cindy LEUNG: ‰∏Å
29/11/2016, 01:22 - Mom: i mean that instant noodle isn't just carbs rich only but also with lots of fats
29/11/2016, 01:22 - Cindy LEUNG: but i guess u're right, instant noodles have fat content as well
29/11/2016, 01:22 - Mom: problem is fat??
29/11/2016, 01:22 - Cindy LEUNG: yeah i was thinking about this
29/11/2016, 01:22 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz the avocado is plant fat
29/11/2016, 01:22 - Cindy LEUNG: and that's different from animal fat
29/11/2016, 01:22 - Mom: what if u don't go to sleep after eating riceball, wud that sleepy feeling go away later?
29/11/2016, 01:23 - Cindy LEUNG: no
29/11/2016, 01:23 - Cindy LEUNG: maybe
29/11/2016, 01:23 - Cindy LEUNG: i'd spend like 2 hrs in that foggy state
29/11/2016, 01:23 - Cindy LEUNG: and then become frustrated
29/11/2016, 01:23 - Mom: wow, so long time
29/11/2016, 01:24 - Cindy LEUNG: even with sleep, the whole ordeal lasts 1 hr post meal
29/11/2016, 01:24 - Mom: and if u sleep for like 20 to 30 mins, u'll be refresh again rite?
29/11/2016, 01:24 - Cindy LEUNG: i think so
29/11/2016, 01:24 - Cindy LEUNG: wait no
29/11/2016, 01:24 - Cindy LEUNG: not 20 to 30 mins
29/11/2016, 01:24 - Cindy LEUNG: i sleep for much longer
29/11/2016, 01:24 - Cindy LEUNG: and i take a couple of naps
29/11/2016, 01:24 - Cindy LEUNG: basically i sleep for like an hr post meal
29/11/2016, 01:25 - Mom: wow, that's long time
29/11/2016, 01:25 - Mom: try a day with chocolate bars only
29/11/2016, 01:25 - Mom: see what happen
29/11/2016, 01:26 - Cindy LEUNG: yeah so i was thinking possibly the type of sleep induced by the foods is different
29/11/2016, 01:26 - Cindy LEUNG: ok
29/11/2016, 01:26 - Cindy LEUNG: also with teh chocolate, i don't eat it all at once u know, i take it in small chunks
29/11/2016, 01:28 - Cindy LEUNG: i think that makes a difference
29/11/2016, 01:28 - Cindy LEUNG: at this point
29/11/2016, 01:28 - Cindy LEUNG: i think i should test response to different fats
29/11/2016, 01:29 - Cindy LEUNG: and try the chocolate bar day
29/11/2016, 01:29 - Mom: but the weird thing is u didn't sleep that long time after meal when u were in hk
29/11/2016, 01:29 - Cindy LEUNG: which meal u talking about
29/11/2016, 01:30 - Mom: i can't think of much difference
29/11/2016, 01:30 - Cindy LEUNG: it could be that i slept in a bed
29/11/2016, 01:30 - Cindy LEUNG: which does seem to make a difference
29/11/2016, 01:30 - Cindy LEUNG: possibly due to the position -- which affects the breathing
29/11/2016, 01:31 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz i notice that more muscles go completely relaxed after high carb
29/11/2016, 01:32 - Cindy LEUNG: with avocado -- i don't think the muscles actually relax, i just remember that i can't move my arms adn then my body when it happens
29/11/2016, 01:33 - Cindy LEUNG: so its more of a paralysis
29/11/2016, 01:33 - Cindy LEUNG: than weakness
29/11/2016, 01:34 - Cindy LEUNG: so that's why im guessing one of the food cause nrem and the other cause rem
29/11/2016, 01:34 - Cindy LEUNG: which would explain why my symptoms seem to be so different
29/11/2016, 01:34 - Mom: which food cause rem do u think?
29/11/2016, 01:34 - Cindy LEUNG: the avocado
29/11/2016, 01:35 - Cindy LEUNG: --- its the seizure-like state i've been trying to describe
29/11/2016, 01:35 - Mom: can u recall dreams after having avocado sleep/
29/11/2016, 01:35 - Cindy LEUNG: i maintain consciousness in beginning and have vivid dreams
29/11/2016, 01:35 - Cindy LEUNG: ya
29/11/2016, 01:35 - Mom: oh possible
29/11/2016, 01:35 - Cindy LEUNG: with the carbs -- i just wake up
29/11/2016, 01:36 - Cindy LEUNG: and then i'm like 'oh, i fell asleep'
29/11/2016, 01:36 - Mom: nrem possible
29/11/2016, 01:36 - Cindy LEUNG: and i drool with the carbs
29/11/2016, 01:36 - Cindy LEUNG: so the mouth/ jaw goes lax
29/11/2016, 01:37 - Cindy LEUNG: the avocado- i think the jaw chatters
29/11/2016, 01:37 - Cindy LEUNG: so i keep describing shaking cuz of that
29/11/2016, 01:37 - Mom: ai, awareness of sleep seems not matching??
29/11/2016, 01:38 - Cindy LEUNG: what do you mean?
29/11/2016, 01:38 - Mom: if u go into nrem, the process shud be gradual and u shud be aware of the sleepiness
29/11/2016, 01:39 - Cindy LEUNG: hmm well with riceball -- i am aware of sleepiness
29/11/2016, 01:39 - Mom: whereas in rem sleep, opposite thing happens
29/11/2016, 01:39 - Cindy LEUNG: but if i eat a lot of carbs -- then i just fall into like a 'food coma'
29/11/2016, 01:39 - Cindy LEUNG: possibly depend on size of the meal
29/11/2016, 01:39 - Cindy LEUNG: the riceball- def sound like nrem then
29/11/2016, 01:40 - Cindy LEUNG: so it would be in this situation that i try to do math and i can't and i either draw ink blots in my book or write random things
29/11/2016, 01:42 - Cindy LEUNG: so now i think about teh cataplexy
29/11/2016, 01:42 - Cindy LEUNG: i would say its more like the rem
29/11/2016, 01:43 - Cindy LEUNG: i go into a paralysis
29/11/2016, 01:44 - Mom: i told u long time ago, cataplexy resembles rem sleeep, didn't I?
29/11/2016, 01:44 - Cindy LEUNG: yea
29/11/2016, 01:44 - Cindy LEUNG: but then we also agreed that i don't have narco
29/11/2016, 01:44 - Cindy LEUNG: which means whether i have cataplexy should be called into question
29/11/2016, 01:44 - Cindy LEUNG: but now it seems i may actually have cataplexy
29/11/2016, 01:45 - Mom: idk
29/11/2016, 01:46 - Mom: the triggering event is so difficult to tell
29/11/2016, 01:47 - Cindy LEUNG: one more similarity
29/11/2016, 01:47 - Cindy LEUNG: is that
29/11/2016, 01:47 - Cindy LEUNG: my eyes roll back
29/11/2016, 01:47 - Cindy LEUNG: in avocado sleep
29/11/2016, 01:47 - Cindy LEUNG: and supposed cataplexy
29/11/2016, 01:47 - Mom: feeling happy? eating avocado?
29/11/2016, 01:48 - Cindy LEUNG: yea
29/11/2016, 01:48 - Cindy LEUNG: i'm called them that now
29/11/2016, 01:48 - Mom: u feel immediate happy after eating avocado?
29/11/2016, 01:48 - Cindy LEUNG: no
29/11/2016, 01:48 - Cindy LEUNG: those are two different events
29/11/2016, 01:49 - Cindy LEUNG: avocado sleep is the sleep which is induced by eating an avocado
29/11/2016, 01:49 - Cindy LEUNG: cataplexy is temporary paralysis induced by funny thing
29/11/2016, 01:49 - Cindy LEUNG: and in both cases, the eyes will roll back
29/11/2016, 01:50 - Mom: induced by strong emotions if according to standard definition
29/11/2016, 01:50 - Cindy LEUNG: well i can tell u the emotions are not that strong
29/11/2016, 01:50 - Mom: do u feel very happy eating an avocado?
29/11/2016, 01:50 - Cindy LEUNG: =.=
29/11/2016, 01:51 - Cindy LEUNG: i feel like u still misunderstand
29/11/2016, 01:51 - Mom: no, i get what u mean
29/11/2016, 01:51 - Cindy LEUNG: i don't get cataplexy from eating an avocado
29/11/2016, 01:51 - Mom: but the effect is same
29/11/2016, 01:51 - Cindy LEUNG: not exactly
29/11/2016, 01:51 - Cindy LEUNG: similar
29/11/2016, 01:51 - Mom: rem sleep
29/11/2016, 01:52 - Cindy LEUNG: one is a sleep state
29/11/2016, 01:52 - Cindy LEUNG: and the other is liek a temporary paralysis
29/11/2016, 01:52 - Cindy LEUNG: ok that's different
29/11/2016, 01:52 - Cindy LEUNG: and they both bear similarities to this rem sleep stage
29/11/2016, 01:54 - Cindy LEUNG: interesting thing is
29/11/2016, 01:54 - Cindy LEUNG: in riceball sleep
29/11/2016, 01:54 - Cindy LEUNG: migraine-like symptoms increase
29/11/2016, 01:54 - Mom: i still think u shud do a neuroscience masters
29/11/2016, 01:54 - Cindy LEUNG: and then i get double vision
29/11/2016, 01:54 - Mom: headache?
29/11/2016, 01:55 - Cindy LEUNG: ocular migraine
29/11/2016, 01:55 - Mom: üòÆ
29/11/2016, 01:55 - Cindy LEUNG: so the green text could possibly be aura
29/11/2016, 01:55 - Cindy LEUNG: but main thing is double vision
29/11/2016, 01:56 - Cindy LEUNG: which prevents me from reading
29/11/2016, 01:56 - Cindy LEUNG: and then sometimes a colorless pattern sort of blocks my field of vision
29/11/2016, 01:56 - Cindy LEUNG: and it makes it difficult to focus on teh text
29/11/2016, 01:57 - Mom: colourless pattern?
29/11/2016, 01:57 - Cindy LEUNG: yes its hard to describe
29/11/2016, 01:57 - Cindy LEUNG: but imagine like compound eyes
29/11/2016, 01:58 - Mom: u just can't focus with compound eyes, not colourless pattern
29/11/2016, 01:58 - Cindy LEUNG: ok i just googled it
29/11/2016, 01:58 - Cindy LEUNG: not correct
29/11/2016, 01:58 - Cindy LEUNG: like
29/11/2016, 01:59 - Cindy LEUNG: its basically kind of liek a migraine aura
29/11/2016, 01:59 - Cindy LEUNG: and it distorts your field of vision
29/11/2016, 02:00 - Cindy LEUNG: so u can't focus
29/11/2016, 02:01 - Cindy LEUNG: ok i thought of a good example
29/11/2016, 02:01 - Cindy LEUNG: like
29/11/2016, 02:01 - Cindy LEUNG: if u think aobut like a diamond grid
29/11/2016, 02:02 - Cindy LEUNG: kind of like this: https://d2gg9evh47fn9z.cloudfront.net/thumb_COLOURBOX10072187.jpg
29/11/2016, 02:03 - Cindy LEUNG: and then imagine each diamond is a small piece of magnifying glass
29/11/2016, 02:03 - Cindy LEUNG: and then u put that panel over a block of text
29/11/2016, 02:04 - Cindy LEUNG: and u try to focus on te text
29/11/2016, 02:04 - Cindy LEUNG: it sort of looks liek that
29/11/2016, 02:19 - Mom: take a rest first, it's already 2 am
29/11/2016, 02:20 - Cindy LEUNG: i'm currently typing everything out in a word doc
29/11/2016, 06:03 - Mom: „Äê‰ªäÊó•Á¨ë‰∏ÄÁ¨ë„ÄëÊçâÂà∞‰Ω† ÂñµÊòü‰∫∫Ë¶ÅÊçâËá™Â∑±ÂÄãÂΩ±

29/11/2016, 06:36 - Cindy LEUNG: Omg I needed a cat video
29/11/2016, 06:37 - Cindy LEUNG: It is freaking 1 degree in london
29/11/2016, 06:37 - Cindy LEUNG: I just yelled in my dream again
29/11/2016, 06:37 - Cindy LEUNG: Yelled out loud
29/11/2016, 07:04 - Mom: nightmare again?
29/11/2016, 08:06 - Cindy LEUNG: https://youtu.be/stXhGMVJuqA
29/11/2016, 08:07 - Cindy LEUNG: The MIT guy says some pretty interesting things
29/11/2016, 08:08 - Mom: K
29/11/2016, 08:08 - Mom: Watching it now
29/11/2016, 08:10 - Cindy LEUNG: The Minnesotan says u treat rem sleep behaviour disorder with benzos
29/11/2016, 08:10 - Cindy LEUNG: Just skip the birds
29/11/2016, 08:11 - Mom: it seems benzos doesn't work very well on u
29/11/2016, 08:13 - Cindy LEUNG: Well idk
29/11/2016, 08:13 - Cindy LEUNG: Actually I remember it shorten my sleep
29/11/2016, 08:14 - Mom: ur response to drug isn't that as expected
29/11/2016, 08:14 - Mom: sometimes even with opposite effect
29/11/2016, 08:34 - Cindy LEUNG: Hv u watched?
29/11/2016, 08:34 - Mom: sorry, just working on dates
29/11/2016, 08:35 - Mom: will watch in a min
29/11/2016, 10:11 - Mom: well, finish but i fall asleep after the mit speaker until almost the end of the video
29/11/2016, 10:44 - Cindy LEUNG: Lol me too
29/11/2016, 10:45 - Cindy LEUNG: The memory models theory is really nice isn't it
29/11/2016, 10:45 - Cindy LEUNG: Not saying it's true
29/11/2016, 10:45 - Cindy LEUNG: But it's just really nice
29/11/2016, 10:46 - Cindy LEUNG: But I think wht he's saying is quite plausible as well
29/11/2016, 10:46 - Cindy LEUNG: Cuz I do notice two different sets of dreams that I hv
29/11/2016, 10:47 - Cindy LEUNG: The medical part is a bit uninspiring
29/11/2016, 10:47 - Cindy LEUNG: They just cuz benzos
29/11/2016, 10:47 - Mom: the mops is out
29/11/2016, 10:47 - Cindy LEUNG: Just use benzos
29/11/2016, 10:47 - Cindy LEUNG: Oh
29/11/2016, 10:48 - Cindy LEUNG: I talk to u then
29/11/2016, 10:48 - Cindy LEUNG: The lady at the reception counter
29/11/2016, 10:48 - Mom: ...go read a magazine
29/11/2016, 10:49 - Cindy LEUNG: Hahaha
29/11/2016, 10:49 - Cindy LEUNG: Hows life
29/11/2016, 10:49 - Mom: sticky

29/11/2016, 10:50 - Cindy LEUNG: Its winter
29/11/2016, 10:51 - Cindy LEUNG: How's math

29/11/2016, 10:57 - Mom: not econ
29/11/2016, 10:58 - Mom: oh the mops is in again

29/11/2016, 10:58 - Cindy LEUNG: Why
29/11/2016, 10:59 - Cindy LEUNG: Life sounds chill kanaa
29/11/2016, 11:02 - Mom: are u gonna viene a hong kong
29/11/2016, 11:03 - Cindy LEUNG: Around dec10
29/11/2016, 11:03 - Cindy LEUNG: Then I sleep and library for like three weeks
29/11/2016, 11:04 - Mom: oh lol my last day is 13dec
29/11/2016, 11:10 - Mom: hi (mops)
29/11/2016, 11:12 - Mom: the memory part that mit guy said is like what i used to talk abt ur dream construction rite?
29/11/2016, 11:24 - Cindy LEUNG: yea
29/11/2016, 11:25 - Cindy LEUNG: like i can't exactly create things in my dream
29/11/2016, 11:25 - Cindy LEUNG: just direct it to certain content
29/11/2016, 11:26 - Cindy LEUNG: i just thought his theory was close
29/11/2016, 11:26 - Cindy LEUNG: and its was nice and beautiful sounding as well
29/11/2016, 11:26 - Cindy LEUNG: the medical side was a bit uninspiring
29/11/2016, 11:27 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz he only mentions clonazepam as treatment
29/11/2016, 11:28 - Cindy LEUNG: thought i wonder if i count as rem sleep behavior disorder
29/11/2016, 11:28 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz i don't move
29/11/2016, 11:28 - Cindy LEUNG: so i'm okay?
29/11/2016, 11:28 - Cindy LEUNG: there are few times i talk out loud
29/11/2016, 11:30 - Cindy LEUNG: i don't think im genetic case
29/11/2016, 11:30 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz i have no past history
29/11/2016, 11:31 - Mom: sure not genetic
29/11/2016, 11:31 - Cindy LEUNG: seems more like epigenetics -- as my symptoms are very transitory phase
29/11/2016, 11:31 - Mom: and not rem sleep behavior disorder
29/11/2016, 11:31 - Mom: epigenetics idk
29/11/2016, 11:31 - Cindy LEUNG: but rbd is an umbrella term?
29/11/2016, 11:32 - Cindy LEUNG: or does it just mean sleep walking?
29/11/2016, 11:32 - Mom: ur symptoms don't match very much with its definition
29/11/2016, 11:33 - Mom: did u act out ur dream?
29/11/2016, 11:33 - Cindy LEUNG: hmm yah
29/11/2016, 11:33 - Cindy LEUNG: no
29/11/2016, 11:33 - Cindy LEUNG: key factor is u act out the dream
29/11/2016, 11:33 - Mom: yea
29/11/2016, 11:33 - Cindy LEUNG: but he also says that clonazepam reduces dreaming
29/11/2016, 11:33 - Mom: key factor is ur muscle system is out of control
29/11/2016, 11:34 - Mom: is that benzos?
29/11/2016, 11:34 - Cindy LEUNG: u think so?
29/11/2016, 11:34 - Cindy LEUNG: yea
29/11/2016, 11:34 - Mom: actually i slept after 40 mins of the video, so i didn't listen to that part
29/11/2016, 11:34 - Cindy LEUNG: ok but u heard the mit guy
29/11/2016, 11:34 - Cindy LEUNG: so that's ok
29/11/2016, 11:34 - Cindy LEUNG: u have sleep dep
29/11/2016, 11:35 - Mom: u tried benzos before, do u think it works for ur insonmia?
29/11/2016, 11:35 - Cindy LEUNG: erm...
29/11/2016, 11:35 - Cindy LEUNG: its more of a muscle relaxant
29/11/2016, 11:35 - Cindy LEUNG: and it makes me sleep short
29/11/2016, 11:35 - Cindy LEUNG: shorter
29/11/2016, 11:35 - Mom: i don't have sleep deprivation, its just nocturnally affected sleep pattern
29/11/2016, 11:36 - Cindy LEUNG: no i fell asleep three times during that whole video
29/11/2016, 11:36 - Cindy LEUNG: but i think i only napped like 5 mins every time
29/11/2016, 11:36 - Mom: i nap in day time a lot
29/11/2016, 11:37 - Cindy LEUNG: yah normal
29/11/2016, 11:37 - Mom: and usually more than 30 mins
29/11/2016, 11:37 - Cindy LEUNG: normal
29/11/2016, 11:37 - Cindy LEUNG: power naps aren't normal imo
29/11/2016, 11:37 - Mom: i was sitting at the desk and lean my head on the head rest and then fell asleep
29/11/2016, 11:37 - Cindy LEUNG: yah normal
29/11/2016, 11:38 - Cindy LEUNG: i do that sometimes
29/11/2016, 11:38 - Cindy LEUNG: after riceball
29/11/2016, 11:39 - Mom: actually this is not quite normal for a person to nap so many times
29/11/2016, 11:39 - Cindy LEUNG: yah
29/11/2016, 11:39 - Cindy LEUNG: but avocado sleep is def not normal
29/11/2016, 11:39 - Mom: this is strange
29/11/2016, 11:40 - Cindy LEUNG: ive been thinking something wrong with my ganglion cells, which switches motor control on and off
29/11/2016, 11:40 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz
29/11/2016, 11:40 - Mom: i never read a post abt a narco who falls asleep after eating avocado
29/11/2016, 11:40 - Cindy LEUNG: i thought about why i can't stand
29/11/2016, 11:40 - Cindy LEUNG: and i realise i'm not actually sure whether my leg muscles go weak
29/11/2016, 11:40 - Cindy LEUNG: or that my brain stops my legs from moving.
29/11/2016, 11:40 - Mom: why not sure?
29/11/2016, 11:41 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz i can't tell
29/11/2016, 11:41 - Cindy LEUNG: like with my arm
29/11/2016, 11:41 - Cindy LEUNG: my forearms can actually go numb really easily
29/11/2016, 11:42 - Cindy LEUNG: whenever i rest on my elbows for extended period
29/11/2016, 11:42 - Cindy LEUNG: they go numb
29/11/2016, 11:42 - Mom: like paralysed?
29/11/2016, 11:42 - Cindy LEUNG: yeah
29/11/2016, 11:42 - Cindy LEUNG: if long enough
29/11/2016, 11:42 - Cindy LEUNG: is that normal?
29/11/2016, 11:43 - Mom: if long enough?
29/11/2016, 11:43 - Mom: what does that mean?
29/11/2016, 11:43 - Cindy LEUNG: like if i rest on my elbows for long enough
29/11/2016, 11:43 - Cindy LEUNG: and it remains in that numb condition
29/11/2016, 11:43 - Mom: where do u rest ur elbows?
29/11/2016, 11:43 - Cindy LEUNG: on the desk
29/11/2016, 11:43 - Cindy LEUNG: when i'm looking at ipad
29/11/2016, 11:43 - Cindy LEUNG: in bed
29/11/2016, 11:43 - Cindy LEUNG: esp in bed
29/11/2016, 11:44 - Mom: like ppl can't walk having sit on the chair for long time and not moving?
29/11/2016, 11:44 - Cindy LEUNG: yeah
29/11/2016, 11:45 - Cindy LEUNG: they call that 'go to sleep'
29/11/2016, 11:45 - Cindy LEUNG: and then when u stand up there's pins and needles
29/11/2016, 11:45 - Cindy LEUNG: i wonder if doing that too much affects ur brain
29/11/2016, 11:45 - Mom: prolong pressure at a point of ur body?
29/11/2016, 11:45 - Cindy LEUNG: yea
29/11/2016, 11:45 - Mom: sure not la
29/11/2016, 11:46 - Mom: do u have this experience before yr 12?
29/11/2016, 11:46 - Cindy LEUNG: hmmm
29/11/2016, 11:46 - Cindy LEUNG: yeah
29/11/2016, 11:46 - Cindy LEUNG: my limbs go to sleep pretty easily
29/11/2016, 11:46 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz i sit on them a lot
29/11/2016, 11:46 - Mom: even when ur at middle skl?
29/11/2016, 11:46 - Cindy LEUNG: yah
29/11/2016, 11:46 - Mom: i don't think it a brain problem
29/11/2016, 11:47 - Cindy LEUNG: well how this is related
29/11/2016, 11:47 - Cindy LEUNG: is that
29/11/2016, 11:47 - Cindy LEUNG: during avocado sleep
29/11/2016, 11:47 - Cindy LEUNG: the first sign is
29/11/2016, 11:47 - Cindy LEUNG: my arms go into paralysis really quickly
29/11/2016, 11:48 - Cindy LEUNG: remember the video i sent u last march or april?
29/11/2016, 11:48 - Cindy LEUNG: similar sort of thing as that
29/11/2016, 11:48 - Cindy LEUNG: my arms go weak really quickly
29/11/2016, 11:49 - Cindy LEUNG: so i can still move my hand to move the mouse to start webcam if i work fast
29/11/2016, 11:49 - Cindy LEUNG: but only have time to do small things like that before it happens
29/11/2016, 11:49 - Cindy LEUNG: and in order to move to do that, i put in a lot of effort to just fight the paralysis
29/11/2016, 11:50 - Cindy LEUNG: so what that means it
29/11/2016, 11:50 - Cindy LEUNG: it probably can't be the arms muscles themselves suddenly paralysing
29/11/2016, 11:50 - Cindy LEUNG: but the something in the brain
29/11/2016, 11:50 - Cindy LEUNG: like the switch off mechanism happening.
29/11/2016, 11:50 - Mom: i can't remember any of such kind of situation happened to u when ur younger, or since birth
29/11/2016, 11:50 - Cindy LEUNG: u wouldn't know would u
29/11/2016, 11:51 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz its not like i report everytime my arm goes numb
29/11/2016, 11:51 - Mom: why don't? i never seen this before
29/11/2016, 11:51 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz it only happens when i prop them up on my elbows
29/11/2016, 11:51 - Cindy LEUNG: and for extended periods
29/11/2016, 11:51 - Cindy LEUNG: as in hrs
29/11/2016, 11:51 - Cindy LEUNG: and hrs
29/11/2016, 11:51 - Mom: haaaa
29/11/2016, 11:52 - Cindy LEUNG: and i lose feeling in them
29/11/2016, 11:52 - Mom: so ur guessing ur brain has problem since long time ago
29/11/2016, 11:52 - Cindy LEUNG: and then after i'm done, i return to normal position
29/11/2016, 11:52 - Cindy LEUNG: and then i get pins and needles for a while
29/11/2016, 11:52 - Cindy LEUNG: and then my arms are fine
29/11/2016, 11:52 - Mom: this is normal woo
29/11/2016, 11:53 - Cindy LEUNG: well we don't know what happens if that happens too frequently
29/11/2016, 11:53 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz its like cutting off sensation
29/11/2016, 11:53 - Cindy LEUNG: right?
29/11/2016, 11:55 - Cindy LEUNG: anyways the point why i mention that is that
29/11/2016, 11:55 - Cindy LEUNG: it is clear that brain cells decide to switch off motor control in arms
29/11/2016, 11:55 - Cindy LEUNG: and not other way round
29/11/2016, 11:55 - Cindy LEUNG: so
29/11/2016, 11:55 - Cindy LEUNG: possibly
29/11/2016, 11:55 - Cindy LEUNG: same thing happen with legs
29/11/2016, 11:56 - Cindy LEUNG: but i tell doctors that my muscles go weak
29/11/2016, 11:56 - Cindy LEUNG: so  they might
29/11/2016, 11:56 - Cindy LEUNG: think bottom up
29/11/2016, 11:56 - Cindy LEUNG: instead of top down
29/11/2016, 11:56 - Cindy LEUNG: the med std saw it in person, so he was like def a neurological condition
29/11/2016, 11:56 - Mom: why ur brain decides to shut down the channel?
29/11/2016, 11:57 - Cindy LEUNG: probably part of normal procedure for rem sleep
29/11/2016, 11:57 - Cindy LEUNG: part of sleep regulation system
29/11/2016, 11:57 - Mom: hmm
29/11/2016, 11:57 - Cindy LEUNG: though the bad news now is
29/11/2016, 11:57 - Mom: ur pointing to hypothalamus
29/11/2016, 11:57 - Cindy LEUNG: if i knew how to fix a broken system
29/11/2016, 11:57 - Cindy LEUNG: then i could solve every single problem in the world
29/11/2016, 11:58 - Cindy LEUNG: and i would win the nobel peace prize
29/11/2016, 11:58 - Cindy LEUNG: har harh ar
29/11/2016, 11:59 - Mom: what did the med stud see when u had an episode?
29/11/2016, 11:59 - Mom: collapse or sleep?
29/11/2016, 12:00 - Cindy LEUNG: well
29/11/2016, 12:00 - Cindy LEUNG: we walked out of the ramen shop
29/11/2016, 12:00 - Cindy LEUNG: and then i was walking like normal
29/11/2016, 12:01 - Cindy LEUNG: and then i couldn't put one leg in front of the other
29/11/2016, 12:01 - Cindy LEUNG: and then my eyes roll back and i was dizzy
29/11/2016, 12:01 - Cindy LEUNG: and then i fell into a squat
29/11/2016, 12:01 - Cindy LEUNG: and collapsed onto the ground
29/11/2016, 12:02 - Cindy LEUNG: and then i couldn't move for about 10 secs
29/11/2016, 12:02 - Cindy LEUNG: he was asking whether i was a 'fainter'
29/11/2016, 12:02 - Cindy LEUNG: and then i sat up and got up and proceed as normal
29/11/2016, 12:02 - Cindy LEUNG: not sure what triggered that one
29/11/2016, 12:02 - Cindy LEUNG: possibly 'happy'?
29/11/2016, 12:03 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz i have ramen with my friend everyweek
29/11/2016, 12:03 - Cindy LEUNG: and i don't collapse everyweek
29/11/2016, 12:04 - Cindy LEUNG: i also talked to my flatmate from last year the other day
29/11/2016, 12:04 - Cindy LEUNG: and then same thing happen when we were talking
29/11/2016, 12:04 - Cindy LEUNG: but that was when i was standing
29/11/2016, 12:04 - Cindy LEUNG: though
29/11/2016, 12:04 - Cindy LEUNG: i kind of tell jokes all the time
29/11/2016, 12:05 - Cindy LEUNG: and people basically laugh at generally anything i say....
29/11/2016, 12:05 - Cindy LEUNG: soo
29/11/2016, 12:05 - Cindy LEUNG: id
29/11/2016, 12:05 - Cindy LEUNG: idk
29/11/2016, 12:07 - Mom: triggering event is unclear
29/11/2016, 12:07 - Cindy LEUNG: yea could be anything really
29/11/2016, 12:07 - Cindy LEUNG: including change of location
29/11/2016, 12:08 - Cindy LEUNG: going down stairs
29/11/2016, 12:08 - Mom: this is why i insist ur symptoms can't be classified as narco or cataplexy, but i rlly dunno what exactly is
29/11/2016, 12:08 - Mom: really frustrating
29/11/2016, 12:09 - Cindy LEUNG: there is one more interesting thing.
29/11/2016, 12:09 - Cindy LEUNG: when i drink alcohol
29/11/2016, 12:09 - Cindy LEUNG: the falling is a bit different
29/11/2016, 12:09 - Cindy LEUNG: i fall backwards
29/11/2016, 12:10 - Cindy LEUNG: and then lie on the floor
29/11/2016, 12:10 - Cindy LEUNG: but this is like back in may so i don't know if that change
29/11/2016, 12:10 - Cindy LEUNG: and i have to have drank quite a lot to be like that
29/11/2016, 12:10 - Cindy LEUNG: i definitely was not drunk though
29/11/2016, 12:11 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz i could walk in straight line
29/11/2016, 12:11 - Cindy LEUNG: i remember this, cuz the guys made me walk in a straight line
29/11/2016, 12:12 - Cindy LEUNG: just interesting thoughts for the day
29/11/2016, 12:12 - Cindy LEUNG: time to head to the lib
29/11/2016, 12:14 - Mom: k
30/11/2016, 04:31 - Mom: i watched the video again, third speaker isn't that inspiring cuz i read those info from online long time ago, but the recorded rbd video is rather interesting and somewhat horror
30/11/2016, 04:42 - Mom: in fact animal sleep is rather interesting especially when they confronted with threats, they have one eye opened while the other closed??
30/11/2016, 08:47 - Mom: hi
30/11/2016, 11:23 - Cindy LEUNG: hi

30/11/2016, 11:29 - Cindy LEUNG: 1. hormonal cycle
30/11/2016, 11:29 - Cindy LEUNG: 2. drop in stress levels
30/11/2016, 11:30 - Mom: definite la
30/11/2016, 11:30 - Cindy LEUNG: both are pretty likely
30/11/2016, 11:30 - Cindy LEUNG: so i dunno which one
30/11/2016, 11:30 - Cindy LEUNG: also the rash has subsided
30/11/2016, 11:30 - Cindy LEUNG: last week i was really feeling the stress cuz there was a lot to do
30/11/2016, 11:30 - Cindy LEUNG: so this week is like the 'reading week' effect
30/11/2016, 11:30 - Cindy LEUNG: the crash
30/11/2016, 11:30 - Cindy LEUNG: except its not reading week
30/11/2016, 11:31 - Cindy LEUNG: but my body decides to chill nonetheless
30/11/2016, 11:31 - Cindy LEUNG: in a one month cycle
30/11/2016, 11:31 - Cindy LEUNG: it can spend three weeks with gradually increasing stress
30/11/2016, 11:31 - Cindy LEUNG: and then one week crash
30/11/2016, 11:33 - Mom: at least good for no more itchy, rashes, hot flashes
30/11/2016, 11:33 - Cindy LEUNG: but that's only temporary
30/11/2016, 11:33 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz its a cycle
30/11/2016, 11:33 - Cindy LEUNG: yesterday my fingers were still itchy as hell and then i put them in really hot water
30/11/2016, 11:34 - Mom: be careful not to burn ur finger
30/11/2016, 11:34 - Cindy LEUNG: now they are dry af
30/11/2016, 11:34 - Cindy LEUNG: but i dare not put anything on it
30/11/2016, 11:35 - Mom: at least u've learnt of this cycle, u know how to cope with them in the future
30/11/2016, 11:35 - Cindy LEUNG: lol, now we need to think of coping
30/11/2016, 11:35 - Mom: which mean ur stress is reduced
30/11/2016, 11:35 - Cindy LEUNG: like now to reduce stress?
30/11/2016, 11:35 - Cindy LEUNG: how
30/11/2016, 11:35 - Cindy LEUNG: i don't think that's possible
30/11/2016, 11:36 - Cindy LEUNG: the problem is more like: how to raise the tolerance bar
30/11/2016, 11:36 - Mom: i mean u know what they are when they come out, this is expectation and it costs u less stress
30/11/2016, 11:36 - Cindy LEUNG: i guess fair enough
30/11/2016, 11:36 - Cindy LEUNG: secondly
30/11/2016, 11:37 - Mom: expected means ur prepared for those things coming
30/11/2016, 11:37 - Mom: less anxiety due to unknown thingy
30/11/2016, 11:37 - Cindy LEUNG: well i think now we know that dreaming is more linked to the stress response than emotion
30/11/2016, 11:38 - Mom: why stress?
30/11/2016, 11:38 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz dreams is like situational training
30/11/2016, 11:38 - Cindy LEUNG: they prep u for fight v flight
30/11/2016, 11:38 - Cindy LEUNG: i think
30/11/2016, 11:39 - Cindy LEUNG: that's how i interpret what the mit guy is saying
30/11/2016, 11:39 - Mom: that's not said in the video
30/11/2016, 11:39 - Cindy LEUNG: he says its test running the models of the world ur mind forms from past memories right
30/11/2016, 11:40 - Mom: actually i don't rlly understand this meaning
30/11/2016, 11:40 - Cindy LEUNG: erm ok so he says that nrem
30/11/2016, 11:41 - Mom: yea for nrem
30/11/2016, 11:41 - Cindy LEUNG: u reflect on past experience
30/11/2016, 11:41 - Cindy LEUNG: like the rat in the maze
30/11/2016, 11:41 - Cindy LEUNG: hes like thinking of future and past
30/11/2016, 11:41 - Cindy LEUNG: not present
30/11/2016, 11:42 - Cindy LEUNG: so what he's saying is that nrem sleep is like extended day dreaming
30/11/2016, 11:42 - Cindy LEUNG: or self-reflection, when brain thinks about abstract things
30/11/2016, 11:43 - Cindy LEUNG: and then so we have this pile of data about past, it needs to sort of form and recognize significant links between these pieces of data
30/11/2016, 11:43 - Cindy LEUNG: so what the brain does is then
30/11/2016, 11:44 - Cindy LEUNG: it forms a lot of models of the world, randomly? i dunno he doesn't elaborate
30/11/2016, 11:44 - Cindy LEUNG: and u test run them during rem
30/11/2016, 11:44 - Mom: nrem
30/11/2016, 11:44 - Cindy LEUNG: so that is why u see a lot of weird scary stuff during rem
30/11/2016, 11:44 - Cindy LEUNG: no testing is in rem
30/11/2016, 11:44 - Cindy LEUNG: nrem is just backlogging
30/11/2016, 11:45 - Cindy LEUNG: dunno when model making happens -- probably during nrem as well
30/11/2016, 11:45 - Cindy LEUNG: by modelling, he just means making links between the data
30/11/2016, 11:45 - Cindy LEUNG: understanding what it means
30/11/2016, 11:46 - Mom: i got this part, but so much as yrs
30/11/2016, 11:47 - Mom: not so much
30/11/2016, 11:47 - Cindy LEUNG: so it would make sense that nightmares are more common than pleasant dreams
30/11/2016, 11:47 - Cindy LEUNG: right? cuz the brain is forming bizarre links between uncorrelated info
30/11/2016, 11:47 - Cindy LEUNG: so u get weird stuff happening
30/11/2016, 11:47 - Cindy LEUNG: like cucumber people
30/11/2016, 11:47 - Mom: hmm
30/11/2016, 11:47 - Cindy LEUNG: or whatever
30/11/2016, 11:48 - Cindy LEUNG: i've actually seen that
30/11/2016, 11:48 - Mom: in ur dream?
30/11/2016, 11:48 - Cindy LEUNG: yea
30/11/2016, 11:48 - Mom: why i didn't
30/11/2016, 11:48 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz u didn't form link between cucumber and people
30/11/2016, 11:49 - Mom: u mean i don't have creativity
30/11/2016, 11:49 - Cindy LEUNG: yea i think creativity is linked with how bizarre ur dreams are
30/11/2016, 11:49 - Mom: possible
30/11/2016, 11:49 - Cindy LEUNG: if u define creativity as the ability to form links between uncorrelated data
30/11/2016, 11:49 - Cindy LEUNG: but the thing is
30/11/2016, 11:50 - Cindy LEUNG: we don't know how bizarre ur dreams are
30/11/2016, 11:50 - Mom: that's why genius were always regarded as crazy ppl
30/11/2016, 11:50 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz u normally don't remember them
30/11/2016, 11:51 - Cindy LEUNG: i think with rem dreams -- u supposed to vaguely remember having dreams but not remember them down to scene by scene
30/11/2016, 11:51 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz they're scary
30/11/2016, 11:52 - Cindy LEUNG: the brain knows it'll trigger ur fear response
30/11/2016, 11:52 - Cindy LEUNG: so in order to not do that
30/11/2016, 11:52 - Cindy LEUNG: it makes u forget them
30/11/2016, 11:53 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz u can't turn off the fear response, its autonomous
30/11/2016, 11:53 - Mom: no ah, in rem sleep u can recall the dreams vividly
30/11/2016, 11:53 - Cindy LEUNG: only very vivid dreams
30/11/2016, 11:53 - Cindy LEUNG: and u can only remember briefly
30/11/2016, 11:53 - Cindy LEUNG: longer if u write them down
30/11/2016, 11:53 - Mom: hmm
30/11/2016, 11:54 - Cindy LEUNG: basically the brain doesn't remember dream data cuz its like the registry data of the computer
30/11/2016, 11:54 - Cindy LEUNG: its trash after the process is finished
30/11/2016, 11:55 - Cindy LEUNG: why i remember so many of my dreams is that i got into the habit of writing them all down
30/11/2016, 11:55 - Mom: can u recall them now without seeing ur notes?
30/11/2016, 11:56 - Cindy LEUNG: no not really
30/11/2016, 11:56 - Cindy LEUNG: by remember
30/11/2016, 11:56 - Cindy LEUNG: i mean
30/11/2016, 11:56 - Cindy LEUNG: like why i can sustain my memories of the dreams for longer than say an hour
30/11/2016, 11:56 - Cindy LEUNG: normally u forget them within 15 mins
30/11/2016, 11:57 - Mom: if then, it won't affect ur emotion after having nightmares
30/11/2016, 11:57 - Cindy LEUNG: what u mean if u forget them within 15mins?
30/11/2016, 11:58 - Mom: but u seems so irritated by those nightmares
30/11/2016, 11:58 - Cindy LEUNG: yea why do i get really really vivid nightmares
30/11/2016, 11:59 - Cindy LEUNG: ok the issue that
30/11/2016, 11:59 - Mom: i rmb the mit guy said dream might involve learning
30/11/2016, 11:59 - Cindy LEUNG: i am really conscious in my rem dreams
30/11/2016, 11:59 - Cindy LEUNG: this is the learning process
30/11/2016, 12:00 - Mom: u shud becoz ur at the pre-arousal level
30/11/2016, 12:00 - Cindy LEUNG: and i also remember my dreams longer than most people
30/11/2016, 12:00 - Cindy LEUNG: including the content
30/11/2016, 12:01 - Cindy LEUNG: most people just vaguely remember that they dreamt and maybe remember a few things they saw
30/11/2016, 12:01 - Cindy LEUNG: so probably i produced an amplified stress response to my nightmares
30/11/2016, 12:02 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz remember they weren't supposed to last
30/11/2016, 12:02 - Mom: ur nightmare or dreams ususally can't be interpreted as in a movie script, didn't u realise
30/11/2016, 12:02 - Cindy LEUNG: and then if u recall, in the beginning i kept on waking up once i was killed/murdered
30/11/2016, 12:03 - Mom: yea
30/11/2016, 12:03 - Cindy LEUNG: and then later on in august, i started waking on anticipation of something bad happening
30/11/2016, 12:03 - Cindy LEUNG: that is a conditioning response
30/11/2016, 12:03 - Mom: sort of
30/11/2016, 12:04 - Cindy LEUNG: so in other words, i developed a fear of sleeping essentially.
30/11/2016, 12:04 - Cindy LEUNG: which would explain why when i got here and slept alone, i would have panic attacks if i slept in the dark
30/11/2016, 12:04 - Mom: but the fact is u don't have those kind of dream anymore, how did u get rid of it?
30/11/2016, 12:04 - Cindy LEUNG: hurr, well
30/11/2016, 12:05 - Cindy LEUNG: idk
30/11/2016, 12:05 - Cindy LEUNG: but my dreams are more related to stress reponse
30/11/2016, 12:05 - Mom: i can tell
30/11/2016, 12:06 - Cindy LEUNG: so it would make sense that i dream about things that i feel like i am unprepared for
30/11/2016, 12:06 - Cindy LEUNG: i mean he's right, dreams are mostly related with aggression activity
30/11/2016, 12:07 - Cindy LEUNG: they induce fear
30/11/2016, 12:07 - Cindy LEUNG: in terms of emotion
30/11/2016, 12:07 - Cindy LEUNG: not pleasant things
30/11/2016, 12:07 - Cindy LEUNG: which is why the amygdala plays a role
30/11/2016, 12:08 - Cindy LEUNG: i've been thinking that
30/11/2016, 12:08 - Cindy LEUNG: if cataplexy is some form of rem sleep
30/11/2016, 12:08 - Cindy LEUNG: then it should really be just related to the most primitive emotions
30/11/2016, 12:09 - Cindy LEUNG: or like things which aren't really considered emotions -- basically pleasure and fear
30/11/2016, 12:09 - Cindy LEUNG: so is pleasure the trigger?
30/11/2016, 12:09 - Cindy LEUNG: remember i did respond to horror movies by collapsing as well
30/11/2016, 12:09 - Mom: ppl say laughter
30/11/2016, 12:09 - Cindy LEUNG: noooo
30/11/2016, 12:10 - Cindy LEUNG: its not laughter
30/11/2016, 12:10 - Cindy LEUNG: or happy
30/11/2016, 12:10 - Cindy LEUNG: by pleasure
30/11/2016, 12:10 - Cindy LEUNG: i just mean things which makes the brain feel good
30/11/2016, 12:10 - Mom: remember the stanford definition?
30/11/2016, 12:10 - Cindy LEUNG: well i scrap the stanford def
30/11/2016, 12:10 - Cindy LEUNG: they say laughter
30/11/2016, 12:11 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz when u laugh u definitely feel pleasure right
30/11/2016, 12:11 - Cindy LEUNG: same with happy
30/11/2016, 12:11 - Cindy LEUNG: but when u laugh out of courtesey
30/11/2016, 12:11 - Cindy LEUNG: or because of amusement
30/11/2016, 12:11 - Cindy LEUNG: that's not really pleasure?
30/11/2016, 12:12 - Mom: hmm
30/11/2016, 12:12 - Cindy LEUNG: i also feel like all this is linked to dopamine
30/11/2016, 12:13 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz dopamine is related to pleasure
30/11/2016, 12:13 - Cindy LEUNG: and addiction would cause dopamine depletion
30/11/2016, 12:14 - Cindy LEUNG: not to mention it also works with acetylcholine which could possibly explain why it affect motor control
30/11/2016, 12:15 - Mom: u had addiction? what?
30/11/2016, 12:15 - Cindy LEUNG: ok why i mention addiction
30/11/2016, 12:15 - Cindy LEUNG: remember sugar
30/11/2016, 12:15 - Cindy LEUNG: our good friend sugar
30/11/2016, 12:15 - Mom: lolz
30/11/2016, 12:15 - Cindy LEUNG: we agree that i was eating sugar at insane levels right
30/11/2016, 12:16 - Mom: yea
30/11/2016, 12:16 - Cindy LEUNG: sugar can affect dopamine receptors
30/11/2016, 12:16 - Cindy LEUNG: in other words, i think i was addicted to sugar
30/11/2016, 12:16 - Cindy LEUNG: which affected my dopamine levels
30/11/2016, 12:17 - Mom: can ur body normalise ur dopamine levels?
30/11/2016, 12:17 - Cindy LEUNG: er idk
30/11/2016, 12:17 - Cindy LEUNG: look at addiction treatments
30/11/2016, 12:17 - Cindy LEUNG: if addiction problem this would be similar to like a cocaine or heroin case
30/11/2016, 12:17 - Cindy LEUNG: and u would agree addiction to those drugs would seriously fuck up a brain right
30/11/2016, 12:18 - Cindy LEUNG: so i think it is pretty plausible that excessive consumption of sugar would throw my sleep regulatory system out of whack
30/11/2016, 12:18 - Mom: hmm
30/11/2016, 12:18 - Mom: this is interesting interpretation
30/11/2016, 12:18 - Cindy LEUNG: luckily
30/11/2016, 12:19 - Mom: but very innovative thoughts
30/11/2016, 12:19 - Cindy LEUNG: there is a lot of research on addiction
30/11/2016, 12:19 - Mom: suga makes ppl crazy
30/11/2016, 12:19 - Cindy LEUNG: ofc
30/11/2016, 12:19 - Cindy LEUNG: its worse than salt
30/11/2016, 12:19 - Cindy LEUNG: though to be fair
30/11/2016, 12:19 - Cindy LEUNG: i ate a lot of it
30/11/2016, 12:20 - Cindy LEUNG: like i'm pretty sure 10mg of cocaine won't kill u
30/11/2016, 12:20 - Cindy LEUNG: but like 1kg of it wil
30/11/2016, 12:22 - Cindy LEUNG: white people really like drugs eh
30/11/2016, 12:25 - Mom: it's hilarious
30/11/2016, 12:26 - Cindy LEUNG: yupp
30/11/2016, 12:26 - Cindy LEUNG: this confirms my theory
30/11/2016, 12:26 - Cindy LEUNG: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15987666
30/11/2016, 12:26 - Mom: gp don't usually prescribe drugs when ur sick but ppl use them regularly
30/11/2016, 12:27 - Cindy LEUNG: yea...
30/11/2016, 12:28 - Cindy LEUNG: so now i'm probably just extra sensitive to stress
30/11/2016, 12:28 - Cindy LEUNG: which is probably not a good thing.
30/11/2016, 12:29 - Cindy LEUNG: makes me scared of everything.
30/11/2016, 12:29 - Cindy LEUNG: and i have heightened response to everything as well
30/11/2016, 12:30 - Mom: u know how scientists tell ppl to deal with anxiety or fear?
30/11/2016, 12:30 - Cindy LEUNG: i think this would explain why i have so many symptoms of stress problem but im on regular levels of stress
30/11/2016, 12:30 - Mom: to face them directly
30/11/2016, 12:30 - Cindy LEUNG: yeah that won't work with me
30/11/2016, 12:30 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz its my threshold which is lowered.
30/11/2016, 12:31 - Cindy LEUNG: so things u normally aren't supposed to be scared of, i am anxious about.
30/11/2016, 12:31 - Cindy LEUNG: so does this still count as a stress problem?
30/11/2016, 12:31 - Cindy LEUNG: its not that i have too much stress
30/11/2016, 12:31 - Mom: omg
30/11/2016, 12:31 - Cindy LEUNG: but that my system has lower threshold?
30/11/2016, 12:32 - Cindy LEUNG: because sugar and dopamine threw my system out of whack
30/11/2016, 12:32 - Cindy LEUNG: i remember i took acetylcoa last year and that was probably the only supplement i took which showed any effects
30/11/2016, 12:32 - Cindy LEUNG: so i was on the right track then
30/11/2016, 12:34 - Mom: how's ur effect after taking that supplement?
30/11/2016, 12:34 - Cindy LEUNG: i observed i napped less
30/11/2016, 12:34 - Cindy LEUNG: and didn't go into sleep that easily
30/11/2016, 12:34 - Cindy LEUNG: but i was really really tired
30/11/2016, 12:35 - Cindy LEUNG: but i had a problem with it, can't remember what
30/11/2016, 12:35 - Cindy LEUNG: so i stopped
30/11/2016, 12:35 - Cindy LEUNG: oh
30/11/2016, 12:35 - Cindy LEUNG: constipation
30/11/2016, 12:35 - Cindy LEUNG: it makes u really constipated
30/11/2016, 12:36 - Cindy LEUNG: at least for me that is the case
30/11/2016, 12:36 - Mom: how long u tried that supplement?
30/11/2016, 12:37 - Cindy LEUNG: oh like a few weeks
30/11/2016, 12:37 - Cindy LEUNG: quite long
30/11/2016, 12:37 - Mom: perhaps u can give another trial in the summer
30/11/2016, 12:37 - Cindy LEUNG: ok
30/11/2016, 12:37 - Mom: will addiction happen for that drug?
30/11/2016, 12:38 - Cindy LEUNG: no its a supplement
30/11/2016, 12:38 - Cindy LEUNG: its supposed to help u replenish dopamine levels
30/11/2016, 12:38 - Cindy LEUNG: addiction goes the other way round -- causes dopa depletion
30/11/2016, 12:38 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz dopamine release makes u feel good
30/11/2016, 12:39 - Cindy LEUNG: and then u're tooked
30/11/2016, 12:39 - Cindy LEUNG: hooked
30/11/2016, 12:40 - Cindy LEUNG: as long as those cells are not dead
30/11/2016, 12:40 - Cindy LEUNG: its recoverable
30/11/2016, 12:41 - Cindy LEUNG: if u look at symptoms of parkinson's
30/11/2016, 12:41 - Cindy LEUNG: its kind of similar to what i describe, but at a more severe level
30/11/2016, 12:42 - Mom: so terrible
30/11/2016, 12:42 - Mom: üò©
30/11/2016, 12:42 - Cindy LEUNG: yea in parkinson's, the dopamine cells are dead
30/11/2016, 12:43 - Cindy LEUNG: and in the video, the neurologist did mention that there is a high conversion rate of people with rbd to pd
30/11/2016, 12:43 - Mom: will those ppl with parkinson disorder having cataplexy?
30/11/2016, 12:44 - Cindy LEUNG: tremour
30/11/2016, 12:44 - Cindy LEUNG: falls and dizziness
30/11/2016, 12:44 - Cindy LEUNG: eye problems
30/11/2016, 12:44 - Cindy LEUNG: fatigue
30/11/2016, 12:44 - Cindy LEUNG: freezing
30/11/2016, 12:44 - Cindy LEUNG: skin and sweat problems
30/11/2016, 12:44 - Cindy LEUNG: sleep problems
30/11/2016, 12:45 - Cindy LEUNG: swallowing problems
30/11/2016, 12:45 - Cindy LEUNG: anxiety
30/11/2016, 12:45 - Cindy LEUNG: dementia
30/11/2016, 12:45 - Cindy LEUNG: depression
30/11/2016, 12:45 - Cindy LEUNG: hallucinations and delusions
30/11/2016, 12:46 - Mom: üò∞
30/11/2016, 12:46 - Cindy LEUNG: that is a very apt response
30/11/2016, 12:46 - Cindy LEUNG: but early detection is reversable
30/11/2016, 12:47 - Mom: ü§îü§îü§î
30/11/2016, 12:50 - Cindy LEUNG: yah
30/11/2016, 12:50 - Cindy LEUNG: now the problem is that there is a barrier between me and medication
30/11/2016, 12:51 - Mom: u can just tell dr to prescribe u med based on ur findings, they thought ur crazy
30/11/2016, 12:51 - Cindy LEUNG: lol possibly
30/11/2016, 12:52 - Cindy LEUNG: idk
30/11/2016, 12:52 - Mom: but if u said that supplement is effective, can u try that?
30/11/2016, 12:52 - Cindy LEUNG: i dunno if effective
30/11/2016, 12:52 - Cindy LEUNG: it just had effect
30/11/2016, 12:53 - Mom: btw, how wud u test if ur dopamine level raise to normal or not?
30/11/2016, 12:53 - Cindy LEUNG: fuck u google, there is no specific test for parkinsons
30/11/2016, 12:54 - Cindy LEUNG: i don't think neurotransmitter levels are testable
30/11/2016, 12:54 - Cindy LEUNG: that's the problem
30/11/2016, 12:55 - Cindy LEUNG: they can only make diagnosis based on review of medical history
30/11/2016, 12:55 - Cindy LEUNG: so basically their guess is as good as mine
30/11/2016, 12:55 - Mom: for dopamine level?
30/11/2016, 12:55 - Cindy LEUNG: yea
30/11/2016, 12:55 - Cindy LEUNG: or whether u have parkinson's
30/11/2016, 12:55 - Cindy LEUNG: or whatever
30/11/2016, 12:55 - Cindy LEUNG: its like narco
30/11/2016, 12:56 - Cindy LEUNG: except narco there is gene sequencing and also the spinal tap
30/11/2016, 12:56 - Cindy LEUNG: yep there is no biological marker
30/11/2016, 12:58 - Cindy LEUNG: seems like medication is basically a mess concerning neurological diseases
30/11/2016, 12:59 - Mom: but there's ample room to research
30/11/2016, 12:59 - Cindy LEUNG: ahahahaha
30/11/2016, 13:00 - Mom: job security
30/11/2016, 13:00 - Cindy LEUNG: i think i should go do chem afterwards
30/11/2016, 13:00 - Cindy LEUNG: wasted talent
30/11/2016, 13:00 - Mom: u decide la
30/11/2016, 13:01 - Cindy LEUNG: i'm not even that good at math and econ anyways
30/11/2016, 13:01 - Mom: hahaha
30/11/2016, 13:01 - Cindy LEUNG: yah my actuarial friend got rejected from big 4
30/11/2016, 13:01 - Cindy LEUNG: and he's secured a first hon already.
30/11/2016, 13:01 - Mom: is he graduated this year?
30/11/2016, 13:02 - Cindy LEUNG: no he's third year
30/11/2016, 13:02 - Cindy LEUNG: sounds intense
30/11/2016, 13:03 - Cindy LEUNG: he said they give u feedback as well
30/11/2016, 13:03 - Cindy LEUNG: so he got rejected cuz he wasn't good at public speaking
30/11/2016, 13:03 - Cindy LEUNG: ....
30/11/2016, 13:03 - Cindy LEUNG: wtf.
30/11/2016, 13:04 - Mom: what post he's applying?
30/11/2016, 13:04 - Cindy LEUNG: i have like zero chances then
30/11/2016, 13:04 - Cindy LEUNG: actuary
30/11/2016, 13:04 - Cindy LEUNG: i guess
30/11/2016, 13:04 - Cindy LEUNG: since he does actuarial science
30/11/2016, 13:05 - Cindy LEUNG: he said he applied for actuary positions for the others so im assuming he must have applied for actuary in big 4 too
30/11/2016, 13:05 - Mom: there's no actuarial post in big 4
30/11/2016, 13:05 - Cindy LEUNG: isn't there
30/11/2016, 13:05 - Cindy LEUNG: whoops
30/11/2016, 13:05 - Mom: must be auditing trainee or similar
30/11/2016, 13:06 - Mom: in ur eye, how's ur acturial friend's communication skill?
30/11/2016, 13:06 - Cindy LEUNG: he's not that bad.
30/11/2016, 13:07 - Cindy LEUNG: i think i'm worse
30/11/2016, 13:07 - Cindy LEUNG: but that's cuz i have anxiety issues and lack of confidence in general
30/11/2016, 13:08 - Mom: tbh, how a co select its employee is by luck, no definite mark scheme
30/11/2016, 13:08 - Cindy LEUNG: well i still look like a 17 year old kid
30/11/2016, 13:09 - Cindy LEUNG: i'm not gonna get past interviews
30/11/2016, 13:09 - Cindy LEUNG: and even if i do, who's gonna trust me with their money
30/11/2016, 13:09 - Cindy LEUNG: =.=
30/11/2016, 13:09 - Mom: how many rounds ur actuarial friend passed?
30/11/2016, 13:09 - Cindy LEUNG: he got to assessment centre
30/11/2016, 13:09 - Cindy LEUNG: they only give u feedback if u get to final round
30/11/2016, 13:10 - Mom: ok, so he failed the final round rite?
30/11/2016, 13:10 - Cindy LEUNG: yea i guess
30/11/2016, 13:10 - Cindy LEUNG: most people will fail the assessment centre
30/11/2016, 13:10 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz they only have so many spaces.
30/11/2016, 13:11 - Mom: what is assessment centre?
30/11/2016, 13:11 - Cindy LEUNG: the final round
30/11/2016, 13:11 - Cindy LEUNG: the one where u go and do like several rounds of group interviews and individual interviews
30/11/2016, 13:11 - Mom: ur scared by the real world now
30/11/2016, 13:12 - Cindy LEUNG: he was like, i'm gonna be gone for two day
30/11/2016, 13:12 - Cindy LEUNG: two days to do that
30/11/2016, 13:12 - Cindy LEUNG: more like
30/11/2016, 13:12 - Cindy LEUNG: doubting i can do finance at this point.
30/11/2016, 13:12 - Cindy LEUNG: consulting is still ok
30/11/2016, 13:13 - Cindy LEUNG: but with masters seems to be better
30/11/2016, 13:13 - Cindy LEUNG: so i know my shit
30/11/2016, 13:14 - Mom: i always told u not to think of going into work after first degree, rmb?
30/11/2016, 13:14 - Cindy LEUNG: yea it sounds really hard to go into work with only first degree
30/11/2016, 13:14 - Cindy LEUNG: like a good job
30/11/2016, 13:14 - Mom: i think u need more time to adapt to the business world if ur going to do finance job
30/11/2016, 13:15 - Cindy LEUNG: seems like they just need quants in finance
30/11/2016, 13:15 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz everything in there is numbers numbers and numbers
30/11/2016, 13:15 - Cindy LEUNG: and then sales i guess.
30/11/2016, 13:15 - Mom: btw, u can take this 3 yrs to test ur career orientation
30/11/2016, 13:15 - Cindy LEUNG: with sales u gotta look the part
30/11/2016, 13:16 - Cindy LEUNG: and in general i think its better to be a man
30/11/2016, 13:16 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz u look dependent
30/11/2016, 13:16 - Mom: becoz ur still not sure which way to go
30/11/2016, 13:16 - Cindy LEUNG: especially since its finance
30/11/2016, 13:16 - Cindy LEUNG: i kind of know i wanna do tech related stuff

30/11/2016, 13:21 - Cindy LEUNG: yep
30/11/2016, 13:22 - Mom: being a scientist is so hard, they have to be smart but with less reward
30/11/2016, 13:22 - Cindy LEUNG: yah but i don't think they really care
30/11/2016, 13:22 - Cindy LEUNG: or else they won't be a scientist
30/11/2016, 13:22 - Mom: sure
30/11/2016, 13:23 - Cindy LEUNG: seems like my micro lecturer is more disappointed about the fact that u can't make politicians listen
30/11/2016, 13:23 - Mom: why wud u care abt his feeling?
30/11/2016, 13:23 - Cindy LEUNG: i feel like every lecturer here is like slightly disappointed with sad facts of life here

30/11/2016, 14:20 - Cindy LEUNG: Where I had to jump over obstacles
30/11/2016, 14:20 - Cindy LEUNG: And then I got to the end

02/12/2016, 06:45 - Mom: üòûüòûüòû
02/12/2016, 06:47 - Cindy LEUNG: But srsly my spinal cord seems more sensitive and vulnerable to external stress
02/12/2016, 06:47 - Mom: that
02/12/2016, 06:47 - Mom: that's why i told u to go to nhs for a check
02/12/2016, 06:48 - Mom: u need to ask for a checking of ur spinal cord in uk

02/12/2016, 07:36 - Mom: u said u had srs headache and nerves pain
02/12/2016, 07:36 - Cindy LEUNG: I just hv duvet problems
02/12/2016, 07:36 - Mom: sounds like unbearable
02/12/2016, 07:36 - Cindy LEUNG: This thing is so hot

02/12/2016, 07:39 - Mom: primark's quality is too bad
02/12/2016, 07:39 - Mom: not worth the money
02/12/2016, 07:39 - Mom: invest in money for value thingy
02/12/2016, 07:39 - Cindy LEUNG: Well the clothes r ok
02/12/2016, 07:39 - Mom: errr...
02/12/2016, 07:39 - Cindy LEUNG: Anyway I don't really go to primark now
02/12/2016, 07:40 - Cindy LEUNG: Its so far
02/12/2016, 07:40 - Mom: ok, i'll pick the duvet for u
02/12/2016, 07:40 - Cindy LEUNG: Kk
02/12/2016, 11:47 - Mom: is that a prob if i order the duvet now, which is supposed to arrive ur dorm at the end of next week when u fly back?
02/12/2016, 11:56 - Cindy LEUNG: No reception will just collect it
02/12/2016, 11:59 - Mom: ok
02/12/2016, 11:59 - Mom: is ur present duvet for summer or winter?
02/12/2016, 12:05 - Cindy LEUNG: Winter?
02/12/2016, 12:06 - Cindy LEUNG: Its suitable for Siberia conditions
02/12/2016, 12:06 - Cindy LEUNG: Its that hot
02/12/2016, 12:06 - Mom: wat?
02/12/2016, 12:06 - Mom: 13.5 tog?
02/12/2016, 12:06 - Cindy LEUNG: Yea
02/12/2016, 12:06 - Mom: what's inside ur duvet?
02/12/2016, 12:06 - Cindy LEUNG: Like
02/12/2016, 12:06 - Cindy LEUNG: Polyester I think
02/12/2016, 12:07 - Mom: can u show me the labelling?
02/12/2016, 12:07 - Cindy LEUNG: I hv a fleece blanket and that actually feels better
02/12/2016, 12:07 - Mom: that's wool like rite?
02/12/2016, 12:08 - Mom: i plan to buy a duck feather duvet of 10.5 tog, do u think it still too hot?
02/12/2016, 12:12 - Cindy LEUNG: Ok I solved the mystery
02/12/2016, 12:12 - Cindy LEUNG: Its a 100% polyester
02/12/2016, 12:12 - Cindy LEUNG: 10.5 tog
02/12/2016, 12:13 - Cindy LEUNG: Duck feather isn't good
02/12/2016, 12:13 - Cindy LEUNG: I bought a duck feather pillow and it doesn't puff
02/12/2016, 12:13 - Cindy LEUNG: I need cotton.
02/12/2016, 12:13 - Cindy LEUNG: Or fleece like material
02/12/2016, 12:14 - Cindy LEUNG: I'm really tired today for some reason
02/12/2016, 12:14 - Cindy LEUNG: Like I can't even get uo
02/12/2016, 12:14 - Cindy LEUNG: Up
02/12/2016, 12:29 - Mom: there must be some filling material into the duvet
02/12/2016, 12:30 - Mom: it used to be polyester, or goose down or duck feather
02/12/2016, 12:31 - Mom: there's no cotton fillings now
02/12/2016, 12:32 - Mom: or u can buy a fleece like blanket, but i wonder if it's warm enough in cold weather
02/12/2016, 12:32 - Mom: and i don't recommend wool cuz u might feel itchy
02/12/2016, 12:33 - Mom: can't get up?
02/12/2016, 12:33 - Mom: u had been sleeping very long time today?
02/12/2016, 12:33 - Mom: what time u went to bed yesterday?
02/12/2016, 12:34 - Mom: u shudn't use duck feather pillow as u can see it isn't puff, but for duvet they're warm and lightweight
02/12/2016, 12:35 - Mom: and duck feather duvet is breathable, allow heat to pass through ur body to prevent overheated
02/12/2016, 12:36 - Mom: or u can buy cashmere blanket, warm and comfy but very expensive like 200+ pounds
02/12/2016, 12:39 - Mom: polyester duvet is non-breathable, so u feel hot having stayed in ur bedding for long time
02/12/2016, 12:48 - Mom: if u want cotton duvet, u can just buy a cotton duvet cover
02/12/2016, 12:50 - Cindy LEUNG: Right
02/12/2016, 12:50 - Cindy LEUNG: I see
02/12/2016, 12:50 - Cindy LEUNG: Go with duck feather then
02/12/2016, 12:50 - Mom: so now, what do u prefer?
02/12/2016, 12:50 - Mom: kkk
02/12/2016, 12:51 - Cindy LEUNG: Df
02/12/2016, 13:00 - Cindy LEUNG: Ok I had a n√†p
02/12/2016, 13:01 - Cindy LEUNG: And a dream ofc
02/12/2016, 13:03 - Mom: dream content?
02/12/2016, 13:04 - Cindy LEUNG: so i was in my room
02/12/2016, 13:04 - Cindy LEUNG: and u were sitting at the desk in front of a large screen mac desktop
02/12/2016, 13:04 - Cindy LEUNG: and then we were watching tv
02/12/2016, 13:04 - Cindy LEUNG: on the mac
02/12/2016, 13:04 - Cindy LEUNG: forgot the tv program
02/12/2016, 13:04 - Cindy LEUNG: and at the point i think i actually spoke out loud
02/12/2016, 13:05 - Cindy LEUNG: can't remember what it was those, a phrase
02/12/2016, 13:05 - Cindy LEUNG: phrase
02/12/2016, 13:05 - Mom: it was me watching tv with u inside ur room?
02/12/2016, 13:05 - Cindy LEUNG: and then there was no response
02/12/2016, 13:05 - Cindy LEUNG: yes
02/12/2016, 13:05 - Cindy LEUNG: maybe emos
02/12/2016, 13:05 - Cindy LEUNG: can't remember
02/12/2016, 13:05 - Cindy LEUNG: and then i realise that i was dreaming
02/12/2016, 13:05 - Cindy LEUNG: and you guys aren't actually there
02/12/2016, 13:06 - Cindy LEUNG: so i go back to sleep, cuz i'm sleepy
02/12/2016, 13:06 - Cindy LEUNG: and then u're still there watching tv
02/12/2016, 13:06 - Cindy LEUNG: this time
02/12/2016, 13:06 - Cindy LEUNG: my body just moves around the room
02/12/2016, 13:06 - Cindy LEUNG: through the walls and objects
02/12/2016, 13:06 - Cindy LEUNG: and i can feel them go through my body
02/12/2016, 13:07 - Cindy LEUNG: it was fps
02/12/2016, 13:07 - Mom: u mean the walls and objects go through ur body? like ur soul coming out of ur body?
02/12/2016, 13:07 - Cindy LEUNG: like sitting in a car on ocen par ride
02/12/2016, 13:07 - Cindy LEUNG: no like i can move through walls
02/12/2016, 13:08 - Cindy LEUNG: but i could feel something when i moved through a wall
02/12/2016, 13:08 - Cindy LEUNG: and then i sort of glide around the room see= searching for a thesis title.
02/12/2016, 13:09 - Cindy LEUNG: and there there is this point where i keep going through walls
02/12/2016, 13:09 - Cindy LEUNG: like an infinitely repeating cycle
02/12/2016, 13:09 - Mom: always going through walls?
02/12/2016, 13:09 - Cindy LEUNG: the people had disappeared already by this point
02/12/2016, 13:09 - Cindy LEUNG: and then
02/12/2016, 13:10 - Cindy LEUNG: i finally stopped at final destination
02/12/2016, 13:10 - Cindy LEUNG: and that is my desktop
02/12/2016, 13:10 - Cindy LEUNG: in real life
02/12/2016, 13:10 - Cindy LEUNG: and then the dream ended
02/12/2016, 13:10 - Mom: where's the final destination?
02/12/2016, 13:10 - Cindy LEUNG: i opened my eues
02/12/2016, 13:10 - Mom: funny dreams

02/12/2016, 16:11 - Cindy LEUNG: But then I walk out into the cold again, I get fever
02/12/2016, 16:11 - Mom: looks like virus infection
02/12/2016, 16:11 - Cindy LEUNG: Viral is ok
02/12/2016, 16:12 - Mom: 37.16 C, not exactly fever if hot weather
02/12/2016, 16:12 - Cindy LEUNG: It goes away by itself
02/12/2016, 16:12 - Cindy LEUNG: Now it's 101
02/12/2016, 16:12 - Cindy LEUNG: But might be shot watwry
02/12/2016, 16:12 - Mom: but it's the viral infection that affect ppl's nervous system
02/12/2016, 16:12 - Cindy LEUNG: Water
02/12/2016, 16:12 - Cindy LEUNG: It says on NHS site that viral infection they don't do anything
02/12/2016, 16:12 - Mom: 101 def low grade fever
02/12/2016, 16:13 - Cindy LEUNG: Only bacterial they worry abt
02/12/2016, 16:13 - Mom: yea, viral infection don't have meds
02/12/2016, 16:13 - Mom: even viral infection for meningitis, they won't give any med

02/12/2016, 16:13 - Cindy LEUNG: They hv super bugs there
02/12/2016, 16:14 - Cindy LEUNG: And then I hv lowered immune
02/12/2016, 16:14 - Mom: check ur temp every 2-4 hrs, and drink more water
02/12/2016, 16:14 - Mom: take ibuprofen and get rest
02/12/2016, 16:14 - Mom: even sleep all day, no way
02/12/2016, 16:15 - Cindy LEUNG: I feel like they'll tell me to do the same things
02/12/2016, 16:15 - Cindy LEUNG: But I'll go see gp on monday
02/12/2016, 16:15 - Cindy LEUNG: If i can
02/12/2016, 16:15 - Mom: those ivig gave u additional antibodies which isn't in ur immune system before, so u'll react more to the viral infection
02/12/2016, 16:15 - Cindy LEUNG: I could barely wall to starbucks
02/12/2016, 16:16 - Mom: do u have enough food in ur dorm?

02/12/2016, 16:19 - Mom: rmb to check ur temp when ur awake
02/12/2016, 16:19 - Mom: make sure not having very high fever and causing unconscious

02/12/2016, 16:19 - Mom: if feel rlly not well, just head to a&e
02/12/2016, 16:19 - Cindy LEUNG: Its affecting my heart as well

02/12/2016, 16:20 - Cindy LEUNG: Panga
02/12/2016, 16:20 - Cindy LEUNG: Pangs
02/12/2016, 16:20 - Mom: still pain now?
02/12/2016, 16:20 - Cindy LEUNG: And also dizziness
02/12/2016, 16:21 - Mom: that's sudden change of BP,  i guess
02/12/2016, 16:21 - Cindy LEUNG: Like I would suddenly feel diZZY  and get doublee vision
02/12/2016, 16:21 - Mom: these r result of blood flow, i guess
02/12/2016, 16:21 - Mom: that's why drs cudn't check out any abnormalities on ur test report
02/12/2016, 16:22 - Cindy LEUNG: If i go to a&e, I tell them the whole story
02/12/2016, 16:22 - Mom: becoz symptoms appeared just as a result of blood flow inside ur body
02/12/2016, 16:22 - Cindy LEUNG: Let them decide narco or not
02/12/2016, 16:22 - Mom: narco and cataplexy?
02/12/2016, 16:23 - Cindy LEUNG: Just I rebooked at all the neurological diseases an they r all the sane symptoms
02/12/2016, 16:23 - Mom: what if they require u to provide hospitalisation test results?
02/12/2016, 16:40 - Mom: go take a shower
02/12/2016, 17:06 - Mom: hi
02/12/2016, 17:06 - Mom: finish ur shower?

02/12/2016, 17:44 - Mom: hi
02/12/2016, 17:45 - Mom: no more crying?
02/12/2016, 18:49 - Mom: hello, r u there?
02/12/2016, 19:37 - Cindy LEUNG: O went to sleep
02/12/2016, 19:38 - Mom: Still pain?
02/12/2016, 19:38 - Cindy LEUNG: No I don't normally get the pain anyways
02/12/2016, 19:38 - Cindy LEUNG: The fever went down
02/12/2016, 19:38 - Mom: So many weird stuff
02/12/2016, 19:39 - Mom: No fever now?
02/12/2016, 19:39 - Cindy LEUNG: Now I think I have narcolepsy
02/12/2016, 19:40 - Cindy LEUNG: i experienced a few things which reconfirm this.
02/12/2016, 19:40 - Mom: Wat?
02/12/2016, 19:40 - Cindy LEUNG: like when i was out in the cold
02/12/2016, 19:40 - Cindy LEUNG: i had pangs of dizziness
02/12/2016, 19:41 - Cindy LEUNG: i felt dizzy in my head
02/12/2016, 19:41 - Cindy LEUNG: and then my eyeballs went out of control
02/12/2016, 19:41 - Cindy LEUNG: and my vision was messed up briefly
02/12/2016, 19:42 - Cindy LEUNG: so they were very short sessions
02/12/2016, 19:42 - Cindy LEUNG: like < 1 second
02/12/2016, 19:42 - Mom: Did u have feeling of falling ?
02/12/2016, 19:42 - Cindy LEUNG: not yet.
02/12/2016, 19:42 - Cindy LEUNG: but if longer, i would
02/12/2016, 19:42 - Cindy LEUNG: i think we've been mistaking that as leg weakness
02/12/2016, 19:42 - Cindy LEUNG: at least i have
02/12/2016, 19:43 - Cindy LEUNG: after meals, i have dizziness
02/12/2016, 19:43 - Cindy LEUNG: in my head
02/12/2016, 19:43 - Cindy LEUNG: legs don't go weak
02/12/2016, 19:43 - Mom: So u think that is sleep attack?
02/12/2016, 19:43 - Cindy LEUNG: hmm....
02/12/2016, 19:43 - Cindy LEUNG: idk
02/12/2016, 19:43 - Cindy LEUNG: there's no relation yet
02/12/2016, 19:44 - Cindy LEUNG: but now we know
02/12/2016, 19:44 - Cindy LEUNG: not a seizure
02/12/2016, 19:44 - Cindy LEUNG: and caused by stimulation of nerves
02/12/2016, 19:44 - Cindy LEUNG: and that's different from when i react to something funny
02/12/2016, 19:44 - Cindy LEUNG: when i react to something funny, i actually fall pretty fast
02/12/2016, 19:44 - Mom: Dont bother that disorder name, wat matters r the symptoms which make u sick
02/12/2016, 19:45 - Cindy LEUNG: yes but i should check my orexins
02/12/2016, 19:45 - Cindy LEUNG: but it seems to me that
02/12/2016, 19:46 - Cindy LEUNG: i may actually have cataplexy
02/12/2016, 19:46 - Cindy LEUNG: and teh dizziness post meals
02/12/2016, 19:46 - Cindy LEUNG: the dizziness also occur randomly, which would explain why i think i get brief moments of mild cataplexy which i can control
02/12/2016, 19:47 - Cindy LEUNG: so this is moving from one space to another, going down stairs
02/12/2016, 19:47 - Cindy LEUNG: etc.
02/12/2016, 19:47 - Cindy LEUNG: also i only got this symptoms AFTER the ivig trial
02/12/2016, 19:48 - Cindy LEUNG: which suggests the ivig could have possibly introduced that symptom
02/12/2016, 19:48 - Mom: Omg
02/12/2016, 19:48 - Cindy LEUNG: yah
02/12/2016, 19:48 - Cindy LEUNG: so what has happened is that
02/12/2016, 19:48 - Cindy LEUNG: dizziness is very similar to loss of muscle tone
02/12/2016, 19:49 - Cindy LEUNG: so it has been clouding the n+C data
02/12/2016, 19:49 - Cindy LEUNG: to be fair i onnly describe muscle weakness to the doctors, so they think narcoCataplexy is very reasonable
02/12/2016, 19:50 - Cindy LEUNG: but i think not to take anti-depressants is right, cuz evidently that would have messed up my hormones during second puberty
02/12/2016, 19:51 - Mom: I actually regret taking that ivig for u
02/12/2016, 19:51 - Cindy LEUNG: well we all do don't we
02/12/2016, 19:52 - Mom: If i insist not, will u hate me
02/12/2016, 19:52 - Cindy LEUNG: past has happened already anyways
02/12/2016, 19:53 - Cindy LEUNG: so what do we do now
02/12/2016, 19:53 - Cindy LEUNG: it looks like my immune system has gone weird as well
02/12/2016, 19:54 - Cindy LEUNG: those canadians use those ivig stuff right?
02/12/2016, 19:54 - Mom: Tbh, idk
02/12/2016, 19:54 - Cindy LEUNG: its so expensive i don't think nhs even has the money to do these trials
02/12/2016, 19:54 - Mom: Yea, canadians use lot of ivig
02/12/2016, 19:54 - Cindy LEUNG: so they know nothing about it
02/12/2016, 19:55 - Cindy LEUNG: i just wonder if my eye problems are due to narco or teh dizziness
02/12/2016, 19:55 - Mom: Now, it looks ivig's bad outweighs its good
02/12/2016, 19:55 - Cindy LEUNG: well thank god we only did two trials
02/12/2016, 19:56 - Cindy LEUNG: anyways
02/12/2016, 19:56 - Cindy LEUNG: i also think narco is pretty plausible
02/12/2016, 19:56 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz now i know exactly what happened two years ago
02/12/2016, 19:56 - Mom: This is the point cuz i never read from forum that ppl having narco has this eye prob
02/12/2016, 19:57 - Cindy LEUNG: possibly side effect of ivig
02/12/2016, 19:57 - Cindy LEUNG: or effect of irregular sleep
02/12/2016, 19:57 - Cindy LEUNG: i developed fucking migraines which are supposed to be genetic
02/12/2016, 19:57 - Cindy LEUNG: i think thats due to irregular sleep
02/12/2016, 19:58 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz their occurences are correlated with when im supposed to sleep
02/12/2016, 19:58 - Cindy LEUNG: but eye pain that stuff. i had those quite early on
02/12/2016, 19:58 - Mom: If side effect of irregular sleep, other ppl suffering from sleep disorder might have same prob as well
02/12/2016, 19:58 - Cindy LEUNG: yeah lots of people have migraine
02/12/2016, 19:59 - Cindy LEUNG: but medical consensus is that its genetic or idiopathic
02/12/2016, 19:59 - Cindy LEUNG: so that could be a research paper
02/12/2016, 20:00 - Mom: I wud rather think ur migraine is a result of irregular sleep
02/12/2016, 20:00 - Cindy LEUNG: yea exactly that's what i said
02/12/2016, 20:00 - Cindy LEUNG: but the eye pain possibly not
02/12/2016, 20:00 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz i had that right eye which would water a lot
02/12/2016, 20:00 - Cindy LEUNG: though i had that before going into hospital as well...
02/12/2016, 20:00 - Mom: How's ur nerve pain now
02/12/2016, 20:01 - Cindy LEUNG: subside
02/12/2016, 20:01 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz i took panadol and ibuprofen
02/12/2016, 20:01 - Mom: And the pain at ur hands and feet?
02/12/2016, 20:01 - Mom: Both?
02/12/2016, 20:01 - Cindy LEUNG: none
02/12/2016, 20:01 - Cindy LEUNG: yea u have to take both
02/12/2016, 20:01 - Cindy LEUNG: or else it doesn't work
02/12/2016, 20:02 - Mom: No, they r both painkiller
02/12/2016, 20:02 - Cindy LEUNG: no ibuprofen lower the fever
02/12/2016, 20:02 - Mom: If u took both, u just double the med
02/12/2016, 20:02 - Cindy LEUNG: that's what i did last time
02/12/2016, 20:03 - Mom: Yea, ibuprofen treats inflammatiom as well
02/12/2016, 20:03 - Cindy LEUNG: actually last time i got fever was due to nerves as well
02/12/2016, 20:03 - Mom: When last time?
02/12/2016, 20:03 - Cindy LEUNG: i had spinal pain i vaguely remember
02/12/2016, 20:03 - Cindy LEUNG: in june before i left
02/12/2016, 20:03 - Mom: Last yr at christmas?
02/12/2016, 20:03 - Cindy LEUNG: everytime i leave i get fever
02/12/2016, 20:03 - Cindy LEUNG: no
02/12/2016, 20:04 - Mom: Emotional stress?
02/12/2016, 20:04 - Cindy LEUNG: no
02/12/2016, 20:04 - Cindy LEUNG: i vaguely remember i had spinal pain again
02/12/2016, 20:05 - Cindy LEUNG: its external stimulus cause nerve to be inflamed
02/12/2016, 20:05 - Cindy LEUNG: like mild menigitis
02/12/2016, 20:05 - Cindy LEUNG: meningitis
02/12/2016, 20:05 - Mom: U mean june?
02/12/2016, 20:06 - Cindy LEUNG: yes talking abt jun
02/12/2016, 20:06 - Cindy LEUNG: just like this time
02/12/2016, 20:06 - Cindy LEUNG: well except i didn't have the stiffening of the jaw
02/12/2016, 20:06 - Cindy LEUNG: and i didn't do some many weird stuff in my sleep
02/12/2016, 20:07 - Cindy LEUNG: just now i was hyperventilating in my sleep
02/12/2016, 20:08 - Mom: That's why when u took antibiotics, ur sleep symptoms improved
02/12/2016, 20:08 - Cindy LEUNG: hmm we actually only clearly saw that with the fever i had last christmas
02/12/2016, 20:08 - Cindy LEUNG: so i should check for meningitis
02/12/2016, 20:09 - Cindy LEUNG: and they'll know i didn't do the vaccination
02/12/2016, 20:09 - Mom: Ehy chk for meningitis?
02/12/2016, 20:09 - Mom: Why
02/12/2016, 20:09 - Cindy LEUNG: spinal tap
02/12/2016, 20:09 - Cindy LEUNG: see if u have bacterial in ur spinal fluid
02/12/2016, 20:09 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz they'll ask me
02/12/2016, 20:10 - Cindy LEUNG: when's the date of your last meningitis vaccination
02/12/2016, 20:10 - Cindy LEUNG: and then i'll have to say i didn't do it
02/12/2016, 20:10 - Cindy LEUNG: and then htey'll be like why did you do it
02/12/2016, 20:10 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz....
02/12/2016, 20:10 - Mom: If u had bacteria, u prob had developed a real meningitis already
02/12/2016, 20:10 - Cindy LEUNG: thats true
02/12/2016, 20:10 - Cindy LEUNG: probably not e.coli or that nasty stuff
02/12/2016, 20:11 - Mom: Dont do meningitis injection now
02/12/2016, 20:11 - Cindy LEUNG: would it be possible i have a weak bacteria in there though?
02/12/2016, 20:11 - Cindy LEUNG: i did go into hospital
02/12/2016, 20:11 - Cindy LEUNG: who knows whats there
02/12/2016, 20:11 - Mom: Not possible
02/12/2016, 20:11 - Cindy LEUNG: ok so probably viral
02/12/2016, 20:12 - Cindy LEUNG: moving on second q
02/12/2016, 20:12 - Cindy LEUNG: the worst symptoms only come out during sleep
02/12/2016, 20:13 - Mom: bacteria won't stay long and do nothing harm to ur body
02/12/2016, 20:13 - Cindy LEUNG: true
02/12/2016, 20:13 - Cindy LEUNG: why did i get jaw stiffness?
02/12/2016, 20:13 - Mom: if u displayed meningitis symptoms, that must be viral
02/12/2016, 20:14 - Mom: cuz our body has plenty of virus living there
02/12/2016, 20:14 - Cindy LEUNG: ok
02/12/2016, 20:14 - Cindy LEUNG: then that means, the ivig affected the cns immune system
02/12/2016, 20:14 - Mom: i am now still unclear whether it's the nerve near ur jaw painful or the muscle?
02/12/2016, 20:14 - Mom: i think so
02/12/2016, 20:14 - Cindy LEUNG: the jaw locked in fixed position
02/12/2016, 20:15 - Cindy LEUNG: i couldn't move it at all
02/12/2016, 20:15 - Cindy LEUNG: and it was painful
02/12/2016, 20:15 - Cindy LEUNG: and two years ago
02/12/2016, 20:15 - Cindy LEUNG: i tried to bite together everytime that happened
02/12/2016, 20:15 - Mom: but ur jaw stiffness didn't appear at the time when u were awake rite?
02/12/2016, 20:15 - Cindy LEUNG: no
02/12/2016, 20:15 - Cindy LEUNG: its always
02/12/2016, 20:15 - Cindy LEUNG: just before wake up
02/12/2016, 20:16 - Cindy LEUNG: i suspect everything happened in rem as well
02/12/2016, 20:16 - Mom: so it's actual pain or dream?
02/12/2016, 20:16 - Cindy LEUNG: real fucking pain
02/12/2016, 20:16 - Cindy LEUNG: pain is always real
02/12/2016, 20:16 - Mom: but why when u woke up, everything gone?
02/12/2016, 20:17 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz the brain immunity linked with sleep?
02/12/2016, 20:17 - Cindy LEUNG: like u said, maybe lowered immunity in rem?
02/12/2016, 20:17 - Mom: u know pain is very difficult to demonstrate to those dr and convince them
02/12/2016, 20:17 - Cindy LEUNG: well yah
02/12/2016, 20:17 - Cindy LEUNG: but i couldn't move my jaw
02/12/2016, 20:18 - Cindy LEUNG: now i think about it
02/12/2016, 20:18 - Cindy LEUNG: it could be muscle.
02/12/2016, 20:18 - Mom: whenever u see the dr, u can move ur jaw, then those drs wudn't bother
02/12/2016, 20:18 - Mom: this is the main prob
02/12/2016, 20:18 - Cindy LEUNG: but then there wouldn't be the feeling like it was 'locked' into place
02/12/2016, 20:19 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz my jaw was open as well
02/12/2016, 20:19 - Cindy LEUNG: if my mouth was closed the ambiguity would be bigger.
02/12/2016, 20:20 - Mom: how often do u have ur jaw locked?
02/12/2016, 20:20 - Mom: during sleep
02/12/2016, 20:21 - Cindy LEUNG: when?
02/12/2016, 20:21 - Cindy LEUNG: just now was the first time i experienced it for a long time (i.e. since two years ago)
02/12/2016, 20:21 - Mom: in a year?
02/12/2016, 20:21 - Cindy LEUNG: i only had jaw pain in the summer of yr 13
02/12/2016, 20:22 - Mom: locked at that time as well?
02/12/2016, 20:22 - Cindy LEUNG: and when i'm sleeping i can't think properly so i couldn't describe what it was
02/12/2016, 20:22 - Cindy LEUNG: the pain is the same
02/12/2016, 20:22 - Cindy LEUNG: so i'm assuming this is the same phenomena
02/12/2016, 20:22 - Mom: kk
02/12/2016, 20:22 - Cindy LEUNG: i think i also had it once more between 2 years ago and now
02/12/2016, 20:22 - Cindy LEUNG: but i can't remember when
02/12/2016, 20:23 - Cindy LEUNG: it was like a one off thing
02/12/2016, 20:24 - Cindy LEUNG: so i basically believe that its my vagus nerve which was over-stimulated this time
02/12/2016, 20:24 - Cindy LEUNG: by the cold through the ear
02/12/2016, 20:24 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz i bought ear phones
02/12/2016, 20:25 - Cindy LEUNG: so i stopped using the over ear headphones
02/12/2016, 20:25 - Cindy LEUNG: the ear is thus exposed to the cold.
02/12/2016, 20:25 - Mom: did u cover ur ear with the hat of ur coat?
02/12/2016, 20:25 - Cindy LEUNG: no
02/12/2016, 20:25 - Mom: u shud
02/12/2016, 20:25 - Cindy LEUNG: yea i should
02/12/2016, 20:26 - Mom: even if u wear earphones, u shud still cover ur ear with the hat
02/12/2016, 20:26 - Cindy LEUNG: and i switched only because i didn't want to get run over by a car
02/12/2016, 20:26 - Mom: always buy warm coat with hat
02/12/2016, 20:27 - Cindy LEUNG: sigh
02/12/2016, 20:27 - Cindy LEUNG: im stumped
02/12/2016, 20:27 - Mom: how many days did u have this headache or fever?
02/12/2016, 20:28 - Cindy LEUNG: since thursday
02/12/2016, 20:28 - Cindy LEUNG: the fever came really quickly.
02/12/2016, 20:28 - Mom: 2 days only?
02/12/2016, 20:28 - Cindy LEUNG: which is what i've been repeating but i'm not sure what u think about that
02/12/2016, 20:28 - Cindy LEUNG: i might have had slight headache on wednesday
02/12/2016, 20:28 - Mom: does ur fever come on and off?
02/12/2016, 20:29 - Cindy LEUNG: ....
02/12/2016, 20:29 - Mom: throughout like a week or 2
02/12/2016, 20:29 - Cindy LEUNG: actually no
02/12/2016, 20:29 - Cindy LEUNG: definitely just thursday
02/12/2016, 20:29 - Cindy LEUNG: no
02/12/2016, 20:29 - Cindy LEUNG: what do you mean?
02/12/2016, 20:29 - Cindy LEUNG: i first had fever in costa thursday night
02/12/2016, 20:30 - Mom: if fever comes on and off, that's probably a viral infection inside ur body right now
02/12/2016, 20:30 - Cindy LEUNG: and then that went down by itself in 2 hrs
02/12/2016, 20:30 - Cindy LEUNG: and then i just had a fever again, but i think it went away cuz of the meds or sleep
02/12/2016, 20:31 - Cindy LEUNG: i have constant headache though
02/12/2016, 20:31 - Mom: if fever or headache starts only a few days, it probably is flu
02/12/2016, 20:31 - Cindy LEUNG: its always here
02/12/2016, 20:31 - Cindy LEUNG: no but i have spinal pain
02/12/2016, 20:31 - Mom: not muscles pain?
02/12/2016, 20:32 - Cindy LEUNG: and just now the cold induced those cns inflammation symptoms
02/12/2016, 20:32 - Cindy LEUNG: which appeared with teh fever
02/12/2016, 20:32 - Cindy LEUNG: so lets say i do have flu
02/12/2016, 20:32 - Cindy LEUNG: its affecting my cns
02/12/2016, 20:32 - Cindy LEUNG: not muscle pain def
02/12/2016, 20:33 - Cindy LEUNG: its nervous pain
02/12/2016, 20:33 - Cindy LEUNG: it comes and go
02/12/2016, 20:33 - Cindy LEUNG: and u get 'pangs' of it
02/12/2016, 20:33 - Mom: go to nhs ask if this is normal for a flu
02/12/2016, 20:34 - Cindy LEUNG: yea sure
02/12/2016, 20:34 - Mom: bear in mind, not to do any vaccine injection at the moment
02/12/2016, 20:34 - Cindy LEUNG: actually if i go they will definitely ask me about the meningitis vaccine
02/12/2016, 20:35 - Mom: just say no no no
02/12/2016, 20:35 - Cindy LEUNG: ....
02/12/2016, 20:35 - Cindy LEUNG: i don't wnat them to ask me
02/12/2016, 20:35 - Mom: tell them u can't rmb
02/12/2016, 20:36 - Cindy LEUNG: ....
02/12/2016, 20:36 - Cindy LEUNG: also
02/12/2016, 20:36 - Cindy LEUNG: i have a rash on my abdomen
02/12/2016, 20:40 - Mom: the one u show me before?
02/12/2016, 20:40 - Cindy LEUNG: yea
02/12/2016, 20:40 - Mom: gone?
02/12/2016, 20:41 - Mom: rashes + fever --> looks like having viral infection ?
02/12/2016, 20:42 - Cindy LEUNG: rash + fever == nerve inflammation
02/12/2016, 20:42 - Cindy LEUNG: meningitis has a rash
02/12/2016, 20:42 - Mom: i have to check
02/12/2016, 20:43 - Mom: if meningitis, still that's viral
02/12/2016, 20:43 - Mom: if bacteria, u shud be in hospital now
02/12/2016, 20:47 - Cindy LEUNG: its not
02/12/2016, 20:47 - Cindy LEUNG: but meningitis can be viral
02/12/2016, 20:48 - Mom: sure
02/12/2016, 20:48 - Cindy LEUNG: im not sure if the rash blanches or not
02/12/2016, 20:48 - Cindy LEUNG: i can see the scars.
02/12/2016, 20:48 - Cindy LEUNG: i think the rash more related to the hormone changes like two weeks ago
02/12/2016, 20:48 - Mom: https://www.meningitisnow.org/meningitis-explained/signs-and-symptoms/signs-and-symptoms-children-and-adults/
02/12/2016, 20:49 - Mom: check the meningitis symptoms
02/12/2016, 20:50 - Mom: new meningitis vaccine is not compulsory
02/12/2016, 20:51 - Mom: my advice now is not to take in any unnecessay vaccine, not to complicate ur already messed up immune system
02/12/2016, 20:51 - Mom: did u eat anything for today?
02/12/2016, 20:52 - Cindy LEUNG: yea i'm eating chicken katsu curry atm
02/12/2016, 20:53 - Cindy LEUNG: i know they made students get the meningitis vaccines a couple of years back cuz a lot of them had it
02/12/2016, 20:53 - Cindy LEUNG: but that was due to hygiene problems
02/12/2016, 20:53 - Mom: first yr uni students
02/12/2016, 20:53 - Cindy LEUNG: ok
02/12/2016, 20:53 - Cindy LEUNG: if anyone is to get meningitis in my flat, i think the bj girl should get it first
02/12/2016, 20:53 - Mom: they replace the old vaccine with a new vaccine type
02/12/2016, 20:54 - Mom: she's first yr?
02/12/2016, 20:54 - Cindy LEUNG: shes fucking dirty
02/12/2016, 20:54 - Mom: omg
02/12/2016, 20:54 - Mom: ur rite
02/12/2016, 20:54 - Cindy LEUNG: but i don't share bathroom with her anymore
02/12/2016, 20:54 - Cindy LEUNG: so
02/12/2016, 20:54 - Mom: reality isn't always fair
02/12/2016, 20:55 - Mom: or used to be unfair, i guess
02/12/2016, 20:55 - Cindy LEUNG: dude i don't want to share a bathroom with her
02/12/2016, 20:55 - Mom: ofc, why share with her, she's so dirty as u said
02/12/2016, 20:56 - Mom: how can i bj girl behave like this?
02/12/2016, 20:56 - Mom: is bj the capital of "great china"?
02/12/2016, 20:56 - Cindy LEUNG: erm why not?
02/12/2016, 20:56 - Cindy LEUNG: bathroom is public good
02/12/2016, 20:57 - Cindy LEUNG: this is just tragedy of commons problem
02/12/2016, 20:57 - Mom: chinese r always a mystery
02/12/2016, 20:57 - Mom: üòûüòû
02/12/2016, 20:57 - Cindy LEUNG: its economic problem
02/12/2016, 20:58 - Mom: those chinese r exporting out hygiene problems to the civilized world
02/12/2016, 20:58 - Mom: so selfish
02/12/2016, 20:58 - Cindy LEUNG: i think the meningitis scare a few years back wasn't chinese exported
02/12/2016, 20:58 - Cindy LEUNG: but whatever
02/12/2016, 20:58 - Cindy LEUNG: lets move on

03/12/2016, 10:41 - Cindy LEUNG: i kind of understand it only
03/12/2016, 10:46 - Mom: it said credit suisse laid off traders in london office,
03/12/2016, 10:46 - Cindy LEUNG: no it says there this guy called tim middleton
03/12/2016, 10:46 - Mom: a trader who had worked in credit suisse before left the co and changes its career to a boat rower
03/12/2016, 10:47 - Cindy LEUNG: and he's got phd in chem from cambriddge
03/12/2016, 10:47 - Mom: yea, that's tim middleton who had worked in credit suisse london
03/12/2016, 10:47 - Mom: yea
03/12/2016, 10:47 - Cindy LEUNG: i don't think he became a rower cuz he was laid off tbh
03/12/2016, 10:48 - Mom: but he left in oct already
03/12/2016, 10:49 - Mom: anyway, finance industry looks bad
03/12/2016, 10:50 - Cindy LEUNG: but that's short run
03/12/2016, 10:50 - Mom: credit suisse hk also is said to layoff ppl
03/12/2016, 10:50 - Mom: sure
03/12/2016, 10:50 - Cindy LEUNG: i was looking at internship again the other other day
03/12/2016, 10:50 - Cindy LEUNG: now i know a bit about finance
03/12/2016, 10:50 - Mom: but ppl need to have reserve for the spring to come
03/12/2016, 10:50 - Cindy LEUNG: so i looked at what programs they have
03/12/2016, 10:50 - Mom: fin tech, i guess is more secure
03/12/2016, 10:51 - Cindy LEUNG: i saw strategy
03/12/2016, 10:51 - Cindy LEUNG: lol
03/12/2016, 10:51 - Cindy LEUNG: that sounds interesting
03/12/2016, 10:51 - Cindy LEUNG: need phd
03/12/2016, 10:51 - Cindy LEUNG: :(
03/12/2016, 10:51 - Mom: that's consulting?
03/12/2016, 10:51 - Cindy LEUNG: but they were taking phds as interns
03/12/2016, 10:51 - Mom: it looks a first deg is definite not enough to secure a job in normal industry
03/12/2016, 10:52 - Mom: unless u work in Starbucks
03/12/2016, 10:53 - Mom: cause supply > demand
03/12/2016, 10:53 - Cindy LEUNG: well i'm not gonna waste my time going through four rounds of application to get a glorified sales job
03/12/2016, 10:53 - Mom: co picks the best
03/12/2016, 10:53 - Mom: hahaha
03/12/2016, 10:53 - Cindy LEUNG: and if they competition is this bad, it just means that is not a skilled job
03/12/2016, 10:53 - Mom: hmm
03/12/2016, 10:54 - Mom: the truth is more ppl get more education nowadays
03/12/2016, 10:55 - Cindy LEUNG: but u don't really need skills to be a trader...
03/12/2016, 10:55 - Cindy LEUNG: or u don't really need skills u learn at a uni
03/12/2016, 10:55 - Cindy LEUNG: its more of a vocational job.
03/12/2016, 10:55 - Cindy LEUNG: imo
03/12/2016, 10:56 - Mom: right, but company need staff's qualifications to boost up images
03/12/2016, 10:56 - Mom: that's why they prefer applicants having advance degreee
03/12/2016, 10:56 - Cindy LEUNG: cool
03/12/2016, 10:57 - Mom: that qualification is used to comfort potential clients that they r trustworthy
03/12/2016, 10:57 - Cindy LEUNG: thats why u need a first degree to be an air stewardess in korea these days
03/12/2016, 10:57 - Mom: sure
03/12/2016, 10:57 - Mom: exactly
03/12/2016, 10:58 - Mom: first deg now is just like a primary skl certificate
03/12/2016, 10:58 - Mom: sad but true
03/12/2016, 10:58 - Cindy LEUNG: in germany unemployment is not as bad because they don't stigmatize vocational training
03/12/2016, 10:58 - Mom: they have other ways to train vocational ppl
03/12/2016, 10:58 - Cindy LEUNG: u can go learn how to make pencils and nobody will say u're a loser
03/12/2016, 10:59 - Mom: this is not applicable to hk or korea or uk?
03/12/2016, 10:59 - Cindy LEUNG: no in hk if u're not a doctor or lawyer u're a loser
03/12/2016, 11:00 - Mom: sad but very tru
03/12/2016, 11:00 - Mom: how's ur headache and nerve pain now?
03/12/2016, 11:00 - Cindy LEUNG: but living standards are lower in germany
03/12/2016, 11:00 - Cindy LEUNG: gone
03/12/2016, 11:00 - Mom: still have fever?
03/12/2016, 11:00 - Cindy LEUNG: no
03/12/2016, 11:00 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz i took m eds
03/12/2016, 11:00 - Mom: lower? in what aspect?
03/12/2016, 11:01 - Cindy LEUNG: rent is so much cheaper
03/12/2016, 11:01 - Cindy LEUNG: even in berlin
03/12/2016, 11:01 - Cindy LEUNG: german is worth learning üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª
03/12/2016, 11:01 - Cindy LEUNG: but u have to battle with the refugee in future
03/12/2016, 11:01 - Cindy LEUNG: so u need phds
03/12/2016, 11:01 - Mom: rent lower becoz ppl earn a lot less rite
03/12/2016, 11:02 - Mom: and germany has a lot of immigrants
03/12/2016, 11:02 - Mom: like 1 million
03/12/2016, 11:02 - Mom: ppl find jobs even harder
03/12/2016, 11:02 - Mom: refugee don't have phds rite
03/12/2016, 11:03 - Cindy LEUNG: welll
03/12/2016, 11:04 - Cindy LEUNG: fair enough
03/12/2016, 11:04 - Cindy LEUNG: europe is in crisis
03/12/2016, 11:04 - Mom: A big crisis becoz of the refugees
03/12/2016, 11:05 - Cindy LEUNG: even the economist agree that the global climate is very like post-ww1, leading up to ww2
03/12/2016, 11:05 - Mom: Omg
03/12/2016, 11:05 - Mom: I shud convert all my moneybinto gold?
03/12/2016, 11:05 - Cindy LEUNG: yes i called it first
03/12/2016, 11:05 - Cindy LEUNG: can i work at the economist now
03/12/2016, 11:05 - Mom: Kkk
03/12/2016, 11:06 - Cindy LEUNG: i can totally work there, i noticed this earlier than them
03/12/2016, 11:06 - Mom: U always have the ability, judt the opportunity
03/12/2016, 11:07 - Cindy LEUNG: i think
03/12/2016, 11:07 - Cindy LEUNG: this is a great time to get that phd
03/12/2016, 11:12 - Mom: üòÆüòÆ
03/12/2016, 11:14 - Cindy LEUNG: did u see that link isent u
03/12/2016, 11:15 - Mom: toronto?
03/12/2016, 11:15 - Mom: i read it
03/12/2016, 11:15 - Cindy LEUNG: yah
03/12/2016, 11:16 - Cindy LEUNG: rmb they prescribed me ritalin.
03/12/2016, 11:16 - Mom: have u read it before u come to conclusion that dopamine affect ur symtpoms
03/12/2016, 11:16 - Mom: yea
03/12/2016, 11:16 - Cindy LEUNG: no after
03/12/2016, 11:16 - Cindy LEUNG: that is confirmation
03/12/2016, 11:16 - Mom: but do u think ritalin works on u?
03/12/2016, 11:16 - Cindy LEUNG: thats the point
03/12/2016, 11:16 - Cindy LEUNG: ritalin is a dopamine reuptake inhibitor
03/12/2016, 11:17 - Mom: that's also my question abt ur diagnosis?
03/12/2016, 11:17 - Cindy LEUNG: so by chance or whatever, they actually prescribed the right med
03/12/2016, 11:17 - Cindy LEUNG: thing is because when i was taking ritalin
03/12/2016, 11:17 - Cindy LEUNG: i was doing so concurrent with the ivig tiral
03/12/2016, 11:17 - Cindy LEUNG: trial
03/12/2016, 11:18 - Cindy LEUNG: so i think we should try ritalin again
03/12/2016, 11:18 - Cindy LEUNG: since we have shit tons of it
03/12/2016, 11:18 - Mom: errr...
03/12/2016, 11:18 - Mom: better try it in summer
03/12/2016, 11:18 - Cindy LEUNG: its fast acting so two weeks is enough to see result
03/12/2016, 11:19 - Cindy LEUNG: but dopamine is very hard to raise levels.
03/12/2016, 11:19 - Cindy LEUNG: and stimulant is only temporary solution
03/12/2016, 11:19 - Cindy LEUNG: so again we still persist with that problem
03/12/2016, 11:19 - Mom: amphetamine also has side effects
03/12/2016, 11:20 - Cindy LEUNG: ritalin is methylphenidate
03/12/2016, 11:20 - Mom: that means additional probs will be added to ur body other than the original one?
03/12/2016, 11:20 - Cindy LEUNG: but ur right, prolonged amphetamine use will throw dopamine system out of whack
03/12/2016, 11:20 - Mom: wud ppl have tolerance for ritalin?
03/12/2016, 11:21 - Cindy LEUNG: probably it works like caffeine
03/12/2016, 11:21 - Cindy LEUNG: but i'm just proposing we try for 2 weeks to see how the body actually responds to it
03/12/2016, 11:22 - Mom: u just want to confirm ur disorder rite?
03/12/2016, 11:22 - Cindy LEUNG: pretty much
03/12/2016, 11:22 - Cindy LEUNG: just need to confirm what i speculate so far is true
03/12/2016, 11:23 - Cindy LEUNG: I also review the MSLT results.
03/12/2016, 11:23 - Mom: rmb Leanne, she said she just took ritalin randomly becoz of its effectiveness?
03/12/2016, 11:23 - Cindy LEUNG: what do you mean?
03/12/2016, 11:23 - Cindy LEUNG: by randomy?
03/12/2016, 11:26 - Mom: not quite sure yet, but just wonder if ritalin's effect is like caffeine
03/12/2016, 11:26 - Cindy LEUNG: yea u have the right idea
03/12/2016, 11:26 - Mom: actually not the right med
03/12/2016, 11:26 - Cindy LEUNG: er not don't understand again?
03/12/2016, 11:26 - Cindy LEUNG: i don't geddit.
03/12/2016, 11:27 - Cindy LEUNG: if u compare both caffeine and ritalin they're both stimulats
03/12/2016, 11:27 - Cindy LEUNG: stimulants
03/12/2016, 11:27 - Cindy LEUNG: but i'm saying that ritalin was the right drug to prescribe cuz it inhibits reuptake of dopamine, which means more dopamine is present in the system
03/12/2016, 11:27 - Mom: coffee makes ppl more alert, but effect isn't even
03/12/2016, 11:28 - Mom: like me, i don't react to coffee, but some ppl can't sleep even with a sip of it
03/12/2016, 11:28 - Cindy LEUNG: i don't know what system caffeine works on so, can't compare on the biological level.
03/12/2016, 11:28 - Cindy LEUNG: thats because u develop tolerance
03/12/2016, 11:29 - Cindy LEUNG: is just teh body doing homeostasis
03/12/2016, 11:29 - Cindy LEUNG: hormones operate at a steady state in teh body
03/12/2016, 11:30 - Mom: i don't think i get coffee tolerance, i rather think it didn't work on my neurotransmitters
03/12/2016, 11:30 - Cindy LEUNG: impossible
03/12/2016, 11:30 - Cindy LEUNG: this is science.
03/12/2016, 11:30 - Cindy LEUNG: u get caffeine from a lot of things
03/12/2016, 11:30 - Cindy LEUNG: not just coffee.
03/12/2016, 11:31 - Mom: my experience with coffee isn't to stay alert for the whole night
03/12/2016, 11:31 - Mom: i never had this experience even the first sip
03/12/2016, 11:31 - Cindy LEUNG: ok awake and alert
03/12/2016, 11:31 - Cindy LEUNG: are two different concepts
03/12/2016, 11:32 - Mom: but i still can't drink too much coffee in a day
03/12/2016, 11:32 - Cindy LEUNG: why what happens if u do
03/12/2016, 11:32 - Mom: yawn and feel tired i guess
03/12/2016, 11:32 - Cindy LEUNG: if u drink too much?
03/12/2016, 11:32 - Cindy LEUNG: whats too much
03/12/2016, 11:32 - Mom: yea
03/12/2016, 11:33 - Cindy LEUNG: how much coffee do you even have in a day?
03/12/2016, 11:33 - Mom: more than 3 cups a days for like a week
03/12/2016, 11:33 - Cindy LEUNG: but u drink instant
03/12/2016, 11:33 - Mom: i can only tolerate 1 - 2 cups
03/12/2016, 11:33 - Cindy LEUNG: u want effect, go drink three americanos in a day
03/12/2016, 11:33 - Mom: yea
03/12/2016, 11:34 - Mom: not the arousal effect
03/12/2016, 11:34 - Cindy LEUNG: thats pretty normal here
03/12/2016, 11:34 - Cindy LEUNG: what do you mean
03/12/2016, 11:34 - Cindy LEUNG: wait, start from the top
03/12/2016, 11:35 - Mom: forgot abt my coffee experience
03/12/2016, 11:35 - Mom: i just want to point out that i have unanswerable question abt ritalin
03/12/2016, 11:36 - Cindy LEUNG: what's teh question
03/12/2016, 11:37 - Mom: is ritalin the drug appropriate to sleep disorder?
03/12/2016, 11:37 - Mom: u know drs also prescribe ritalin to kids with adhd, why?
03/12/2016, 11:37 - Mom: also probs with dopamine levels?
03/12/2016, 11:38 - Cindy LEUNG: yea adhd have lower levels of dopamine
03/12/2016, 11:38 - Cindy LEUNG: so adhd have symptoms like brain fog as well
03/12/2016, 11:39 - Cindy LEUNG: depending on their type
03/12/2016, 11:40 - Mom: ok, if ritalin raises dopamine levels
03/12/2016, 11:40 - Cindy LEUNG: no ritalin inhibits dopamine reuptake
03/12/2016, 11:40 - Mom: dopamine is the source of happiness rite?
03/12/2016, 11:40 - Cindy LEUNG: idk if it increases dopamine levels
03/12/2016, 11:40 - Cindy LEUNG: it depends on how much precursor is avaliable
03/12/2016, 11:40 - Mom: in other words, raise the dopamine levels stay in ur brain
03/12/2016, 11:41 - Cindy LEUNG: increasing an equilibrium depends on many variables
03/12/2016, 11:42 - Cindy LEUNG: yes dopamine makes the brain feel good
03/12/2016, 11:42 - Cindy LEUNG: its part of the reward circuitry
03/12/2016, 11:43 - Mom: wud this also increases the chance of having cataplexy attack?
03/12/2016, 11:43 - Mom: cuz emotion turns out to be stronger in this sense
03/12/2016, 11:44 - Cindy LEUNG: well if u go back to teh toronto article
03/12/2016, 11:45 - Cindy LEUNG: it suggests that cataplexy and sleep attacks are caused by dysfunction at different dopamine receptor sites
03/12/2016, 11:45 - Cindy LEUNG: so one should not affect the other.
03/12/2016, 11:46 - Cindy LEUNG: so in mice, d1 activity affects hypersomnia and d2 -- cataplexy
03/12/2016, 11:46 - Cindy LEUNG: we don't know if that's the same in humans or not cuz we have more dopamine receptors
03/12/2016, 11:47 - Mom: üò°
03/12/2016, 11:47 - Cindy LEUNG: why angry face?
03/12/2016, 11:48 - Mom: i was thinking why human beings r so complex, almost impossible to understand
03/12/2016, 11:50 - Cindy LEUNG: this is just like econ, its cuz u have a system so it interacts with many parts, so u can't just boost up one thing and expect it to come out as expected.
03/12/2016, 11:50 - Cindy LEUNG: thats why u have to pay to study this stuff.
03/12/2016, 11:51 - Mom: üòûüòûüòû
03/12/2016, 11:51 - Cindy LEUNG: also moving on
03/12/2016, 11:51 - Cindy LEUNG: if you look at this:
03/12/2016, 11:51 - Cindy LEUNG: http://www.utstat.toronto.edu/alisong/Teaching/1112/Sta490/sample1.pdf
03/12/2016, 11:52 - Cindy LEUNG: this is a very good evaluation of the MSLT test
03/12/2016, 11:52 - Cindy LEUNG: also noticed that is also from toronto
03/12/2016, 11:53 - Mom: why toronto produces so many good thingy
03/12/2016, 11:53 - Cindy LEUNG: dunno but seems liek canada medicine is really good
03/12/2016, 11:54 - Cindy LEUNG: anyways
03/12/2016, 11:54 - Cindy LEUNG: key observations:
03/12/2016, 11:54 - Mom: that's why so many american students go to canada for studying
03/12/2016, 11:54 - Cindy LEUNG: presence of sleep onset REM is determinant of n+C
03/12/2016, 11:54 - Cindy LEUNG: SOREMs
03/12/2016, 11:54 - Cindy LEUNG: for short
03/12/2016, 11:55 - Cindy LEUNG: notice on page 3 it mentions that the patients perception of fatigue is uncorrelated with SOREMs
03/12/2016, 11:56 - Cindy LEUNG: so what they're saying is that you don't need to feel tired to have sleep onset rem
03/12/2016, 11:57 - Mom: kkk
03/12/2016, 11:57 - Cindy LEUNG: notice that mean of SOREM group is statistically significant to non-SOREM group
03/12/2016, 11:57 - Cindy LEUNG: for MSLT
03/12/2016, 11:58 - Mom: so
03/12/2016, 11:58 - Cindy LEUNG: so this is significantly lower
03/12/2016, 11:59 - Mom: ik
03/12/2016, 11:59 - Cindy LEUNG: why do you think the mslt is unreliable?
03/12/2016, 11:59 - Mom: this is how they define narcolepsy
03/12/2016, 12:00 - Cindy LEUNG: yes
03/12/2016, 12:00 - Cindy LEUNG: because normal people do not have SOREMs
03/12/2016, 12:00 - Cindy LEUNG: no to mention SOREMs are detectable by eeg as well..
03/12/2016, 12:02 - Mom: hmm
03/12/2016, 12:05 - Cindy LEUNG: this paper concludes that there is some effect of SOREM on sleepiness/fatigue
03/12/2016, 12:05 - Cindy LEUNG: http://www.utstat.toronto.edu/alisong/Teaching/1112/Sta490/sample2.pdf
03/12/2016, 12:08 - Cindy LEUNG: diagnosis for narcolepsy is two or more SOREMs
03/12/2016, 12:08 - Mom: ikik
03/12/2016, 12:09 - Cindy LEUNG: i'll assume that that's credible
03/12/2016, 12:09 - Cindy LEUNG: since it was probably determined after a lot of research
03/12/2016, 12:10 - Cindy LEUNG: this paper suggests that SOREMs are also prevalent in non narcoleptic population
03/12/2016, 12:10 - Cindy LEUNG: https://www.journalsleep.org/articles/290705.pdf
03/12/2016, 12:11 - Cindy LEUNG: it concludes that shift workers, young adults, patients with apnea) are likely to have a greater prevalence of SOREM
03/12/2016, 12:11 - Cindy LEUNG: ok so what do we know so far:
03/12/2016, 12:12 - Cindy LEUNG: - 2 MSLTs show that i have SOREMs
03/12/2016, 12:13 - Cindy LEUNG: - i also know that I go into SOREM really quickly, cuz i get vivid dreams during my 20 min naps
03/12/2016, 12:13 - Cindy LEUNG: - i also know that i get hypnagogic hallucinations going into and out of sleep
03/12/2016, 12:15 - Cindy LEUNG: - also eeg report at the tst neurologist had presence of k-complexes
03/12/2016, 12:16 - Cindy LEUNG: conclude it is highly likely that i have hypersomnia or sleep apnea
03/12/2016, 12:17 - Cindy LEUNG: presence of sleep apnea would be the only thing which would suggest that i don't actually have narcolepsy
03/12/2016, 12:20 - Cindy LEUNG: hello are you still there?
03/12/2016, 12:20 - Mom: i am here
03/12/2016, 12:21 - Mom: but üòûüòû
03/12/2016, 12:21 - Cindy LEUNG: do i have actual sleep apnea?
03/12/2016, 12:21 - Mom: u have the answer already
03/12/2016, 12:22 - Cindy LEUNG: what do you mean
03/12/2016, 12:22 - Cindy LEUNG: sleep report suggest i don't
03/12/2016, 12:22 - Cindy LEUNG: but first sleep report and second report had discrepancies over the amount of times apnea happened
03/12/2016, 12:23 - Mom: u spent for like 20 mins to convince a mother that her daughter has narco
03/12/2016, 12:23 - Mom: isn't it?
03/12/2016, 12:24 - Cindy LEUNG: yea pretty much i guess
03/12/2016, 12:24 - Cindy LEUNG: r u convinced
03/12/2016, 12:25 - Cindy LEUNG: even if i don't have narco i have sleep apnea
03/12/2016, 12:26 - Mom: i'll wait to see changes
03/12/2016, 12:28 - Cindy LEUNG: i think stress just aggravate condition
03/12/2016, 12:29 - Cindy LEUNG: so u observe changes
03/12/2016, 12:29 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz i'm under different amounts of stress at different time of the year
03/12/2016, 12:29 - Mom: i wonder why stress affects ur condition so much now?
03/12/2016, 12:30 - Cindy LEUNG: because my immune system is weakened in my cns
03/12/2016, 12:30 - Mom: i didn't see u complained abt stress before
03/12/2016, 12:31 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz i didn't have health problems everytime i was stressed
03/12/2016, 12:32 - Cindy LEUNG: and irregular sleep puts stress on body
03/12/2016, 12:33 - Mom: this is the main problem, unable to maintain sleep
03/12/2016, 12:34 - Cindy LEUNG: i can sleep now
03/12/2016, 12:34 - Mom: in what sense?
03/12/2016, 12:34 - Cindy LEUNG: but if i get stressed then even if i sleep regularly it doesn't really help
03/12/2016, 12:34 - Cindy LEUNG: like i go to bed at 12 or 1 and then i just stay in bed until it finish sleeping
03/12/2016, 12:34 - Cindy LEUNG: so i got up at 10 today
03/12/2016, 12:35 - Mom: no intermediate wake up?
03/12/2016, 12:35 - Cindy LEUNG: i did i woke up at4
03/12/2016, 12:36 - Cindy LEUNG: i think i can handle showing up to class and watching lecture doing problem set
03/12/2016, 12:36 - Cindy LEUNG: but anything more than that
03/12/2016, 12:36 - Cindy LEUNG: like if we need to hand in essay
03/12/2016, 12:36 - Cindy LEUNG: it messes up with my schedule
03/12/2016, 12:36 - Cindy LEUNG: and then i get really fucking stressed
03/12/2016, 12:36 - Cindy LEUNG: and then i swing
03/12/2016, 12:36 - Mom: err...
03/12/2016, 12:37 - Cindy LEUNG: i also think i should just drop the society work cuz i can't handle that shit.
03/12/2016, 12:37 - Cindy LEUNG: even though its not a lot of work
03/12/2016, 12:38 - Cindy LEUNG: the more mini tasks i get, the easier it is for stress to escalate
03/12/2016, 12:38 - Cindy LEUNG: that's just internal stress
03/12/2016, 12:39 - Cindy LEUNG: and then i get sick whenever the weather changes :(
03/12/2016, 12:43 - Mom: ur immune system is weakened by those ivig?
03/12/2016, 12:53 - Cindy LEUNG: hi
03/12/2016, 12:53 - Mom: wat?
03/12/2016, 12:54 - Cindy LEUNG: i just went into sleep?
03/12/2016, 12:54 - Mom: ohhh

03/12/2016, 12:56 - Cindy LEUNG: i think i rem
03/12/2016, 12:56 - Cindy LEUNG: i saw myself flying/ hovering around and around in a room
03/12/2016, 12:56 - Cindy LEUNG: i thought i was at home
03/12/2016, 12:57 - Cindy LEUNG: its like a continuation of what i was actually doing, (explaining my symptoms to you on whatsapps)
03/12/2016, 12:56 - Mom: where home?
03/12/2016, 12:56 - Mom: TST tower or tsing yi?
03/12/2016, 12:57 - Cindy LEUNG: and then i started hovering/ flying around and around in the room
03/12/2016, 12:57 - Cindy LEUNG: dunno
03/12/2016, 12:57 - Cindy LEUNG: unspecified
03/12/2016, 12:57 - Cindy LEUNG: i thought it was my house
03/12/2016, 12:57 - Cindy LEUNG: but i couldn't recognize the place
03/12/2016, 12:57 - Mom: ok
03/12/2016, 12:58 - Cindy LEUNG: and then i kind of flew in an upright position
03/12/2016, 12:58 - Mom: emotionally ur linked to ur home
03/12/2016, 12:58 - Cindy LEUNG: with my mouth open and tongue skewed
03/12/2016, 12:58 - Cindy LEUNG: and head slightly tipped
03/12/2016, 12:58 - Cindy LEUNG: around and around
03/12/2016, 12:58 - Cindy LEUNG: i could even go through walls
03/12/2016, 12:59 - Cindy LEUNG: but then my body part which was in the wall would hurt like friction burn
03/12/2016, 12:59 - Mom: oob experience
03/12/2016, 12:59 - Cindy LEUNG: no
03/12/2016, 12:59 - Cindy LEUNG: it was a dram
03/12/2016, 12:59 - Cindy LEUNG: dream
03/12/2016, 12:59 - Cindy LEUNG: and then for some reason
03/12/2016, 12:59 - Cindy LEUNG: i knew how to find you
03/12/2016, 12:59 - Mom: u can feel pain in ur dream
03/12/2016, 12:59 - Cindy LEUNG: yea just now
03/12/2016, 12:59 - Cindy LEUNG: like discomfort
03/12/2016, 12:59 - Cindy LEUNG: not exactly pain
03/12/2016, 13:00 - Mom: i think it's ur heart feeling
03/12/2016, 13:00 - Cindy LEUNG: its no in the chest area
03/12/2016, 13:00 - Cindy LEUNG: its my leg
03/12/2016, 13:00 - Cindy LEUNG: cuz i kept flying into the wall
03/12/2016, 13:00 - Mom: u said pain in ur leg?
03/12/2016, 13:00 - Cindy LEUNG: no
03/12/2016, 13:00 - Cindy LEUNG: yea
03/12/2016, 13:00 - Cindy LEUNG: my leg kept sticking into the wall
03/12/2016, 13:00 - Cindy LEUNG: because i can fly through walls
03/12/2016, 13:01 - Cindy LEUNG: i can fly through objects
03/12/2016, 13:01 - Mom: blood circulation problem?
03/12/2016, 13:01 - Cindy LEUNG: but my leg hurt
03/12/2016, 13:01 - Mom: can u see urself laying on bed?
03/12/2016, 13:01 - Cindy LEUNG: o
03/12/2016, 13:01 - Cindy LEUNG: no

03/12/2016, 13:01 - Mom: kkk
03/12/2016, 13:01 - Cindy LEUNG: its just a dream
03/12/2016, 13:01 - Cindy LEUNG: so i knew how to find you
03/12/2016, 13:01 - Mom: where to find me?
03/12/2016, 13:01 - Cindy LEUNG: and then i ask u to hold me down so i don't fly away
03/12/2016, 13:02 - Cindy LEUNG: like u were in the living room
03/12/2016, 13:02 - Cindy LEUNG: and i was flying around in my room
03/12/2016, 13:02 - Cindy LEUNG: the livign room was very empty
03/12/2016, 13:02 - Cindy LEUNG: there was like no furniture
03/12/2016, 13:03 - Mom: like just have walls
03/12/2016, 13:03 - Cindy LEUNG: except u were at a desk using computer
03/12/2016, 13:03 - Cindy LEUNG: yah
03/12/2016, 13:03 - Cindy LEUNG: my room had desk, computer
03/12/2016, 13:03 - Cindy LEUNG: and white plaster walsl
03/12/2016, 13:03 - Cindy LEUNG: walls
03/12/2016, 13:03 - Mom: what am i doing?
03/12/2016, 13:03 - Cindy LEUNG: on the computer
03/12/2016, 13:03 - Cindy LEUNG: talking to me on whatsapp i guess
03/12/2016, 13:03 - Cindy LEUNG: and then i hovered across the living room
03/12/2016, 13:04 - Cindy LEUNG: and then u saw me do that, and then u were like progression is worse than i thought
03/12/2016, 13:04 - Mom: did u see other ppl around?
03/12/2016, 13:04 - Cindy LEUNG: no
03/12/2016, 13:04 - Cindy LEUNG: and then i was like can you hold me down so i stop flying
03/12/2016, 13:04 - Cindy LEUNG: and then you did that and it seems to have worked
03/12/2016, 13:05 - Mom: so u woke up?
03/12/2016, 13:05 - Cindy LEUNG: yea
03/12/2016, 13:06 - Cindy LEUNG: and when i woke up
03/12/2016, 13:06 - Cindy LEUNG: my mouth was open
03/12/2016, 13:06 - Cindy LEUNG: and my tongue was slack to one side
03/12/2016, 13:06 - Cindy LEUNG: i know my mouth was open, cuz my tongue is dried out
03/12/2016, 13:07 - Cindy LEUNG: and a few times people have told me they saw me sleeeping iwth my mouth open
03/12/2016, 13:07 - Mom: yea, u always sleep with ur mouth open since the start of ur illness
03/12/2016, 13:07 - Mom: ur tongue slack to one side
03/12/2016, 13:07 - Cindy LEUNG: eyah
03/12/2016, 13:07 - Cindy LEUNG: yeah
03/12/2016, 13:08 - Cindy LEUNG: i just wasn't sure about the tongue cuz i have no way of observing
03/12/2016, 13:08 - Mom: looks like muscles totally relax during sleep
03/12/2016, 13:09 - Cindy LEUNG: that's rem
03/12/2016, 13:09 - Cindy LEUNG: i wonder if this is what they call a sleep attacked?
03/12/2016, 13:09 - Cindy LEUNG: attack
03/12/2016, 13:10 - Cindy LEUNG: to be fair, these are not that common
03/12/2016, 13:10 - Mom: sleep attack lasts for only few seconds, won't have rem
03/12/2016, 13:10 - Cindy LEUNG: right
03/12/2016, 13:10 - Mom: u have lots of rem
03/12/2016, 13:11 - Cindy LEUNG: this is a bit like avocado sleep as well
03/12/2016, 13:11 - Mom: rem after avocado?
03/12/2016, 13:11 - Cindy LEUNG: yes i rem after avoacdo
03/12/2016, 13:11 - Cindy LEUNG: but i also rem nearly everyday in the morning
03/12/2016, 13:11 - Mom: looks like every time u sleep, u rem
03/12/2016, 13:12 - Cindy LEUNG: so i don't know if it was actually due to the avocado
03/12/2016, 13:12 - Cindy LEUNG: no sometimes i sleep without re
03/12/2016, 13:12 - Cindy LEUNG: rem
03/12/2016, 13:12 - Mom: daytime nap?
03/12/2016, 13:12 - Cindy LEUNG: that's when my head tips fowards, facedown
03/12/2016, 13:12 - Cindy LEUNG: i forget that i slept
03/12/2016, 13:13 - Cindy LEUNG: and only realise once i wake up
03/12/2016, 13:13 - Cindy LEUNG: and no dreams
03/12/2016, 13:13 - Cindy LEUNG: but these are less frequent
03/12/2016, 13:14 - Cindy LEUNG: did we talk about hyperventilation
03/12/2016, 13:14 - Mom: u had that these days
03/12/2016, 13:15 - Mom: did u also have it at yr13?
03/12/2016, 13:16 - Cindy LEUNG: er..
03/12/2016, 13:16 - Cindy LEUNG: don't remember right now
03/12/2016, 13:16 - Cindy LEUNG: i had it yesterday before the jaw locking
03/12/2016, 13:17 - Mom: also jaw locking is rare in narco case
03/12/2016, 13:19 - Mom: u had so many different symptoms, so i also wonder if it's narco??
03/12/2016, 13:19 - Cindy LEUNG: the ivig also had its own side effects
03/12/2016, 13:20 - Cindy LEUNG: i seem to have narco and other stuff
03/12/2016, 13:22 - Cindy LEUNG: so symptoms of narco is eds, cataplexy, sleep para and hallucinations
03/12/2016, 13:22 - Cindy LEUNG: i display the later three but not eds
03/12/2016, 13:22 - Cindy LEUNG: lol
03/12/2016, 13:22 - Cindy LEUNG: u don't necessarily need to have all  to have narco
03/12/2016, 13:23 - Cindy LEUNG: and to be fair, i do have some level of eds
03/12/2016, 13:23 - Mom: but main things shud be eds, cataplexy?
03/12/2016, 13:23 - Cindy LEUNG: cataplexy is a check
03/12/2016, 13:24 - Cindy LEUNG: if i differentiate the dizzy spells and the collapses, i would say i do respond to funny things like cataplexy
03/12/2016, 13:29 - Mom: rmb the athletic who had jaw jet after breaking the world record in Olympic game, why he showed this cataleptic response? i'm sure he definite won't have narco
03/12/2016, 13:31 - Mom: r cataplexy and sleep disorder actually have no correlation ?
03/12/2016, 13:32 - Cindy LEUNG: you talking about bob beamon right?
03/12/2016, 13:33 - Mom: don't remember his name
03/12/2016, 13:34 - Cindy LEUNG: The long jumper
03/12/2016, 13:34 - Mom: yea
03/12/2016, 13:34 - Cindy LEUNG: We don't know
03/12/2016, 13:35 - Cindy LEUNG: Obviously there is correlation between hypersomnia and cataplexy or else 70% of narcoleptics would not hv it
03/12/2016, 13:37 - Mom: kkk
03/12/2016, 13:39 - Cindy LEUNG: we don't know how their systems interact.
03/12/2016, 13:39 - Cindy LEUNG: like why is orexin important?
03/12/2016, 13:39 - Cindy LEUNG: obviously the question should be is cataplexy itself associated with absence of orexin
03/12/2016, 13:40 - Cindy LEUNG: my guess right now is that orexin plays a role in rem regulation
03/12/2016, 13:40 - Mom: this is the question?
03/12/2016, 13:41 - Cindy LEUNG: i seem to rem a lot more than normal people
03/12/2016, 13:41 - Mom: yea
03/12/2016, 13:41 - Mom: how many times did u count for ur rem everyday?
03/12/2016, 13:43 - Cindy LEUNG: ok it we count rem thats actually countable
03/12/2016, 13:43 - Cindy LEUNG: 1ep since i woke up this morning
03/12/2016, 13:43 - Cindy LEUNG: i usually get 1 or 2
03/12/2016, 13:43 - Cindy LEUNG: during the day
03/12/2016, 13:44 - Mom: so altogether 2 - 3 rem rite?
03/12/2016, 13:44 - Cindy LEUNG: i guess
